“All of these restrictions, they sound more like communism,” said Florin Cimpean, senior pastor at Philadelphia Romanian Church of God in the Ravenswood neighborhood, one of several dozen religious leaders who gathered Thursday outside the Thompson Center to take issue with Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s stay-at-home order.

But Cimpean, who said he grew up in Soviet-controlled Romania, added: “Not even communists were able to completely shut down churches. We are essential. The spiritual, emotional and mental impact of this [coronavirus] will probably be greater long-term than the medical one.”

Cimpean said his church held services last week with about 40 people in attendance and plans to do so again this weekend — a violation of Pritzker’s order, which allows for a maximum religious gathering of 10 people, regardless of place of worship’s size.

The gathering Thursday came on the heels of a victory a day earlier for Pritzker, whose order survived a religious challenge in federal court from a pair of churches that sought to hold worship services with strict social-distancing guidelines in place.

The pastors gathered at the Thompson Center say the 10-person limit is arbitrary and doesn’t take into account the size of churches — some of which have large sanctuaries and could, they say, safely handle more parishioners.

Pastor Charles Mironas of Hope Community Bible Church in Park Ridge echoed the sentiments of his fellow religious leaders when he described the church as “essential.”

“If ever the world needed a church, it’s now,” Mironas said. “We are a balm of healing to the community. People need to know there is hope, need to know that there are answers.”

The pastors say they weren’t given a voice — weren’t invited to the table — before Pritzker issued his order.

Wilson, who organized the event, said the order doesn’t recognize that many in poorer communities might not have the option to shift services online, as has become common in more affluent North Side communities.

“You have a lot of homes in the poor communities that don’t even have Wi-Fi,” Wilson said. “They don’t have the technology. They can’t afford it.”

Mayor Lori Lightfoot has said she has no interest in having noncomplying parishioners or pastors arrested, but has also said she’ll do what needs to be done to make sure the rules are followed.

Asked if he’s concerned that violating the stay-at-home order might lead to an arrest, Cimpean said: “I don’t think the mayor will do that. But if they want to do that, let them come. It is what it is.”",real

But the Blackhawks safely can mark down a 12th consecutive NHL attendance title.

When the 2019-20 season was paused March 11, the Hawks were averaging 21,441 fans for 34 home games at the United Center, topping the Canadiens’ average of 21,085 for the highest mark in hockey.

Taking outdoor games out of the equation, the Hawks have led the league in attendance every season since 2008-09. That’s the same season their ongoing 531-game sellout streak began.

Blackhawks’ Attendance History Season Attendance Rank Season Attendance Rank 2019-20 21,441 1st 2018-19 21,339 1st 2017-18 21,653 1st 2016-17 21,751 1st 2015-16 21,859 1st 2014-15 21,769 1st 2013-14 21,616 1st 2012-13 21,775 1st 2011-12 21,553 1st 2010-11 21,423 1st 2009-10 21,356 1st 2008-09 21,783 1st

And while there is increasing optimism leaguewide that the 2019-20 regular season eventually will restart, there’s little chance that resumption will take place in Chicago and even lower odds that fans will be able to attend the rescheduled games.

After all, the logistics of hosting a crowd of 20,000-plus in the coronavirus era — not to mention the various governmental bans across the United States and Canada, including in Illinois, on large public gatherings — would be impossible.

Even looking ahead to 2020-21, it’s very possible that part or all of the season could be played without fans.

The NHL reportedly is looking at another strange calendar for the coming season. If the 2020 Stanley Cup isn’t awarded until September, as the latest resumption plan suggests, the 2020-21 season might not start until December and might not end until July. And the league has no control over COVID-19 test and vaccine availability, both of which will have a huge effect on when spectators safely can return to large sporting arenas.

So the Hawks can chalk up the 2019-20 attendance title as theirs without much hesitation. But the fact that it might be a while before they get a chance to defend that title somewhat overrides the positivity.

Plus, longtime president John McDonough — widely credited as the mastermind behind the Hawks’ marketing and ticket-sales dynasty that coincided with the team’s on-ice dynasty — is gone after nearly 13 years in the position.

Although much mystery about the reasons for McDonough’s firing remains, the plummeting resale value of Hawks tickets and the starting-to-decline number of season-ticket holders — two trends that threaten to break the sellout streak — might have been factors.

In other words, 2019-20 might prove to be the last season of league-leading attendance on Madison Street.

2019-20 Attendance Review

• The Hawks’ average crowd of 21,441 represented a small increase from the average of 21,339 last season, ending a streak of four annual declines.

• The largest crowd (21,878) came when the Hawks hosted the Predators on Feb. 21.

• The smallest crowd (21,172) came when the Hawks hosted the Golden Knights on Oct. 22.

• A crowd of 21,275 attended the Hawks’ game against the Sharks on March 11, the day before the season was halted.

• The average weekday crowd was 21,444, four more than the average weekend crowd of 21,440.

• Games against Central Division rivals were slightly more popular, drawing an average of 21,519 fans, compared with 21,405 for non-division games.

• The Hawks had 19 home games start at 7:30 p.m. and averaged 21,435 fans at those games. They had 15 games start at other times (although only one before 6 p.m.) and averaged 21,448 fans at those.",real
1029,https://www.businessinsider.com/jack-dorsey-already-donated-73-million-covid-19-relief-2020-5,2020-05-15,Jack Dorsey just unveiled where he's donated more than $87 million of his pledged $1 billion towards COVID-19 relief,"Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has donated over $87 million towards his COVID-19 relief pledge.

His donations have ranged across a number of causes from stopping domestic violence, to giving equal access to the internet for students.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey announced last month that he was donating $1 billion of his Square equity to COVID-19 relief, and so far he's dispersed over $87 million.

Dorsey created a new charity fund called Start Small LLC, which will initially focus on relief efforts to help with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Dorsey estimated that the fund is around 28% of his total wealth.

The Twitter CEO released a spreadsheet, which so far only shows $73 million in donations, accounting for how much and to where donations are being made. According to the spreadsheet, Dorsey has made contributions to organizations tackling domestic violence due to the pandemic, HIV/AIDS, refugees, advocacy for prisoners, among many others.

However, in a tweet, Dorsey added that there are several initiatives that have not been added to the spreadsheet yet.

Dorsey has so far donated over $1.3 million to two organizations that will screen for HIV as well as address how the current pandemic is impacting HIV in marginalized communities.

""Funds will support the Elton John AIDS Foundation (EJAF) COVID-19 Emergency Fund to support EJAF frontline partners to respond to the pandemic and its' effects on HIV prevention and care for the most marginalized communities,"" Dorsey's spreadsheet wrote.

Experts have worried efforts to limit the spread of and treat infectious diseases like HIV could be significantly reduced due to the pandemic.

Tolbert Nyenswah, a research associate at Johns Hopkins University, previously told Business Insider that in countries where patients rely on clinics for medication, a lack of personal protective equipment means entire facilities that many rely on could be shut down if one hospital worker gets sicks.

That leaves people dealing with infectious diseases at risk. ""This will have longtime consequences for decades to come,"" Nyenswah said

Domestic violence has also increased as more people were sheltering in place. Business Insider previously reported that calls to hotlines in major cities increased during the lockdown. Dorsey is funding multiple initiatives to address the concern totaling more than $2.2 million.

He's also invested in organizations that provide necessary food for people in need, providing support for the homeless, mental health initiatives, as well as $10 million into the Oakland School Fund to close the educational gap between students who don't access to the internet and those who do.

According to The San Francisco Chronicle, officials in Oakland launched the initiative on Thursday to raise $12.5 million for 25,000 laptops and internet hotspots to families in the city. In a tweet Dorsey' wrote that he saw the initiative and funded it ""immediately.""

""$10mm to give EVERY single child in Oakland access to a laptop and internet in their homes, closing the digital divide,"" he wrote on Twitter.

The Chronicle added that 50,000 students in the cities public school system ""are disconnected or under-connected from technology at home.""

752,https://chicago.suntimes.com/coronavirus/2020/5/10/21253827/becoming-king-of-ventilators-may-result-in-unexpected-glut,2020-05-10,Becoming ‘King of Ventilators’ may result in unexpected glut,"WASHINGTON — As requests for ventilators from the national stockpile reached a crescendo in late March, President Donald Trump made what seemed like a bold claim: His administration would have 100,000 within 100 days.

At the time, the Department of Health and Human Services had not ordered any new ventilators since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in January. But records show that over the following three weeks, the agency scrambled to turn Trump’s pledge into a reality, spending nearly $3 billion to spur U.S. manufacturers to crank out the breathing machines at an unprecedented pace.

An analysis of federal contracting data by The Associated Press shows the agency is now on track to exceed 100,000 new ventilators by around July 13, about a week later than the 100-day deadline Trump first gave on March 27.

By the end of 2020, the administration is expected to take delivery of nearly 200,000 new ventilators, based on the AP’s review of current federal purchasing contracts. That would more than double the estimated 160,000 ventilators hospitals across the U.S. had before the pandemic.

“We became the king of ventilators, thousands and thousands of ventilators,” Trump boasted in an April 29 speech.

But over the past month, demand for ventilators has decreased even as the U.S. death toll from the novel coronavirus has surged past 80,000. After observing unusually high death rates for coronavirus victims who were put on ventilators, many doctors are using them only as a last resort.

That’s raising the unexpected prospect that the United States could soon be awash in surplus ventilators, so much so the White House is now planning to ship thousands overseas to help boost the virus response of other nations.

In a speech to Republican members of Congress on Friday, the president credited his son-in-law, White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, with heading up the effort to purchase the ventilators.

“We built, and we built, and we built,” Trump said. “Now we have nine factories that are throwing out ventilators at numbers that nobody can believe. It was really — there’s not been anything like that, since the Second World War, where we did the same thing with other types of product.”

Daniel Adelman, a professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business who teaches health care analytics, said the U.S. government is now buying more than twice the number of ventilators it needs, even under a worst-case scenario forecasting the spread of COVID-19.

But Adelman said mathematical models cannot predict with certainty how many ventilators will be needed if there is a resurgence of the coronavirus later in the year or if there is another pandemic in the future.

“It seems incongruent with the forecasts that you’re seeing,” Adelman said of the government purchases. “I’d probably rather they order too many rather than ordering too few.”

In patients with severe cases of COVID-19, the virus attacks the lungs, causing fluid to collect in tiny air sacs called alveoli. That makes it difficult for the lungs to transfer oxygen from the air to the blood, which can be deadly. To treat these low oxygen levels, doctors have historically relied on ventilators.

The Strategic National Stockpile, the federal government’s emergency reserve of medical supplies, had about 16,660 ventilators ready to deploy at the start of March, with an additional 2,400 out for maintenance.

By the middle of the month, health officials and governors in states with the worst virus outbreaks began expressing concerns that the supply of breathing machines could run out, potentially leaving thousands of critically ill patients gasping for air.

Among those calling for additional ventilators was Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D-N.Y.), who predicted on March 24 that all of the ventilators in his state would be in use, and patients in need would be left without proper treatment. Cuomo said projections showed New York would need at least 30,000 additional ventilators to get through the mid-April peak of the outbreak. At that point, FEMA had sent New York 400.

Trump expressed skepticism at Cuomo’s figures even as his administration rushed to send New York 4,000 additional ventilators — about one-quarter of the nation’s entire emergency stockpile. Still, Cuomo pleaded for more.

“You pick the 26,000 people who are going to die,” Cuomo said at a news conference,

It wasn’t just New York, however. Similarly dire projections of a ventilator shortfall were also then circulating within the White House.

“The scariest day of my life was about a month ago when, after a long day of meetings, my team told me that we were going to be needing 130,000 ventilators; that we were short hundreds of thousands of ventilators,” Trump recounted in an April 14 briefing. “I had governors requesting unreasonable sums that the federal government just didn’t have.”

By late March, a bipartisan chorus of state governors and members of Congress were calling on the president to exercise his emergency authority under the Defense Production Act to force U.S. companies to produce ventilators.

Trump had resisted invoking the Korean War-era law, which grants the president sole authority to direct U.S. industrial production of critical supplies in times of national emergency, saying the private sector was stepping up production of ventilators and other medical supplies on its own.

But on March 27, Trump changed course, announcing that he would invoke the Defense Production Act to produce ventilators, which meant companies would have to give priority to federal orders over other customers.

“In the next 100 days — well, first of all, we’ve already delivered thousands of them — but within the next 100 days, we will either make or get, in some form, over 100,000 additional units,” Trump said.

By the start of April, FEMA officials confirmed to the House Oversight and Reform Committee that demand for ventilators would soon outpace the available supply. To ration what was left, FEMA Administrator Peter Gaynor directed that the remaining ventilators in the national stockpile be designated as a “strategic national asset” — to be provided to states only on a case-by-case basis where hospitals could demonstrate an “exigent need” to sustain life within 72 hours.

Federal purchasing records show that three months into the pandemic, HHS, which includes the Strategic National Stockpile, had not yet placed any orders for new ventilators in 2020.

That changed within three days of Trump’s March 27 edict, with HSS signing a $350 million deal with Zoll Medical Corp. Records show a flurry of about a dozen big orders with other ventilator makers over the next two weeks, most of them no-bid contracts exempted from the typical federal purchasing rules due to the national emergency.

In a typical year, U.S. companies produce about 29,000 ventilators, according to data cited by the White House. Though several domestic manufacturers had already announced they were adding extra shifts and hiring additional workers to ramp up production, AP’s analysis of HHS contracts show that even with the emergency no-bid orders the traditional medical device makers would deliver about 73,990 new ventilators by July 6 — the 100-day mark since Trump’s March 27 pledge.

It was clear additional industrial capacity would be needed to get 100,000 units by the president’s deadline.

General Motors, which had shut down auto production, had already entered into a partnership on March 20 with Ventec Life Systems, a small ventilator company, to simplify an off-the-shelf design for rapid production at GM’s Kokomo, Indiana, plant.

Though GM had announced it was “working night and day” to launch production, Trump accused CEO Mary Barra via Twitter of dragging her feet, and revived his long-running feud with the company over its 2019 closure of an Ohio factory that Trump had pledged to save.

“As usual with ‘this’ General Motors, things just never seem to work out,” Trump tweeted on March 27. “General Motors MUST immediately open their stupidly abandoned Lordstown plant in Ohio, or some other plant, and START MAKING VENTILATORS, NOW!!!!!!”

GM had sold the Lordstown factory in 2019.

The president also took aim at Ford Motor Co., tweeting that the rival automaker should also “GET GOING ON VENTILATORS, FAST!!!!!!”

On April 8, HHS announced it had reached a $489.4 million deal with GM to produce 30,000 ventilators by the end of August, with the first 6,132 delivered by June 1.

The following week, HHS announced a $336 million contract with Ford and General Electric, which teamed up to make 50,000 of GE Healthcare’s ventilators by July 13.

Assuming all the companies meet their deadlines, AP’s analysis shows the national stockpile should surpass 100,000 new ventilators by mid-July.

HHS declined to release to AP its contracts with ventilator producers without a Freedom of Information Act request, a legal process that can often take months or even years.

But AP’s analysis of the limited contract data available online and figures taken from HHS media releases shows the agency will spend more than $2.9 billion for 198,890 ventilators by the end of 2020, an average per-unit cost of $14,618.

Whether that’s a good deal for U.S. taxpayers is difficult to determine because medical device makers generally don’t publish their prices. HHS is buying at least 13 different models of ventilators from 10 different companies, all with different capabilities, features and accessories.

When AP sought details from HHS about the per-unit cost of four models from manufacturer Hamilton Medical, the agency’s press office provided figures that did not add up to the totals announced in earlier media releases. An HHS spokesperson said the previously provided figures were wrong and would be corrected on the agency’s website.

AP found several instances where the U.S. government had purchased the same models of ventilators before the pandemic. For example, contracting data does show that in December the Department of Defense bought a single, portable ventilator from Zoll Medical for $12,260.

Under its current contract with Zoll, HHS is purchasing 18,900 of the same model for slightly more than $350 million. That works out to about $18,500 each, which would be a more than 50 percent increase from what the Pentagon paid less than five months ago.

A HHS spokeswoman said Friday the government was paying about $12,100 for each ventilator, and that the additional money was for hoses, face masks and other related supplies needed to treat COVID-19 patients. The ventilators also came with a wheeled plastic case with power port, which cost an additional $722 each, according to HHS.

The Defense Department did not respond to questions Friday about whether its 2019 ventilator deliveries also included accessories.

Zoll’s top executive said his company’s pricing had remained consistent.

“Zoll is supplying the U.S. government with its requested products at our usual and customary government pricing, absorbing the additional costs associated with Zoll’s rapid increase in production capacity,” Zoll CEO Jonathan Rennert said Friday. “We are focused on fulfilling the government’s order on time and meeting this urgent public need.”

Erik Gordon, a business professor at the University of Michigan who studies the medical device industry, said ventilator companies are probably incurring increased costs as they ramp up production to meet high demand. Manufacturers haven’t had time to bulk buy additional parts and probably had to add workers to make more of the machines, he said.

U.S. ventilator makers have raised production from a rate of about 700 per week in February to about 5,000 per week by early April, according to the Advanced Medical Technology Association, an industry trade group.

“If you don’t have time to change your manufacturing processes to get those economies of scale, you get there by brute force, extra labor,” said Gordon, who teaches a course in monetizing medical device ideas. “Your costs actually go up, not down.”

With the federal government buying most of the new ventilators being made in the U.S., state governments and hospital systems urgently seeking the machines have often been forced to go through middlemen or foreign suppliers.

Cuomo has compared the free-for-all bidding to going on eBay, and said during a March 31 briefing that New York had ordered 17,000 ventilators from China for $25,000 each.

“We are paying $25,000 per ventilator, and we are broke,” Cuomo said. “The last thing I want to do is buy a single ventilator I don’t need.”

More than a month later, only 2,500 of the Chinese machines have been delivered, according to Cuomo’s office. In a separate case, New York officials are trying to recover another $69.1 million paid to a Silicon Valley electrical engineer who promised 1,450 ventilators that never materialized.

With nearly 200,000 new ventilators set for delivery to the federal stockpile by the end of the year, Trump is declaring victory. But it is now unclear whether the stockpile of new ventilators will be needed.

In the little more than a month since Trump announced the buying spree, a series of medical studies has spurred questions about whether ventilators are effective at saving the lives of critically ill COVID-19 patients.

A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine on March 30 found that only 1 of 7 patients older than 70 who were put on a ventilator survived. For patients younger than 70, just 36% lived.

In New York City, state officials say 80% or more of coronavirus patients placed on the machines died.

The studies have caused doctors to reevaluate the use of ventilators in favor of less intensive forms of respiratory support.

Trump administration officials say the new ventilators could still prove valuable if the virus outbreak were to intensify into a second wave after the warm summer months.

“It’s very important that we have a completely refreshed and a comprehensive stockpile going into the fall,” Dr. Deborah Birx, a medical adviser on the White House Coronavirus Task Force, said at a briefing on April 21. “I think that’s why we’ve continued to bring in those shipments and work on the ventilators so that those would be available not only for the United States but certainly if other partner countries have this level of tragedy.”

Trump said he intends to ship thousands of the breathing machines overseas, where the needs are greater.

On Tuesday, Mexico said it received a shipment of ventilators from the United States. Trump said last week Russia is also set to receive U.S. ventilators, along with other countries.

“People dying because they don’t have ventilators, and they’re not equipped to do what we did,” Trump said Friday. “So we’re giving thousands and thousands of these ventilators away to many countries that have suffered greatly: Italy, France, Spain, so many countries. And Nigeria called. Tremendous problems in Nigeria. Tremendous problems all over. And so they’re very happy.”

This briefing is no longer updating. Read the latest developments in the coronavirus outbreak here.
California and Texas received the most small-business relief funds.
Money from the Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program, which ran out of funds on Thursday, flowed heavily to California and Texas, with construction companies and manufacturers getting the largest number of loans, rather than harder-hit retailers and restaurants, according to new data.
The nearly $350 billion in the Paycheck Protection Program also disproportionately flowed to states that have suffered fewer infections and deaths under the virus, like Kansas, than to harder-hit states like New York and New Jersey, when adjusting for the size of the small-business economy in each state.
The new data, which include loan approvals through Thursday, show accommodation and food service firms have received less than 9 percent of the money from the program, about $30.5 billion, though they have suffered the largest job losses of any industry during this recession. Construction firms received the largest share, at just over 13 percent, or about $45 billion.
Adjusting for the total amount of money that small businesses pay their employees and would be eligible to receive in loans to cover payroll, the Great Plains states emerge as big winners, with Nebraska, Kansas and the Dakotas receiving disproportionate shares of the money. By that metric, Nebraska did twice as well as New York.
The S.B.A. program was intended for banks to distribute the loans, which the federal government will pay off in most cases. That structure benefited companies with existing relationships with banks.
S.B.A. officials included data on the largest lending institutions in the program, though they were not identified. The top lender distributed more than $14 million in loans with an average size of more than $500,000 per loan — suggesting that the institution was giving loans to relatively large businesses.
Stocks jump as investors rally behind the idea of reopening the economy.
Stocks in the United States rallied on Friday, with efforts to reopen the economy taking center stage and investors undeterred by more data showing the economic damage of the coronavirus pandemic.
The gains came after President Trump told governors on Thursday that they could begin reopening businesses in their states by May 1 or earlier, and Boeing — one of the nation’s largest manufacturers — said it planned to bring about 27,000 employees back to work in Washington State to resume aircraft production.
The announcement is the first attempt at large-scale resumption of business activity by a U.S. corporation since the coronavirus outbreak forced companies and government officials to shut down most nonessential work. Boeing’s shares rose more than 14 percent on Friday.
Some European automakers — including Volkswagen, Volvo and Daimler — are planning to restart assembly lines next week, staffed by workers in masks and protective clothing, sometimes separated from one another by plastic screens.
Opel, a unit of the French automaker PSA, said it would reopen its German dealerships on Monday after the German government announced that it would gradually ease lockdown restrictions.
The S&P 500 rose 2.7 percent, while Boeing’s gains led the Dow Jones industrial average to a 3 percent jump.
After global stock markets nose-dived earlier this year, they have been rebounding since late March, as investors have routinely looked past evidence of the damage caused by stay-at-home orders and business shutdowns, and instead focused on hopes for an eventual recovery. The gains on Friday mean stocks ended the week higher, despite reports showing a historic plunge in retail sales and a continued surge in unemployment claims.
The S&P 500 is now up more than 28 percent from its lowest point this year, which was reached on March 23. It is still nearly 18 percent below its high in late February.
On Friday, the rally came after China reported that its economy — the world’s second-largest after that of the United States — shrank for the first time in decades. And data on car sales in Europe showed they collapsed.
Some also saw hopeful signs in a report by the medical news website STAT that a drug from Gilead Sciences showed early — and, thus far, unproven — promise in fighting the coronavirus. According to STAT, the antiviral drug, remdesivir, has helped patients with severe symptoms recover rapidly in a clinical trial at a Chicago hospital. Gilead’s shares jumped nearly 10 percent.
The Trump administration plans to funnel $19 billion to farmers.President Trump said Friday he would channel $19 billion to American farmers and ranchers that have been hurt by the fallout from coronavirus, payments that come on top of tens of billions of dollars of assistance given to farmers in the last year to offset the pain of the trade war with China.
The Trump administration will make $16 billion in direct payments to farmers who have experienced losses from coronavirus, Mr. Trump said in a briefing Friday evening. It would also purchase a further $3 billion of fresh produce, dairy and meat that will be distributed through food banks and other community and faith organizations to people in need, he added.
“These are great people, great Americans,” Mr. Trump said. “It is money well deserved. Not only were they targeted at one point by China, that was over a period of time, and they never complained.”
Over the past year, the Trump administration has extended $28 billion to American farmers and ranchers to help offset the pain of a trade war with China. Mr. Trump ratcheted up tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of Chinese products in an effort to reach a trade deal, prompting China to respond with tariffs on American soybeans, pork, dairy and other products that crippled sales to one of the world’s largest markets.
More news media outlets lay off workers.
The news media industry continues to be shellacked by the dismal advertising market as businesses remain shuttered throughout much of the country. The New York Times now estimates that approximately 33,000 workers in the media industry have been affected by planned layoffs, pay cuts and furloughs, up from 28,000 last week.
The magazine company Condé Nast announced on Monday that it was cutting the pay of nearly half its work force by 10 to 20 percent. The newspaper chain Advance Local — which shares a corporate parent with Condé — said this week that it would furlough employees for one to two weeks.
Digital sites, whose subscription businesses are often immature or nonexistent, continue to impose cost-savings as a way to stanch the bleeding in the ad market. Slate, which converted its membership program, Slate Plus, into a paywall last month, is cutting all employees’ pay on a sliding scale. Vox Media, which purchased New York Media last year, is furloughing roughly 10 percent of its work force and cutting the pay of high-earning employees.
The Los Angeles Times, one of the country’s largest newspapers by circulation, announced internally this week that it was furloughing 40 non-newsroom workers and cutting senior managers’ pay. It also shuttered three community weeklies, laying off 14 people, including guild members.
The ride-sharing business has collapsed.
In February, Uber said it had expected to bring in $16 billion to $17 billion in revenue this year. On Thursday, the company said it could no longer forecast what will happen.
Lyft has not yet made a similar announcement, but there’s no reason to think it faces a different fate.
Drawing from aggregated debit and credit card purchases of millions of U.S. consumers, for example, the analytics firm Second Measure found that spending on Uber’s rides dropped about 83 percent in March. And earnings tracker service Gridwise, using data collected from more than 30,000 drivers nationwide, found that the average hourly earnings of drivers dropped 36 percent from the beginning of March to the middle of the month. By the end of March, wages began to recover slightly, but were still down 24 percent.
So how are the companies dealing with the slump? For now, the strategy appears to be: Wait it out, and deliver food — as much of it as possible.
Uber’s money-losing food delivery service, Uber Eats, most likely surpassed Uber’s ride-hailing business in sales by mid-March and jumped about 27 percent for the month, according to Second Measure.
Although Lyft had no food delivery business before the pandemic, it created a temporary one to deliver meals and groceries for students and seniors. And on Wednesday, Lyft expanded the program to 11 major cities, including Atlanta, Houston, San Francisco and Seattle.
What to know about the proliferation of frauds around the coronavirus.
Frauds around the coronavirus include businesses selling intravenous vitamin C drips to “boost immunity” to the virus, websites offering masks that never arrive and even reports of fake drive-up testing sites, where impostors swabbed people’s cheeks in exchange for cash.
Here are some questions and answers about coronavirus-related fraud:How can I protect myself from coronavirus fraud?First, understand that there are currently no F.D.A.-approved vaccines or treatments for the coronavirus, said Noah Joshua Phillips, an F.T.C. commissioner. That will, hopefully, change — but you are unlikely to hear about it first via a shady robocall. The best thing to do if you get a suspicious call is to hang up, he said.
What if I am expecting a government stimulus payment?Most people don’t have to do anything to get their economic stimulus payments, which the government is issuing to help people facing money troubles because of the virus. Those payments will be deposited into your bank account automatically, the I.R.S. said.
“The I.R.S. isn’t going to call you asking to verify or provide your financial information” so you can get your payment faster, the head of the agency, Chuck Rettig, said in a statement this month.
I saw a social media report about virus-related fraud occurring door to door. Is this true?Agencies including the F.B.I. have issued public warnings about people selling fake virus test kits and “unapproved treatments” on “door-to-door visits.” The inspector general for the Department of Health and Human Services also warned of “scammers” going door to door offering Covid-19 tests in exchange for personal details, like Medicare information.
European car sales plummeted in March.
New data on Friday gave the first concrete indication of how severely European carmakers were hit by coronavirus lockdowns, and it was every bit as bad as feared.
New car registrations in the European Union fell 55 percent last month compared with a year earlier, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association said, as dealers closed their doors and buyers were stuck in their homes. Owners registered 570,000 new cars during the month, down from 1.3 million in March 2019.
Sales all but evaporated in Italy, the European country that went into lockdown the earliest, falling 85 percent. Spain and France also suffered declines of around 70 percent.
Carmakers that depend on southern Europe for sales also suffered the most. Fiat Chrysler sales plummeted 77 percent. PSA, whose brands include Peugeot, Citroën and Opel, suffered a 68 percent plunge in sales.
German carmakers BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen fared marginally better, with declines of less than 50 percent.
Catch up: Here’s what else is happening.Boeing will resume operations on Monday in the Philadelphia area, where it produces military aircraft such as the H-47 Chinook and V-22 Osprey. The work had been suspended for two weeks on April 3. On Thursday, Boeing said it planned to bring back 27,000 workers next week to facilities in Washington State to work on commercial aircraft production.Walmart said that it had hired 150,000 workers since March 19, and it pledged to hire 50,000 more. The retailer said it had received more than a million applications since its initial hiring announcement. The new workers will be hired on a temporary basis, it said, adding that many had been furloughed from other companies and were looking to bridge the gap until they returned to their original jobs.The organizers behind San Diego Comic Con, the annual pop culture celebration, announced on Friday that the event was canceled, the first time in its 50-year history. Fans who purchased badges can request a refund or transfer their badges to next year’s event.Ford Motor said it expected to report a $2 billion loss for the first quarter, on revenue of $34 billion. The announcement came in a regulatory filing ahead of a full quarterly report on April 28. The automaker said earlier this week that its first-quarter wholesale volume was down 21 percent from a year earlier, mainly because of the outbreak’s impact on production and demand. It said last month that it was suspending its dividend and any share buybacks.General Electric’s aviation leasing division said it was canceling 69 orders for Boeing’s troubled 737 Max jet, which has been grounded for over a year after two fatal crashes. Boeing received 150 Max order cancellations last month. In the first quarter, it took in four times as many order cancellations as new orders.Procter & Gamble, the consumer products giant, reported a big jump in sales for the quarter as consumers stocked up on paper towels, toilet paper and diapers. P&G reported that organic net sales rose five percent to $17.2 billion. The company said increased shipments in North America and some parts of Europe offset declines in some Asian markets.The coronavirus outbreak has brought China’s extraordinary, nearly half-century-long run of growth to an end. The country’s National Bureau of Statistics said on Friday that the economic output shrank 6.8 percent from January through March compared to the same period last year. It’s the first economic shrinkage acknowledged in official statistics since 1976, when the country was in the final days of the Cultural Revolution.Reporting was contributed by Daisuke Wakabayashi, Davey Alba, Gina Kolata, Jack Ewing, Abdi Latif Dahir, Simon Marks, Karen Weise, Julie Creswell, Marc Tracy, Elaine Yu, Kevin McKenna, Nelson D.

Boulder, Colorado, which offered so much when my parents retired there, geez, more than 30 years ago, isn’t quite the jubilee it was. Now in their mid-80s, they aren’t charging up the trail to Wonderland Lake anymore.

It can be a frustrating conversation. Particularly when my mother is planning to go to the store. “Ma!” I’ll say. “Don’t risk your life for coconut shrimp!” Or, when that doesn’t work, “Ma! You’re going to die alone, surrounded by strangers in masks.”

Opinion

My father is sometimes watching television when I phone — CNN, thank God, not Fox — and my mother will mention something on the screen, the latest aftershock from our president’s daily twirl in the limelight, like some demented ballerina on the music box in an insecure girl’s nightmare.

“Don’t watch TV news, Mom,” I’ll say. “I never do.”

That’s true. Primarily because I read newspapers and follow events online, so anything on TV is repetitive. Even big breaking stories — the last time I fled to TV news was when Notre Dame burned. After 10 minutes of time-filling and tap-dancing, I bailed. What’s the point? As for the president’s daily 5 p.m. nervous breakdown ... “Fortunate the person,” Soren Kierkegaard writes, “who did not need to travel to hell in order to see what the devil looks like.”

People who do make that journey, the daily descent, feel obligated to react. This has gone on years, and I’m sorry, but by now those doing so seem merely slow on the uptake. “What? You’re saying that the president is lying?!? Oh, my gosh, that’s awful! When did he start doing that?”

And yet. Sometimes, you must join in. State the obvious. For The Record. Yes, there is something OCD about keeping track of the president’s lies. Maybe it’s like baseball; to ignore even one wild pitch is to lose the fabric of the game. I understand that. Was that a strike or a ball? Hard to determine the next day. You have to pay attention now. Though I bet journalists wish they had decided to keep track of his true statements — a much shorter list.

To the matter at hand.

On Monday, he — no need to speak the name — tweeted this:

“In light of the attack from the Invisible Enemy, as well as the need to protect the jobs of our GREAT American Citizens. I will be signing an Executive Order to temporarily suspend immigration into the United States!”

“The Invisible Enemy.” He means the virus, right? Though you can’t be certain, can you?

Three of my four grandparents were immigrants. Maybe yours, too. If they weren’t, then somebody further down the line was. And when those people came over, be they Jewish or Italian, South American or Somalian, you know the riffraff on the pier fancied themselves as better, smarter, worthier, real Americans, because they were here already.

The old lie. His ace reliever. The horse he rode in on: “They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists.” His “Look! A squirrel!” fastball. The dogs always go for it, swinging at the heels. Whenever the president has made a botch job of something — and, man, is this a botch — he winds up, lets loose “build the wall” and his followers rush off, tongues lolling.

The good news is his bad idea immediately got watered down, as it often does. By Wednesday, it was nearly meaningless, just another unwelcome fumble at Lady Liberty’s crotch. By Friday, it’ll be nearly forgotten, replaced by a dozen other doozies and head-scratchers, contradictions, excesses, whoppers and jaw-droppers.

I’m not saying ignore the news. With 45,000 Americans dead since Valentine’s Day, and another 45,000 to die, easy, by Fourth of July, that would be irresponsible.

But I recommend a conscious program of distraction. Take your news, then take a break. Wednesday, I got my hands on an advance copy of an upcoming book about Jeanne Gang, the rock star Chicago architect, and her Studio Gang. I immediately began reading — to give you a full accounting before its publication date in June, but also to go somewhere else for a little while. This year, 2020, will always be the year of COVID-19. But 2020 will also be the year Gang’s 101-story Vista Tower opens. Cold comfort, but comfort nonetheless.",real

The total cases include staff at district-run or charter schools or who work for outside vendors.

The district didn’t identify the two workers who passed away or say which jobs they held at which schools. Officials only said neither had recently been to a school building.

“With widespread community transmission in Chicago, the district’s number one priority has been keeping staff safe and healthy and our thoughts are with all members of the CPS community who have been impacted by this virus,” CPS spokeswoman Emily Bolton said in a statement.

All schools in Illinois have been closed since March 17 through an order by Gov. J.B. Pritzker. But hundreds of CPS schools have operated as food and laptop distribution centers during that time, with lunchroom workers passing out more than 10 million meals and administrators handing out 102,000 digital devices.

Of the 85 known cases, 38 are “essential employees” who were at a school at least once in recent weeks. The food and computer distribution programs at those schools were paused once the district was notified of the positive tests.

For the 38 cases that caused the temporary closures, signs were hung up on the front entrance of the buildings — but CPS didn’t send email notifications to parents, teachers or students at those schools. Officials also haven’t released a list of the schools.

The district at the end of March stopped notifying communities if someone at their school tested positive for the coronavirus. CPS officials pointed to the fact that, at that point, schools had been closed for two weeks — equal to the 14-day incubation period for the virus — and any new positive tests at that point would not have been contracted by in anyone in the building when schools were open.

The true impact on CPS’ 38,700 workers is undoubtedly much larger than currently known as Chicago reached 26,606 cases Tuesday with 1,068 deaths. As is generally the case, experts strongly suspect many more cases have gone unidentified in people who have recovered at home without being tested.",real

(Reuters) - Kohl’s Corp (KSS.N) reported a bigger-than-expected loss on Tuesday, as the department store chain’s stores remained shut for most of the first quarter due to the COVID-19 lockdowns.

The company had earlier withdrawn its full-year forecast, suspended share buyback plan and borrowed money to combat the pandemic’s impact. The company said it ended the quarter with $2 billion in cash at hand.

The results come at a time peers when J.Crew, Neiman Marcus and J.C. Penney (JCP.N) have filed for bankruptcy protection due to huge losses.

Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin-based Kohl’s was forced to close all its stores in the United States to curb the spread of the coronavirus. The company is now reopening some stores across the country, while online operations remain open.

Chief Executive Officer Michelle Gass said the company has reopened about 50% of its U.S. stores.

Kohl’s said net sales fell to $2.16 billion from $3.82 billion a year earlier.

For the quarter ended May 2, the company reported net loss of $541 million, or $3.50 per share, compared with a profit of $62 million, or 38 cents per share, a year earlier.

Excluding one-time items, it lost $3.20 per share, missing Wall Street estimates of a $1.80 loss, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.",real

A yellowish-gray substance wrapped in a chilled tortilla with a side of mashed strawberries and blueberries arrived around noon on Monday.

“Surprise, Daddy! We brought you lunch,” said Matteo, my 2-year-old, beaming along with his older brother, Lucca, in the doorway to my makeshift home office.

My wife had given our children strict instructions not to disturb Daddy, and, mostly, they had complied. Sure, there were the occasional high-pitched shrieks and the wallop of what sounded like the armoire tipping over and slamming onto the ceiling above me — not to mention the “Ont some waffles!” cry from Matteo every couple of hours or so.

But after heapings of coronavirus gloom from the morning news, my children’s scrambled egg offering brought more comfort than a plate of my favorite spaghetti carbonara.

I’ve never worked from home before. I’m on Day 3 and can’t imagine this isolation lasting for another two, three, four — goodness knows how many more weeks.

But we can’t really shut out the outside world. Beside the barrage of bad news — including mounting coronavirus cases in Italy, my father’s home — my wife and I worry that Matteo, who is asthmatic, might need a trip to the emergency room, as he has a dozen or so times since his birth. I’m not a particularly religious man, but I’ve prayed about that in recent days.

But like everyone else, we are adjusting to this new reality.

I’m struck by how quiet it is in the mornings — before my children awaken. Quiet enough to hear chattering sparrows and the bird song that cuts through all of that, the whit-choo, whit-choo, whit-choo! of the northern Cardinal. Signs, too, that spring is not so far off.

This morning, we were greeted by the smiling, bearded face of “Mr. Muhammad,” Matteo’s Montessori music teacher, who could be seen on my phone strumming his guitar all alone in the school’s music room. Typically, he’s accompanied by a dozen or so bouncing toddlers, including Matteo. The day before, he’d offered a yoga class as a way to help all of us to calm down a little bit.

“Can I listen to Mr. Hammad?” Matteo said, noticing the video on my phone.

Then, not fully grasping the reality of the situation, he said, “Where’s Matteo? Where’s Logan?”

Mr. Muhammad is nothing short of a rock star in our family — a guy who will only become more revered as this thing drags on.

It’s been harder to gauge how Lucca, my 8-year-old, is doing. Not long ago, he declared, “Children are dying from the coronavirus.”

He has stopped talking about the disease in recent days. And when I sat him down and asked if he’s still worried, he assured me that he isn’t.

But it’s hard to say what’s going on in that Pokemon-obsessed head of his. At times, he’s refused to sleep in the bunk bed he’d begged us for months to buy. The other day, I found him curled up asleep on the floor in his bedroom. And Lucca, like Matteo, is more insistent than ever that I read him a bedtime story every night.

On Tuesday, Lucca brought me “lunch” — two pieces of bread that appeared to have leaped out of the toaster in fear of being browned. Lucca had smeared peanut butter on one slice and made a strawberry jam smiley face on the other.

To cool the cabin fever, I announced we were going to have a backyard baseball game on my lunch break — never mind that Dad, who grew up in England, doesn’t actually know the rules of baseball. About 10 minutes later, Matteo arrived at my office door in a shirt and, from the waist down, nothing but his birthday suit.

“I want to go out and play baseball!” he shouted.

His mother, with one arched eyebrow, followed close behind holding a diaper and questioning the timing of my announcement.

“Daddy shouldn’t have brought it up now,” she said.

So we are all adjusting. What choice do we have?

With social distancing guidelines possibly curtailing in-person voting at the polls in November, states are drawing up plans to rely more heavily on a mail-in system that has until now seen only limited use.

Get the latest news about the coronavirus and its ripple effects in Chicago and Illinois in our live blog.

Historically, there is no evidence of widespread voter fraud through mail-in voting. But social media users are already pushing grandiose theories casting doubt on the method. President Donald Trump has encouraged the skepticism, saying during a televised briefing that “a lot of people cheat with mail-in voting.” On Saturday, he tweeted: “Don’t allow RIGGED ELECTIONS!”

Justice Department officials are concerned foreign adversaries could exploit any vulnerabilities in the vote-by-mail process, especially since even minor tampering could trigger widespread doubts about the integrity of the vote.

“Is it possible, in particular for a foreign actor, to cause enough mischief in the vote-by-mail process to raise a question in the minds of Americans, particularly Americans perhaps whose candidate has lost, that somehow the result of this election is unfair?” Assistant Attorney General John Demers, the department’s top national security official, said in describing a key question confronting law enforcement.

Several disinformation experts said they have not found evidence yet that foreign actors are covertly pushing a false narrative about mail-in voting.

But a sham social media campaign that feeds existing doubts about the U.S. election process would align with the Kremlin’s playbook, said Bret Schafer, a media and digital disinformation fellow at the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a Washington think tank. During the 2016 election, Russia-linked groups polluted American voters’ social media feeds with messages about hot-button topics like race relations, gun laws and immigration.

“You don’t have to hack the vote to hack people’s perception of the vulnerability of the vote,” he said. “All you need to do is to seed enough doubt about the legitimacy of a vote.”

Well before the coronavirus upended America’s electoral process, federal officials were girding for the prospect of foreign interference in the U.S. election. The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security warned in February that Russia could seek to misuse voter registration data and even secretly advise campaigns or candidates, according to documents The Associated Press obtained.

Now, a potential overhaul of how millions of Americans vote could present new vulnerabilities for foreign adversaries to weaponize.

Only five states currently conduct mail-in voting, where a ballot is automatically mailed to every eligible voter.

The remaining states have substantial work in the months ahead. They will have to make major changes to their voting and tabulating systems, buy equipment or software to track the ballots and sort out who — individual voters or taxpayers — will pay for return postage in less than six months’ time to accommodate more voting by mail.

Some states are exploring how to simply expand existing absentee voting systems, in which voters can request a ballot.

“Just like you wouldn’t want to premiere your play straight to Broadway, it’s hard to have a very new or very changed system in a high-stakes presidential election, especially under conditions where normal meetings, trainings, might be impacted by the pandemic,” said Richard Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California, Irvine.

Those last-minute changes could spur unsubstantiated claims about rampant voter fraud, an unsupported theory that Trump and some of his supporters have already pushed for years.

Russian state media have already questioned states’ attempts to postpone primaries or transition them to a mail-in process as governors grapple with how to hold an election against the backdrop of the virus.

“Coronavirus is coming, hide the ballots! Calls to cancel campaigns & voting erode already-thin trust in US primaries,” read a headline on the website of the Russian television channel RT, which broadcasts in English and is aimed at audiences outside Russia.

Meanwhile, conspiracy theories that Democrats are hyping the pandemic to push for mail-in voting or that forecasts of a second wave this fall are part of a ploy to cancel an in-person vote have received thousands of likes, retweets and shares on Facebook, Twitter and Reddit. The theories are popular in dozens of Facebook groups that have been created in recent weeks to protest governors’ stay-at-home orders.

“When you have this ambiguity and uncertainty, that’s fertile ground for pushing out false information,” said Schafer, the think tank fellow. “This is creating a perfect environment for these narratives to thrive.”

Negative chatter around mail-in ballots spiked in those Facebook groups after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi proposed expanding early voting and mail-in voting last month, said Madelyn Webb, a research reporter for First Draft, an organization that tracks disinformation.

One popular meme accused Democrats of extending the quarantine to push “mail in ballots so they can cheat.” The image received a combined 90,000 likes, comments and shares, mostly on pro-Trump and conservative Facebook pages.

And for under $100, the Alaska Republican Party took out a Facebook ad that said: “Democrats are using the coronavirus pandemic to gut election fraud protections. Don’t let them. Add your name to our petition to STOP BALLOT HARVESTING!” Facebook said the ad, which is still running, does not violate its policies.

Meanwhile, liberal social media users are pushing mail-in voting as a surefire option, glossing over some of the challenges such drastic changes to the voting system will present.

Facebook groups like Occupy Democrats and Being Liberal widely circulated an article promoting vote by mail, saying it has a history of success because the U.S. military has used the method for decades.",real

Special for USA TODAY

“One Morgan” is a saying among the approximately 20,000 people in Georgia’s Morgan County. But a county that preaches such a unified message is now as spread apart as ever, just like countless counties, cities and towns across the United States.

And like their peers around the country, seniors at Morgan County High have been deprived of prom, graduation and the last day of high school, not to mention their final sports seasons.

Coaches and administrators at the school demonstrated what it means to be “One Morgan” by delivering a personalized yard sign to all their seniors on the day it was announced spring sports were canceled. Baseball coach Merritt Ainslie even helped wrangle some cows that got loose from one family's pasture during a delivery.

“You would have thought I was giving them a million dollars,” tennis coach Stacy Manger said of the yard signs, which went to all seniors but were delivered by spring coaches to their seniors. “It was like we were coming home from World War II. It was just an incredible feeling and one I will never forget.”

In order to gauge the impact of coronavirus on athletes and coaches at one high school, sports journalism students from the University of Georgia spoke in April with members of the Morgan County community. These are their stories:

Comforting athletes

Manger walks her dogs past a collection of desolate tennis courts every day. She gazes at them, wishing she could still be with her players.

Manger, a former college athlete and now a licensed professional counselor, sympathizes with her “second family.”

“I’m thanking God that I got the degree I did because it’s helped me to not only be a better coach, but be able to help others,” said Manger.

Senior Sara Moore’s relationship with Manger has helped her put the sudden and cruel cancellation of her last high school tennis season behind her.

“She’s like a second mom to me,” Moore said. “She’s always there for us.”

High school coaches everywhere have a new task: comforting their athletes, especially the seniors.

Girls soccer coach Anne Stamps is navigating her way through “what feels like a grieving process.” In an attempt to bond with her players, Stamps wrote each of them a letter and sent those with a team picture “as something to bring us together.”

Stamps’ son Ethan also had his senior baseball season taken from him.

“I see it as a mom of a senior and then as a coach of seniors,” she said. “So I kind of know the face they put on for the public but I see them at home, and they’re really bummed out. No matter if they’re telling me they’re OK, I can tell if they’re really not because I see it at my own house. I think that’s helped me reach out to these seniors.”

Morgan County High had an enrollment of 939 students as of last October. Approximately 450 of them participated in one or more sanctioned athletic activity.

Unanswered questions

Seth Robertson and his teammates had already run a school record-setting 4x100-meter relay this season. He made no qualms about his expectations: the Bulldogs’ first state championship in the event.

“It was devastating, for sure, just knowing that we could never finish,” said Robertson, a football standout committed to Georgia Southern who also played on the Morgan County baseball team. “It’s always going to be that not knowing that we could go on to the state level and show what we had.”

For the senior athletes of Morgan County, like thousands of others across the country, the premature end to their seasons left many unanswered questions – on the field and in their relationships.

Haylee Patterson and her golf teammates were playing in their first tournament of the season when they realized the impact that coronavirus would have on the remainder of the schedule. Patterson was looking forward to helping rebuild a young team with fellow senior Maitlin Stapp.

“We loved playing with each other,” Patterson said. “We had made a really good friendship the last two years. It’s been really tough on us.”

Although Patterson takes solace in being able to golf later in life, drifting away from her friends is not the storybook ending she dreamed for her high school career.

“I think we’re really missing out on our final goodbyes,” Patterson said. “It just felt like it was taken so fast.”

Patterson and Robertson stay in touch with former teammates and work out in their backyards to maintain semblances of bygone routines. While Robertson stays fit in hopes of going to Statesboro in June for orientation and summer camp, the possibility of no college football this fall weighs heavily on him.

“That’s heartbreaking,” Robertson said. “I just hope that I can go out there on Saturday and play ball really.”

Pondering football

Doug Connelly, Morgan County’s athletic director, strives to mimic the normal work day, getting to his desk by 8 a.m., in his red M-lettered ball cap.

That desk, however, normally serves as his family’s dining room table. And instead of having it to himself, it's a multi-purpose workstation. His wife, Ivey Connelly, is a teacher. Their three children -- Trace, 10; Lila Mae, 7, and Tucker 5 – are students. They all use the same space.

He works on projects (notably a revised athletic handbook) and communicates with coaches virtually. He has the freedom of an extra hour’s sleep. But something feels off. Connelly yearns for daily handshake greetings with colleagues.

""Nothing is typical any more,"" Connelly said. ""This is all so new.""

A cloud of uncertainty looms over Connelly, too. With sports grounded, there's no plan for when, or if, football season — the main money maker — will begin.

Connelly has no concerns for lost spring-sport gate revenues. The cancellation of championships, and the travel expenses that saves, serves as a financial ""wash,"" he said. The county’s board of education also provides funding.

The issue lies with the uncertainty of football season and sponsorships. Connelly had designed a branding-display package for businesses. Some scheduled quarterly or bi-annual payments, and one is due in June. Connelly is debating whether to delay or cancel the collection.

""It's very important for us and helps run our teams,"" Connelly said. ""It's a huge concern as to whether they'll renew sponsorship.""

Everybody knows each other in Madison, so Connelly is extra aware of the burdens small businesses face. He’s trying to keep his programs afloat while not putting his neighbors in a position to sink.

Connelly struggles to find a solution. One that might not come until he’s back at his school office.

""When we do have our first football game, I feel confident that people will support,"" principal Miki Edwards said.

Chasing dad

Ethan Stamps needed eight home runs to break his father’s school career record of 32. Stamps hit five in the last two series the Bulldogs played.

“Every time I hit a home run, I looked at my dad, and we laughed at each other, because he was getting worried I was actually going to beat the record,” Ethan Stamps said.

Crandall Stamps graduated in 1988.

The younger Stamps will play baseball at Lipscomb University in Tennessee next season. His goals for this last high school season were to hit the ball hard and get on base, he said, but the thought of beating his dad’s record constantly ran through his mind.

“By him getting closer and closer with the home runs he hit, it gave him more drive and focus to keep working hard,” Crandall Stamps said. “It would have meant a lot to him.”

Not being able to beat the record was tough, Ethan Stamps said, but losing his final season with his teammates after a good start in region play was tougher.

Ainslie, the coach, said he hopes to get the whole team together over the summer to play one last game.

“When we are done with the shutdown, we would like to have a senior night and a banquet and a final intrasquad game, so they can have some memories of going out on the field one last time."" Ainslie said. ""We all need that.”

Recalling 9/11

Bill Malone has thought about 9/11 often in recent weeks. The Morgan County football coach for 26 years sees a lot of similarities in his community between then and now: fear, tragedy, uncertainty.

Back then, though, the time it took to return to normality was shorter.

“During 9/11, we canceled football games for that week,” Malone said. “But, by God, we knew we’d be out there next week.”

Things are different from 9/11, and by a wide margin. The rallying cry following the terrorist attacks for a small-town community gathering at a high school sports event can’t be replicated in a time of social distancing. For each day that rally doesn’t come, anxieties in Morgan County grow.

“This has been like a bulldozer to us,” Malone said. “This thing is just continuing to pile up and pile up and pile up, and we don’t know when it’s going to stop.”

You can hear the impact of COVID-19 shutdowns in people’s voices in Madison. Malone can also see it in the town square. What used to be a gathering place is now a ghost town.

“I have a very big concern for small businesses,” Malone said. “You go to the post office and that's about the only place you can go to in the town square.”

Football season serves as a beacon of hope here that can bring pride and joy back to the community. Now, a fall football season is in question, and hope dwindles as uncertainty grows.

“This is when we’re really starting to gear up,” Malone said. “There’s usually motivation that the season is right around the corner. Right now, we’re missing that.”",real

A new bill has been introduced into the 116th Congress (2019-2020) of the U.S. House of Representatives named H.R.6666 - COVID-19 Testing, Reaching, And Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act, with the potential to further the loss of the already vanishing health freedoms of each and every citizen of the United States. You can stand with us today by opposing H.R.6666 now (use this link to Take A Stand)

H.R. 6666, despite having been introduced by Rep. Bobby L. Rush [D-IL-1] and referred to the Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on the same day almost two weeks ago on 5/01/2020, has received little mainstream media coverage to this date, other than recent attempts to debunk claims that it would further violate the rights of Americans. As of 5/14/2020 is has 59 co-sponsors, including one Republican, indicating the potential that it may gain greater bipartisan support unless strongly opposed.

H.R. 6666 authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Director of the CDC, to allocate a 100 billion dollars, annually (or until the national COVID emergency is declared over), to employ, train, and deploy an immense workforce of “testing and contact tracers” to be sent directly to everyone’s homes for diagnostic testing and tracing of contacts suspected to have been infected or are at risk of infection with COVID-19. The bill uses broad yet highly vague language to describe the role of this veritable army of new agents of the emerging U.S. medical police state “for other purposes,” such as “support the quarantine of such contacts.”

The nebulous language of H.R. 6666 affords the government and public and private grantees under its coordination unusually broad discretion to apply its newly granted police powers under the presently defined “national COVID health emergency.” Since the national lockdown began on March the 15th, we’ve witnessed the near complete suspension of most of our Constitutionally irrevocable civil liberties, with the near complete cessation and/or modification of all socio-economic activity within the country. Moreover, executive orders have already been enacted throughout this country enabling the forced seizure of body tissue and fluids, property, forced vaccination, testing, isolation, quarantine and arrest without due process. While not all of these draconian regulations have yet been implemented en masse, they exist in the letter of the law and therefore could be enforced, especially given that bills such as H.R.6666 use broad discretionary language leaving it to the government to intepret its meaning and apply force as it sees fit. If H.R. 6666 passes, real ""teeth"" would be put to many of the laws, acts, orders, and regulations that have been passed as executive orders over the past two months, potentially locking the entire country into an irreversible control grid the likes of which we have not seen outside of countries like China.

In light of this, H.R. 6666 may be setting the stage for the implementation of what WHO director Dr. Mike Ryan of the WHO and Ventura County California officials, say will include forcibly removing family members found positive or suspected of being infected. The only way to prevent this is to make sure the bill is opposed and dies.

Eligible recipients of funds include “faith-based” and “school-based” institutions, implying that these organizations might also become, in part, testing or treatment centers.

What is Contract Tracing?

Take a few minutes to watch the important reports by independent journalists Spyro Skouras and James Corbett on the contact tracing agenda in the rapidly unfolding story of coronavirus.

Contract tracing, which on the surface appears to mitigate the risk of disease spread by identifying carriers and interfering their further contact with the healthy, is based on a series of flawed assumptions:

The disease known as COVID-19 and believed to be caused by a singular infectious disease entity, i.e. the viral particle known as SARS-CoV-2, has never been validated through Koch postulates to be inducible and solely caused by SARS-CoV-2 within a controlled clinical or experimental setting. Over 100 different types of coronavirus have already been identified in circulation naturally around the world, and there is serious doubt that we can adequately distinguish between natural extracellular vesicles such as human exosomes and novel or endogenous forms of coronovirus already present in the human virome with the tests being used today, namely, RT-PCR. Learn more about this at www.questioningcovid.com That so-called “positive cases” identified through any number of over 100 different PCR-based and antibody-testing methods are accurate indicators of the presence of COVID-19, or do not generate false positives. If false positives are not accounted for, contract tracing can cause or contribute to a falsely expanding epidemic and those who are unnecessarily quarantined and treated will succumb to greatly elevated iatrogenically induced morbidity and mortality risks, which will never be discovered because the so-called “confirmed case fatality rates for COVID-19” require no viral testing, and only “suspicion of infection.” This is because the WHO and US Vital Statistics agencies explicitly advise against confirming these suspicion-based deaths through viral testing and other clinical means, in an egregious departure from both science and evidence-based medicine.

If contact tracing is fraught with technical inadequacies, why would it be so aggressively implemented nationwide? One reason is that it provides a justification for total spectrum dominance via real-time surveillance and control of the entire population under the auspices of “public health safety,” into perpetuity. In essence, it is like a new “war on terror,” but with the enemy being defined as our own bodies, or contact between bodies, and the solution the complete removal of any privacy, nor right to exempt oneself or children from medical mandates. The system would likely include tracking GPS data of mobile device users and then following back their contacts to identify, test, isolate, quarantine, medicate, or otherwise vaccinate them when one becomes available most likely in the fall of 2020. The media has already fomented profound fear through misreporting, misrepresenting, and catastrophizing case fatality projections, over the past few months. Their egregious disregard for the truth has lead to socioenomic and psychobiological impacts that are arguably orders of magnitude more harmful and deadly than this, or any other virus believed to contribute to flu-like illness. Clearly, the media and power that be could re-manufacture another crisis, or “second” or “third” wave simply be repeating what they have already one (learn more on the topic via the Corbett Report). At which point, with an army of contact tracers, testers, quarantine enforcers, and medicators and vaccinators, the systems being funded by H.R. 6666 would be ready to further this agenda.

So, why does H.R. 6666 refrain from providing even the most rudimentary details to how one of the largest and most widespread in impact bills ever introduced will impact those affected? The more vague and broad the language, the less oversight. The truth is that the detailed plans for how H.R.666 will be implemented were already written and revealed to the public a month ago by the Rockefeller Foundation in a 30-page plan titled, “NATIONAL COVID-19 TESTING ACTION PLAN:Pragmatic steps to reopen our workplaces and our communities.” Not coincidentally, the plan proposed the exact same dollar figure was required - 100 billion dollars -- and suggested that between 100-300,000 contract tracers would be needed.

Alessandra Tarantino/AP

Rome — Italy will give temporary work permits to more than half a million undocumented migrants deemed essential to picking crops and caring for the elderly amid the country's coronavirus lockdown as part of a stimulus package agreed late Wednesday.



""We have worked on this decree knowing that the country is in great difficulty,"" Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said after a cabinet meeting.

For more than two months, stay-at-home orders have prevented seasonal laborers from Eastern Europe traveling to Italy to work in farming. The glut of farm hands has fueled fears of food shortages and led the agriculture industry to rely on an estimated 500,000 illicitly hired, unregistered migrants, largely from North Africa, as spring crops ripen in the fields.

""The food on our table comes from these fields. Now we must hand over those rights which have been denied to those who work in them,"" said Peppe Provenzano, minister for the south of Italy.

U.S. farmers struggle with coronavirus' effect on labor

Agriculture lobbies had warned that Italy risked wasting massive amounts of produce if nobody was there to pick it, exacerbating the fallout of a shutdown already costing the food sector more than $7.5 billion in the country.



The measure approved Wednesday was proposed by Agriculture Minister Teresa Bellanova as part of a long-delayed stimulus package of nearly $60 billion meant to help Italy's beleaguered businesses and families weather the pandemic and lockdown.



""This decree provides the prerequisites so that this phase of reopening can immediately offer the prospect of an economic and social recovery,"" Conte told journalists.



Proponents of the measure say it will advance public health interests, too, as migrants won't need to hide from authorities any longer in squats and camps where poor hygiene conditions make fertile ground for coronavirus clusters.



The move came after Pope Francis decried ""farm hands exploited in the countryside,"" saying ""dignity should be given to work,"" with proper pay and safe conditions.

Italy struggles to find space for bodies despite flattening virus curve

The measure also applies to about 100,000 undocumented migrants who assist the elderly — the demographic most severely at risk in an outbreak that has already killed 31,106 people in Italy. It's the third-highest recorded death toll in the world, after the United States and Britain.



Nonetheless, the decree sparked a major controversy in a country whose gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to shrink by more than 9% and where unemployment is projected to reach 12.7% by the end of the year, according to the International Monetary Fund.



Opposition leader Matteo Salvini, of the nationalist League party, blasted the decision in a Twitter post, saying: ""Why should we ever reward those illegals and those who exploit them when there are so many Italians and legal migrants looking for a job?""



The hardline position was previously backed by the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement (M5S), which shares power with the center-left Democrats in a coalition government. But M5S dropped its opposition as it risked toppling the fragile coalition under Prime Minister Conte.



Located just a few hundred miles from the coast of North Africa, Italy has been by far the largest European destination for migrants setting sail from Libya and Tunisia in the past decade.

16,000 migrants have fled to Lesbos this year – and there’s only one humanitarian boat left to help

More than 6 million migrants were living in Italy in 2019. More than 500,000 of them were undocumented, according to an annual report by the Ismu Foundation, a think-tank focused on migration issues.



The stimulus package, originally promised last month, takes immediate effect, and comes on the heels of an initial $27 billion package introduced in March. It includes a mix of tax cuts and grants to help businesses survive the economic downturn, while also aiming to help families with subsidies for childcare, and to boost the ravaged tourism sector.",real

Although, SARS-Cov-2 primarily causes lung infection through binding of ACE2 receptors present on the alveolar epithelial cells, yet it was recently reported that SARS-CoV-2 RNA was found in the faeces of infected patients. Interestingly, the intestinal epithelial cells particularly the enterocytes of the small intestine also express ACE2 receptors. Role of the gut microbiota in influencing lung diseases has been well articulated. It is also known that respiratory virus infection causes perturbations in the gut microbiota. Diet, environmental factors and genetics play an important role in shaping gut microbiota which can influence immunity. Gut microbiota diversity is decreased in old age and Covid-19 has been mainly fatal in elderly patients which again points to the role the gut microbiota may play in this disease. Improving gut microbiota profile by personalized nutrition and supplementation known to improve immunity can be one of the prophylactic ways by which the impact of this disease can be minimized in old people and immune-compromised patients. More trials may be initiated to see the effect of co-supplementation of personalized functional food including prebiotics/probiotics along with current therapies.",fake

The English league had given a tentative return date of April 30 but that was pushed back with a statement saying the “2019-20 season will only return when it is safe and appropriate to do so” and only with the full support of government and medical guidance.

“There is a combined objective for all remaining domestic league and cup matches to be played,” the league said, “enabling us to maintain the integrity of each competition.”

Teams still have nine or 10 games left to play, with Liverpool — the leader by 25 points — still needing two more wins to clinch its first title since 1990.

UEFA, in a letter signed by the European Clubs’ Association and the European Leagues, has urged members not to abandon their competitions. Halting leagues without approval from UEFA could see teams blocked from qualifying for the Champions League and Europa League as they are determined based on final positions in domestic standings.

In a statement released after the 20 teams met by video conference, the league said it voted to advance funds of 125 million pounds ($150 million) to clubs in the English Football League and fifth-tier National League, many of which are struggling to cope with the financial consequences of the suspension of matches.

It also committed 20 million pounds ($24 million) to Britain’s National Health Service.

At the end of a week when Premier League players came under growing public pressure to forego some of their salaries to help pay club staff, the league said clubs had agreed to consult players over a wage deduction or deferral of 30% “in the face of substantial and continuing losses.”

“The league will be in regular contact with the Professional Footballers’ Association,” read the statement, “and the union will join a meeting which will be held tomorrow between the league, players and club representatives.”",real

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain lifted on Tuesday a ban on direct flights and ships from Italy imposed since March 11 to curb the coronavirus, but tourism restrictions and a 14-day quarantine for inbound travellers remained in place.

A much-reduced death rate from COVID-19 has encouraged Spain to begin easing one of Europe’s strictest lockdowns, but the tourism-dependent economy is likely to have to wait until late June to welcome holidaymakers back.

Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez is preparing to ask parliament to extend until late June a state of emergency which has helped limit infections but also brought unprecedented restrictions on borders and movement, causing huge economic damage.

Cadena Ser radio reported that cabinet would use a meeting on Tuesday to discuss an extension until June 27. A government spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment.

At the peak of the outbreak, Spain was losing hundreds of citizens a day as stretched hospitals and care homes struggled to treat patients.

But the overnight death toll reported on Monday was 59, the lowest in two months, bringing the known total to 27,709.

Lime may have little choice to suspend service in California after the Bay Area’s “shelter in place” order effectively bans nonessential travel “on foot, bicycle, scooter, automobile or public transit,” according to the San Francisco Chronicle. But the decision to ground its scooter fleet in Washington and three European countries, places hard hit by the pandemic, is so far unprecedented in the nascent micromobility space.

Lime may have little choice to suspend service in California

So far, other major scooter companies like Bird, Spin, Skip, Uber, and Lyft have yet to take similar dramatic measures. In response to a request for comment, spokespeople for those companies said they had yet to make a decision or were closely monitoring the situation.

All of the scooter companies have said they have stepped up their cleaning procedures and are advising customers to protect themselves by wearing gloves while riding.

The pandemic could be a disaster for the scooter rental business, especially coming on the heels of the winter season, which is when most companies see a large dip in ridership and revenue. In January, the company announced that it was laying off 14 percent of its workers and exiting 12 markets.

Lime, along with its rivals like Bird, Uber, and Lyft, have struggled to make scooter-sharing profitable. Most experts agree that the market is oversaturated and needs to consolidate. Lime joins Bird, Skip, Scoot, and Lyft in laying off its scooter-related employees in recent months.",real

Job loss is leading many of our friends and neighbors to miss rent, which in turn makes the buildings they call home vulnerable to foreclosure when landlords are unable to pay their own expenses.

The numbers are stark. Affordable housing providers in Chicago recently surveyed by the Department of Housing reported decreases in rent collection as high as 61 percent over the last few weeks. It is the same sad story across the country. The National Multifamily Housing Council, a multifamily apartment building industry group, polled its membership and found a 60% increase in nonpayment through April 12 compared to the same period a year ago.

Opinion

Even before the crisis, 63 percent of African American renters and 56 percent of Latino renters in Chicago were cost-burdened, as compared to 42 percent of white renters. Let’s face it: Long before the first case of COVID-19 was diagnosed, Chicago was a city with profound racial and economic segregation and insufficient affordable housing.

COVID-19 is not creating inequities, it is simply reflecting those we already had.

The road to recovery has to involve us supporting each other as never before. If you are one of the fortunate who has not lost income during this time, one of the best ways to support those who have is to pay your rent.

Landlords have a better shot at being flexible with those who cannot pay if those who can, do. A wave of evictions or foreclosures is not in anyone’s interest.

The city is doing all that it can to address the crisis. Before March ended, the housing department made 2,000 grants for housing assistance available and received 83,000 applications in just five days. (Donate to the next round at https://givetogethernow.org/; under Location Preference, select Chicago.)

Last week, we introduced new grants to our affordable housing landlords to make up for rental shortfalls and remove red tape to refinance city loans in weeks instead of months. The grants should greatly help stabilize more than 3,400 units of affordable housing, keeping thousands of men, women and children safe and secure in their homes.

As the mayor says, we are all in this together. But the “all” must include the federal government, too.

The federal CARES Act provided a strong start for many issues, but only a sliver was dedicated to housing. To meet the scale of the crisis, we simply need more federal resources to keep low- and moderate-income Chicagoans housed. We’re talking $100 billion nationally for direct rental assistance alone, according to the National Low-Income Housing Coalition.

Here’s what else Chicago’s renters and owners need from Washington’s next COVID-19 relief package:

Emergency rental assistance and long-term sustained support for programs that produce and preserve affordable housing . Short-term direct rental assistance would meet the needs of tenants who don’t already have a subsidy like a Housing Choice Voucher and can help landlords to stay afloat.

. Short-term direct rental assistance would meet the needs of tenants who don’t already have a subsidy like a Housing Choice Voucher and can help landlords to stay afloat. Funding for local governments that can backfill revenue losses . This will allow us to better resource response efforts such as our Housing Assistance Fund and Emergency Relief for Affordable Multifamily Properties Program.

. This will allow us to better resource response efforts such as our Housing Assistance Fund and Emergency Relief for Affordable Multifamily Properties Program. Relief for city-supported affordable housing developments. The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program is by far the largest program the city has to create and preserve new affordable rental homes. It is crucial during this unprecedented crisis that LIHTC buildings in the pipeline receive extensions on key deadlines to ensure this program continues serving Chicago’s low-income renters.

Those are some of the many things we need from the federal government. These precious resources, however, must be dispersed in a manner that accounts for COVID-19’s disproportionate impact on black and brown communities.

History tells us to expect an inequitable impact: During the housing crisis that began in 2008, black and Latino households were nearly 50 percent more likely to face foreclosure than white households, and the racial wealth gap widened. Just as we’ve seen with disproportionate levels of COVID-19 infection and death among black people, we are concerned about and working to solve for the housing impacts of the virus on communities of color.

Our housing solutions must and will address the needs of both tenants and landlords. We are committed to avoiding both widespread evictions and foreclosures. We know that by providing or maintaining stable, affordable housing, we are investing in the people who live there, who by having a quality, affordable place to call home, can be freed up to focus on the other parts of their lives that matter: Family, work, school and, of course, health.

Here are some highlights to know Wednesday:

President Donald Trump declined to respond to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's comments about him taking hydroxychloroquine, a drug that has not been proven to work against the coronavirus, telling reporters: ""I don't respond to her. I think she's a waste of time.""

The Trump administration extended the U.S. border closure to Canada and Mexico for another 30 days.

Responding to a question from Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said ""no workers should give their lives"" to boost the economy.

Hollywood movie mogul Harvey Weinstein's extradition to face more sex-crime charges in California has been delayed because of the coronavirus pandemic.

What we're watching today: In Michigan, downtown Midland could be under 9 feet of water, says Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who declared a state of emergency after two dams breached following days of rain. Evacuating residents amid the pandemic is another thing to worry about.

But, whoa. A Florida block party that drew 3,000 people got shut down amid violence and calls of racism. Officials say things got violent when a rifle was pointed, launching a string of incidents that led to a sheriff’s deputy being struck with a bar stool and another sustaining a leg injury.

Food prices soar to highest one-month increase since '74; eggs up 16% in April

Grocery store bills shot up April, showing the biggest monthly increase in nearly 50 years, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistic's monthly Consumer Price Index report.

While overall the April CPI declined 0.8%, consumers on average paid 2.6% more for groceries. It's the largest one-month increase since February 1974. During the last 12 months, grocery prices rose 4.1%.

Price increases in the meat, poultry, fish and egg category were the steepest. Egg prices had the biggest jump as consumers paid 16.1% more in April than in March for eggs. Prices for eggs, according to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) were as high as $3 a dozen in April.

New York's MTA to use UV light to disinfect subways, buses

Transit officials in New York announced a new program to disinfect subways and buses relying on the power of ultraviolet light to kill the new coronavirus.

The Metropolitan Transportation Authority will spend roughly $1 million on 150 UV lamps used to disinfect trains and buses, the agency announced Tuesday.

""To our knowledge, this is the first reported test of its kind, period,"" Patrick Foye, chairman and CEO of MTA said, per ABC News.

MTA is working with researchers at Columbia University on the project to research how UV light can stop the virus.

'What in God's name is he doing?': Biden rips Trump for saying he uses hydroxychloroquine

Former Vice President Joe Biden criticized President Donald Trump for saying he uses hydroxychloroquine, a drug unproven to treat or prevent the new coronavirus.

""It's like saying maybe if you injected Clorox into your blood, you know it may cure you. Come on, man. What is he doing? What in God's name is he doing?"" Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, said during a virtual Yahoo News town hall. ""The things the president say, the words of a president, matter.""

Biden worried that people may hear Trump's comments and start using the drug themselves. The Food and Drug Administration has warned against improper use of the drug for COVID-19 outside a hospital or clinical trial setting, citing evidence that the drug could have potentially fatal side effects.

""Look, this is absolutely irresponsible. There's no serious medical personnel out there saying to use that drug. It's counterproductive. It's not going to help,"" Biden said.

After scientist fired, Florida gov. calls coronavirus data manipulation charge a 'nonissue'

Facing an explosive charge that his administration is manipulating coronavirus data to help make the case for reopening Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis played down the controversy Tuesday as a “nonissue.”

The accusations levied by Rebekah Jones, a data expert at the Florida Department of Health, could undercut the governor’s reopening push, which he has called a “safe” and “step by step” approach despite its COVID-19 death toll topping 2,000 Tuesday.

Jones wrote in an email last week that she no longer was overseeing the state’s COVID-19 dashboard, which she built and managed for two months. She wrote that she ""would not expect the new team to continue the same level of accessibility and transparency.""

But DeSantis said at a Tuesday news conference that Jones sent an email to her supervisor saying the comments were being misinterpreted.

Jones told Florida Today that she was fired on Monday. And she said in an email to the CBS12 television station in West Palm Beach that she faced blowback because she refused to ""manually change data to drum up support for the plan to reopen.""

DeSantis spokeswoman Helen Aguirre Ferré, in a separate statement after the news conference, said Jones was fired for ""insubordination.""

CDC quietly releases longer, detailed reopening guidance: reports

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention quietly published a longer 60-page document providing guidance to businesses, restaurants, schools and other establishments on how to reopen while minimizing the risk of spreading the virus, CNN and Politico reported.

The document comes after the agency had released six one-page documents and faced criticism amid reports that the Trump administration shelved the longer, more detailed reopening guidance for being too specific.

Politico and CNN reported Trump administration officials delayed the release of the document because of references to religious organizations that they feared were being unfairly targeted. References to faith-based groups were removed from the final 60-page document, an unnamed CDC official told CNN.

Michigan conservative group to hold 'Operation Haircut' on Capitol lawn

The Michigan Conservative Coalition, an organization intended to shape policy and help more conservatives win election, will hold what it's calling Operation Haircut outside the Capitol on Wednesday. They will protest Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's stay-at-home order and the closing of barbershops and hair salons.

“Michigan’s small business owners are patriotic and law-abiding citizens but enough is enough,” said Marian Sheridan, a co-founder of the group, who added that marijuana dispensaries remain open but ""barber shops are, somehow, unsafe.""

Michigan State Police did not immediately disclose how they would react to the event. Organizers said those attending ""will be encouraged to comply with social distancing and other safe practices,"" such as wearing masks, but people providing haircuts would not be able to remain six feet away from people getting them, as required by the order.

Donald Trump calls high number of US coronavirus cases a ‘badge of honor'

President Donald Trump on Tuesday called the number of COVID-19 cases in the United States – the highest in the world – a “badge of honor,” arguing the still-increasing number of cases is simply evidence the country is testing more people.

“By the way, you know, when you say that we lead in cases, that’s because we have more testing than anybody else,” the president said at the White House. “When we have a lot of cases, I don’t look at that as a bad thing. I look at that in a certain respect as being a good thing, because it means our testing is much better. So, if we were testing a million people instead of 14 million people, it would have far few cases, right?""

The U.S. has performed more than 12 million tests, according to the Covid Tracking Project. However, the country still faces testing shortages after months of hurdles in development and access.

McDonald's workers in 20 cities set to strike over lack of COVID-19 protections

Hundreds of McDonald’s workers in 20 cities plan to strike Wednesday, the day before the company’s annual shareholders meeting, as part of an effort to pressure the fast-food chain into improving what they say are inadequate protections for employees during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Labor organizers say scores of McDonald's workers in at least 16 states have COVID-19. A survey of more than 800 workers, organizers say, found 42% reported being told not to wear protective gear by management and 46% said they came to work feeling sick because they were afraid they would be disciplined or penalized.

The strike is supported by the Service Employees International Union and is being organized by the ""Fight for $15"" minimum-wage labor campaign.

The company disputes the allegations.

US extends border closures to Canada, Mexico until June 22 amid coronavirus

Travelers looking to make a trip to Canada or Mexico will have to wait another 30 days as the Department of Homeland Security extended border closures to curb COVID-19 infections.

Chad Wolf, the acting Secretary of Homeland Security, announced Tuesday that the U.S.-Canada and U.S.-Mexico land border closure has been extended until June 22.

The U.S. and Canada first limited travel in March for a period of 30 days after President Donald Trump and Trudeau agreed to close the border to help contain the spread of coronavirus. In Mexico, the U.S. limited travel in March for a period of 30 days after Trump said the country agreed to close the border to help stem the spread of the coronavirus.

Pier 1 Imports to shutter all stores

Pier 1 Imports, which previously said it would close half of its stores, now plans to close all of its locations.

The retailer, based in Fort Worth, Texas, announced Tuesday that it was seeking bankruptcy court approval to begin an “orderly wind-down” when stores are able to reopen ""following the government-mandated closures during the COVID-19 pandemic.”

The company says it has approximately 541 U.S. stores. In a court filing, the company says it plans to reopen some stores on or around May 22 for ""store closing efforts and liquidation sales.""

Mnuchin: 'No workers should give their lives' to boost GDP, stock market

Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said no worker should die in order to boost the U.S. economy. Mnuchin was responding to a question in an exchange with Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, during a hearing on the coronavirus relief legislation.

""How many workers should give their lives to increase the GDP or the Dow by 1,000 points?"" Brown asked.

""No workers should give their lives to do that, Senator, and I think your characterization is unfair,"" Mnuchin replied.

Mnuchin also faced sharp questioning from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., about whether companies would have to keep employees on their payrolls if they received aid from a joint Fed-Treasury program. “You’re boosting your Wall Street buddies,"" Warren told the secretary when he declined to comment.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell testified Tuesday that the Fed and Congress ""may need to do more"" to help revive the economy.

Coronavirus lockdowns have caused a whopping drop in carbon emissions

The coronavirus lockdowns have had an “extreme” effect on daily carbon emissions, causing a whopping 17% drop globally during peak confinement measures by early April – levels last seen in 2006.

However, it is unlikely to last, according to a new analysis by an international team of scientists published in the peer-reviewed British journal Nature Climate Change.

This is the first analysis to measure the pandemic-driven global drop in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from January to April of this year.

While the impact of lockdown measures is likely to lead to the largest annual decrease in emissions since the end of World War II, 2020 is still on track to be one of the five hottest years on record, and the study notes that these reductions are no “silver lining.”

As a reminder, China didn’t inform the world about the evidence of human to human transmission (which they likely possessed for 6+ weeks at that point) until Jan. 22.

Despite all of this, Democrats have taken a distinctly “soft on China” tack, in opposition to President Trump’s increasing hawkishness, even going so far as to side with the CCP (which, remember, just put 1 million+ Muslims into concentration camps) over the White House, as the National Review pointed out in a recent article.

REUTERS/Tingshu Wang

BEIJING (Reuters) - Adorned with intricate designs of orchids, camellias and Chinese characters symbolising good luck, the stylish silk masks created by Chinese fashion designer Zhou Li have become coveted items during the coronavirus outbreak.

Zhou, whose Dejin fashion brand recently exhibited at China Fashion Week, has been making embroidered silk masks equipped with high specification N95 air filters since February, providing the fashion-conscious with protective options.

“When the situation turned very serious, we saw that many people needed to change their masks every four hours,” said Zhou, explaining how she came up with the idea for the reusable masks made from colourful Chinese silk.

Now, as China and other countries lift restrictions, Zhou expects masks will be a necessity for the foreseeable future. She has adapted hers for summer, making them with a thinner silk that allows for better breathability in warmer weather.

The 55-year-old, who is director of design at Shandong Sunbird Garment company, enjoys adding traditional Chinese motifs to her work.

A yellow mask displayed at a workshop in Beijing’s art district is decorated with golden orchids, representing a harmonious family with abundant wealth and many children.

Zhou is also designing personal protective suits, many also featuring flowers, after her friends asked for stylish outer wear to use during air travel.

The company can make around 600 masks a day, and sells them online at 118 yuan ($16) a piece. Zhou plans to market them by inviting influencers to participate in live-streaming on e-commerce platforms, and hopes to expand sales in England and Italy.

“I hope people can wear my masks that protect them, make them look beautiful, bring them good luck and keep them safe,” she said.",real

Late last night, Facebook began banning all links from Brighteon.com, regardless of the content of the videos, claiming that videos about gardening and smoothie recipes and backyard chickens now violate Facebook’s “community guidelines.”

The real reason for the banning, of course, is that Brighteon.com hosts the “Plandemic” video featuring Dr. Judy Mikovits who warns about the dangers of the coronavirus vaccine. Users have posted a Portuguese version of the documentary that has achieved nearly a million views, and a Greek language version is also rapidly gaining hundreds of thousands of views.

The rapid explosion in people viewing the video has resulted in Facebook blacklisting the entire Brighteon platform, confirming Facebook is engaged in anti-trust behavior to try to crush competing platforms by starving them of user traffic. This is blatant criminal anti-trust behavior on the part of Facebook, and it is a direct attack on human knowledge and human freedom.

Even more importantly, both Facebook and YouTube now openly claim that any content which contradicts the “official” opinions of the W.H.O. will be banned, meaning Facebook and YouTube are now run by communist China, because that’s the anti-human rights regime that dictates the policies of the W.H.O.

Facebook scrubs all Natural News content posted since November of 2019

Adding to the extreme, punitive censorship, Facebook also banned all links from NaturalNews.com and NewsTarget.com while scrubbing all the content we have posted, back to November of 2019, which is the month in which the Wuhan coronavirus bioweapon was released by communist China.

Any attempt to post any link from Natural News or NewsTarget is now blocked by Facebook, and Facebook has scrubbed all our posts about the coronavirus in order to cover up communist China’s war against humanity.

In effect, Facebook is now covering up the bioweapons crimes of communist China by banning independent media publishers that are documenting China’s deliberate engineering and release of this weapon against humanity.

This puts Mark Zuckerberg in the same class as Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin, actively carrying out crimes against humanity and defending an anti-human regime that builds weapons of mass destruction to cause mass death on a global scale. Mark Zuckerberg is an enemy of humanity and a criminal against all who value life and liberty.

We repeat our call for the arrest and prosecution of Mark Zuckerberg, Jack Dorsey, Sundar Pichai, Tim Cook and other tech giant CEOs that have engaged in malicious, anti-human censorship that protects communist China and the vaccine industry.

How to share the Plandemic video on Facebook and other platforms without getting banned

Because of the extreme level of criminal censorship being carried out by Facebook, YouTube, Google, Twitter and even Vimeo, the only current way to share Plandemic videos from Brighteon.com or other targeted platforms is to embed the videos on another website page, then share that page.

Each video on Brighteon.com has a “share” link at the bottom right-hand corner:

From the share link, you can copy either the direct link to the video play page or get embed code that embeds the video into any web page. This code can be pasted into the HTML code of any page, including pages that are edited in WordPress or other page editors.

Here’s an example of the embed code for the Plandemic video from the “Jesus Social” channel on Brighteon:

<iframe src=’https://www.brighteon.com/embed/45c1558c-4163-4961-9f92-11c7c4c1af21′ width=’560′ height=’315′ frameborder=’0′ allowfullscreen></iframe>

And here’s the embedded video it produces when you add this code to your web page:

Once the video is embedded in your page, you can then share that page on Facebook or other platforms.

You can also, of course, share Brighteon links on Gab.com and other alternative internet ecosystems that aren’t run by evil globalists working for communist China.

In the future, we will also have alternate URLs and domain names that will allow you to share Brighteon videos, but those domains will of course be eventually banned by Facebook and the other tech giants, all of which are criminal operations that are complicit in communist China’s war against humanity.

The tech giants will not stop until they succeed in destroying humanity and achieving mass death across the globe

We have now arrived at a very dark chapter in human history where the gatekeepers who control online speech are protecting the very communist regime that has declared war on humanity through the deliberate deployment of engineered bioweapons. Mark Zuckerberg and other big tech globalists are criminals against humanity, and they no longer even pretend to support free speech. Instead, they brazenly censor all platforms and publishers that are working to blow the whistle on global criminals who wield weapons of mass destruction against the innocent.

This is why today, we are repeating our call for the arrest and prosecution of Mark Zuckerberg and the CEOs of Google, YouTube, Twitter and Vimeo for their conspiracy against humankind and their deliberate, malicious crimes against human freedom and human survival.

Human freedom cannot coexist with these evil, anti-human regimes. We either dismantle the tech giants and imprison their architects and leaders, or humanity dies in darkness.

Even if it is his last act, President Trump must deploy military police to arrest the CEOs of the tech giants and prosecute them under military tribunals for their crimes against humanity. Trump must order the US State Department to seize the domain names of all the tech giants engaged in malicious censorship, halting their operations until they restore First Amendment protections on their platforms. In just 24 hours, Trump could order the US government to seize Google.com, Apple.com, Twitter.com, YouTube.com, Vimeo.com and all the other domains run by the techno-fascists, and he could force them to either respect the First Amendment or be permanently put out of business.

And no, that isn’t tyranny on the part of government, not when the only demand is that tech platforms must respect the freedoms described in the Bill of Rights. For the free world to thrive, Sec. 230 must be dismantled and free speech must be affirmed across the internet, or humanity has no future other than death and tyranny.

That’s the whole plan behind the coronavirus, of course: To unleash mass death, tyranny and censorship, carrying out a new holocaust against billions of innocent people so that globalists can achieve their depopulation dreams.

Watch my recent interview with Dr. Judy Mikovits to find out why globalists are so afraid of this woman that they are blacklisting entire platforms to prevent her voice from being heard:

The news was issued as an unclassified public service announcement on CISA’s website on Wednesday. News reports over the weekend first said the warning, which is directed at organizations working on vaccine research, was imminent as numerous countries have redirected intelligence efforts toward other nations’ responses to and research on COVID-19.

“The FBI is investigating the targeting and compromise of U.S. organizations conducting COVID-19-related research by PRC-affiliated cyber actors and non-traditional collectors,” the PSA reads. “These actors have been observed attempting to identify and illicitly obtain valuable intellectual property (IP) and public health data related to vaccines, treatments, and testing from networks and personnel affiliated with COVID-19-related research. The potential theft of this information jeopardizes the delivery of secure, effective, and efficient treatment options.”

“The FBI is investigating the targeting and compromise of U.S. organizations by PRC-affiliated cyber actors.”

The US is not alone here, nor is China the only country attempting to use cyberattacks to spy and gather intelligence on other countries’ coronavirus treatment efforts and to capitalize on the current pandemic. Israel has accused Iran of attempting to cripple its water supply amid shelter-in-place orders. Earlier this month. the US and the UK issued a joint warning about the targeting of health care organizations and pharmaceutical and medical research companies. The warning didn’t name specific countries, but it insinuated that hacking threats may come from known bad actors, or “advanced persistent threat groups” as the warning words it, like China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia.

The US State Department and the Trump administration are also engaged in a high-level back-and-forth with the Chinese government over assigning blame for the coronavirus pandemic and demands for global compensation, which itself stems in part from Trump’s adversarial relationship with the country throughout his presidency over trade secret theft and the outsourcing of American jobs and manufacturing. The US is now accusing China of spreading misinformation about the source of the virus and downplaying the severity and death toll of its ongoing outbreak to better position itself in the aftermath.

The PSA says that vaccine research organizations should be well aware that any press attention on its efforts may lead to heightened security risks, as it could tip off Chinese hackers and lead to potential cyberattacks. CISA and the FBI ask that such organizations patch all systems for vulnerabilities, actively scan all web applications for unauthorized access, improve security with protections like multistep authentication, and identify and suspend access to any suspicious accounts.",real

Humans around the world are stuck inside due to the coronavirus. How is the natural world reacting in the absence of all the noise we usually make?

ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:

Life on lockdown inside our homes might be noisy. Outside, the streets and skies are noticeably quieter, and because there's less human sound out there, many people are hearing more wildlife. As Invisibilia's Abby Wendle reports, the relationship between human noise and the rest of nature is often discordant. So is our quiet in this moment having any impact?

ABBY WENDLE, BYLINE: The Internet is humming with rumors of animals reclaiming cities and towns. Dolphins are allegedly swimming in Venetian canals, black bears are supposedly raiding trash cans in LA, and mountain goats have been seen descending the Welsh hills to stroll through town. Some of these quarantine silver lining stories have been debunked, though for now, at least, the goats seem legit. But other anecdotes about nature being more present in the absence of humans come from reliable sources. NPR's own Eleanor Beardsley observed, for the first time in years, birds singing throughout Paris.

ELEANOR BEARDSLEY, BYLINE: But what really blew my mind is I'm sitting by the Seine River right now on a sunny evening, and I just heard a river bird - like, egrets on poles and stuff.

(SOUNDBITE OF BIRD CALLING)

BEARDSLEY: Is that not wild? I have never heard that before.

BERNIE KRAUSE: Yeah. We can hear subtlety of life around us that we haven't heard in a long, long time.

WENDLE: This is Bernie Krause, one of the founders of a field called soundscape ecology that studies how all the sounds in an ecosystem interact with each other and with us. Krause has been recording the natural world for more than 50 years, and in that time he's observed lots of ways our noise is disruptive to wildlife.

KRAUSE: Let's see if I have the frogs and jet flyover.

WENDLE: He tells this one story of how, back in the 1990s, he was recording thousands of frogs that gather in the spring at Mono Lake in California and croak in unison.

(SOUNDBITE OF FROGS CROAKING)

KRAUSE: Notice how they sound really big.

WENDLE: Almost like all the little frogs have joined together to become one giant frog. It's actually a defense mechanism - helps keep predators from locating and attacking individual frogs. But Krause says the military started doing test flights over Mono Basin, and the roar of the jets would cause the frogs to fall out of sync.

(SOUNDBITE OF FROGS CROAKING)

KRAUSE: They would take, like, 45 minutes before they could get in sync again. And during that period of time, we watched as a couple of great horned owls and a coyote came in and picked off a couple of frogs.

WENDLE: Eventually, this led to significant population decline all because of a jet. But Krause says it's not just jets. It's helicopters and chainsaws and tractors and traffic.

KRAUSE: I mean, just endless amounts of noise.

WENDLE: Until now. With billions of people stuck inside, our noise print is dramatically quieter. In Paris, for instance, a group that monitors noise pollution saw as much as a 90% drop in human sounds since the city went on lockdown. So how is this relative quiet impacting wildlife?

MEGAN GALL: There was a question trending on Google. Are birds singing louder?

WENDLE: This is Megan Gall, a sensory ecologist and professor at Vassar College.

GALL: If anything, I would actually guess that the birds are not singing as loud.

WENDLE: That's because, Gall says, they aren't having to compete against human sound, which could be a good thing for the birds.

(SOUNDBITE OF BIRD CALLING)

WENDLE: For one thing, Gall explains, noise has been shown to increase stress hormone responses in birds, which affects immune function. So less noise right now might equal less illness. Plus, birds living in bustling cities or even busy suburban neighborhoods have to expend a lot of energy singing louder. So now that things are quieter, she says the birds might have extra energy to use on different things.

GALL: Like spending time foraging, saving energy to feed your kids, et cetera. So possibly, we'll see animals that have larger broods or healthier offspring. You might also get changes in how females are selecting mates. Now, a lot of that's speculation, of course, but I think there's a lot of really interesting things that could be happening.

WENDLE: While how this all plays out for wildlife is, for the time being, left to informed speculation, one impact of our stillness is ringing clear as a bell.

So the Earth is, like, literally humming underneath of our feet.

ANDY FRASSETTO: That's right. Yep.

WENDLE: Andy Frassetto a seismologist who recently observed, along with colleagues in Brussels and California, a huge drop in human-caused vibrations on the Earth's crust.

FRASSETTO: It was impressive. It was just a reminder that we as a civilization have a noticeable imprint on the world in ways that, sometimes, we don't appreciate.

WENDLE: I, for one, did not appreciate that humans rattle the earth like a tiny earthquake, but we do, mostly from transportation. Automobiles, planes, trains, even our walking registers on seismographs as a kind of constant static. And now that static is way less noisy, giving seismologists a unique opportunity to perhaps detect more subtle vibrations that usually get drowned out, like the ones coming from inside volcanoes close to cities.

FRASSETTO: I think it's an open question how strong this change is, but it's something that I know people in the seismology community are really interested in exploring.

WENDLE: And some scientists are attempting to measure this strange and profound sonic experiment above ground. The Silent Cities project is a call for scientists, journalists, artists, really anyone with good enough audio equipment to record what they're hearing while stuck at home.

AMANDINE GASC: To me, it's very peaceful to walk and, like, able to, like, hear the teeny tiny sounds.

WENDLE: Amandine Gasc is a soundscape ecologist in southern France who helped create the project.

GASC: Like insects moving in leaves, for example, buzzing in the flowers - also, it's spring right now, so it increase also the noise, the wildlife sounds you can hear.

WENDLE: So far, participants are recording at 161 locations all over the world, and the data - an expected 35,000 hours or more of audio - will be available for any researcher who wants to analyze it in the future. Listening to our new sound environment is not just for researchers, though. Ecologist Megan Gall says it can be for everyone.

GALL: One of the potentially positive things that could come out of this is that people are having a chance to interact with the world around them in a way that they maybe haven't interacted with it before.

WENDLE: And those interactions could lead people like Eleanor Beardsley to not only consider the wildlife around them now - the birds singing on the Seine - but help them keep it in mind as things get back to being noisier.

BEARDSLEY: It makes me feel like they're here, and we don't pay attention to them. And we need to because they deserve to have the city as well. It's their land, too.

BEARDSLEY: There he goes. Isn't he cute?

WENDLE: Yes, he is. In this incredibly scary and overwhelming time, he's a refuge.

Amid the global pandemic, we were forced shortly after spring break from in-person classes to meeting on Zoom.

It seemed a relevant undertaking for students tasked mainly with writing about the world through the third-person objective observer lens. The assignment: Write a first-person essay on the impact of the pandemic upon their lives. Here are some of their reflections, which will be publicly podcasted soon:

Columnists In-depth political coverage, sports analysis, entertainment reviews and cultural commentary.

Dylan Jeninga, a sophomore, writes, “There are invisible people, everyone knows that. They work hard to get us to notice them, but too often, we don’t. We walk by and hope they don’t talk to us.

“One such person lives, or did live, on the corner of Broadway and Granville, near my apartment. I don’t know her name. But she’s been there as long as I’ve lived in the neighborhood, wrapped in too many coats, selling Streetwise magazines.

“Once, when I worked at (a store) down the street, we got into a shouting match because she was spending too long in our bathroom, and my boss told me to kick her out. Ever since, I’ve avoided her. I walk right past without even looking at her.

“Of course, I haven’t done that much since the COVID-19 outbreak locked the city down. I’ve been sheltering in place... Even so, she’s been there, selling her magazines, her worldly belongings piled into a rusty cart behind her…

“.. .We may never know the full cost of the pandemic. But I do know that the woman has disappeared. ... All I can think about are all the times I walked by and tried not to look at her.”

Grace Koeppen, a sophomore integrated marketing communications major, writes: “It’s 7:30 a.m, and typically I’d be refreshed and ready to start my morning on campus. Instead I’m quarantined at home, groggy, with my laptop at my feet, holding 13 unread emails, four assignments due, and a Zoom meeting scheduled for two hours from now.

“This pandemic has misplaced me from everything that appeared normal … Working from home is hard.”

Daniel Itonyo, a senior economics major, writes: “To be honest, I’m not even sure what day it is. The coronavirus pandemic struck the world to a halt. ... The tragedy of this outbreak hits more closely when you realize that most of the deaths are within your community, the African American community.

“ … We all play a vital role, You and I, need to first of all acknowledge that it is easy to be ‘woke’ [or aware] but still fail to truly understand the urgency of the issues of racial disparity because we don’t live it and are blinded by our privileges.”

Lewis Rawlinson, a graduating musical arts major and cellist, writes, “New York City has begun mass burial for unaccounted for COVID-19 patients on Hart Island off the coast of the Bronx, the same site that was used to bury people who died of AIDS by the thousands. Those people also died alone in quarantine—one forged by stigma and bigotry.

“Those lost to the AIDS epidemic and those living with HIV today deserve respect and truth.

“During the early stages of their epidemic, there was no talk of flattening the curve. There was no emergency relief bill for resources and economic support. The government failed them and resulted in more graves that had to be dug, and it was because they were queer. That must never be forgotten.”

The same be said of the lessons from this storm. They must not be forgotten.

The Minneapolis-based retailer announced Wednesday that its Drive Up curbside pickup, in-store pickup and Shipt delivery grew by 278% in the three-month quarter, which ended May 2. The company said comparable sales, which included online purchases, increased 10.8% for the quarter.

""Throughout the first quarter, our team and guests faced unprecedented challenges arising from the spread of COVID-19,"" Target chairman and CEO Brian Cornell said in a news release. ""In the face of those challenges, our team showed extraordinary resilience as guests relied on Target as a trusted resource for their families.""

Digital sales boost:Walmart sales increase 10% as online buying grew 74% during coronavirus pandemic

Digital sales accelerated every month in the quarter and went from 33% in February to 282% in April compared to sales in the same time period last year, Target said, noting 80% of online orders were shipped from stores.

Cornell said during an earnings call that as shelter-in-place rules were adopted across the country, shoppers began to pull back on in-store shopping and the company saw a dramatic surge in digital traffic and sales.

“We also began seeing higher demand for products oriented around staying at home, including home office products, video games, puzzles, and board games, along with the housewares and kitchenware,” Cornell said.

Target reported revenue of $19.62 billion, up 11.3% over the same period a year ago. Net income fell 64% to $284 million.

The company did report higher expenses due to COVID-19 including employee wages and benefits.

Target announced Monday that it was extending the $2 an hour temporary wage increase for employees through July 4, which is two months longer than originally announced. The company is also continuing to offer access to a paid leave program for workers most susceptible to the coronavirus through the end of June.

Target also extended the two initiatives in April and officials have said the company is spending $500 million in temporary benefits, wages and bonuses for workers.

Shares of Target stock were down more than 2% as of 10:45 a.m. Wednesday.

Floyd Cardoz was an influential chef who married regional Indian cuisine with French and new American flavors. He died Wednesday morning of complications from the coronavirus in New Jersey, at age 59. He opened a string of acclaimed restaurants in both New York and Mumbai — and became a TV star along the way.

Cardoz was born in what was then Bombay, India, and grew up between that metropolis and his ancestral state of Goa. He took up cuisine against the wishes of his father. After training in Bombay and later in Switzerland, he came to New York. In 1998, he opened an influential fusion restaurant in Manhattan called Tabla with restaurateur Danny Meyer — the first in a string of innovative dining spots in both New York and Mumbai. In her review of Tabla for the New York Times, critic Ruth Reichl wrote: ""This is American food, viewed through a kaleidoscope of Indian spices. The flavors are so powerful, original and unexpected that they evoke intense emotions.""

He also became a television favorite. In 2011, he won Bravo's ""Top Chef Masters."" Earlier this month, he was in India to open a new venture. On Instagram, he was also sharing images from shooting an episode of the Netflix program Ugly Delicious with actor Aziz Ansari. On March 17, however, he shared that he had returned to the U.S. for medical treatment on March 8, writing that he was ""feeling feverish.""

In a statement to several media outlets including CNN and the Washington Post, Cardoz' company in India, Hunger Inc. Hospitality, announced that he died from complications from COVID-19 on Wednesday at Mountainside Medical Center in Montclair, N.J.",real

Former Disney child star Bella Thorne has proved a million times that she knows perfectly well how to lighten up the atmosphere as a big part of the world has already entered a third month of corona-induced self-isolation.

This time, she went still further, not merely easing her fans’ tensions, but heating the mood up, as she flaunted her slim limbs in a new selfie, wearing merely skivvies and a slight tucked-up sea-through black blouse.

“What % of my body are legs?”, the brown-eyed beauty asked saucily, appealing to her colossal army of fans and prompting expected replies.

“70%"", one opined, with others suggesting it could by anything from a suggestive ""69"" % to 99.5.

“Doesn’t matter the percentage because whatever it is, it’s the right one"", one gushed.

“Here is the 🔨hammer break the internet babe"", another praised Thorne’s update.

In the picture, like in a few previous ones, she likewise rocked a messy-chic hairstyle, showing off her newly dyed locks.

The singer and socialite, who has been staying at her California mansion throughout the corona crisis, is understood to be preparing to hit the small screen soon with the upcoming series Paradise City.

She also has several other projects in the works, both pre- and post-production - including soon-to-be released action thriller Infamous, which tells the story of the couple Arielle (Bella) and Dean (Jake Manley) venturing out on a bank-robbing rampage. The trailer came out last week, promising enough time for a fresh Bonnie and Clyde story to be appreciated by avid online cinema enthusiasts.

Infamous is set for a digital release, with screenings slated to take place in a number of “virtual cinemas”, on 12 June, as the anti-coronavirus measures are projected to continue. Thorne has four other film projects in the post-production stage: Habit, Leave Not One Alive, Girl, and The Babysitter 2.",fake

1028,https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/2020/05/15/batteries-fading-rodents-ruining-engines-cars-left-neglected-coronavirus/111783932/,2020-05-15,"Batteries fading, rodents ruining engines as cars are left neglected during coronavirus","Hartford, Conn. — Car batteries are fading and ruinous rodents are colonizing engine compartments as the coronavirus keeps many cars parked at home.

Dead batteries prompted 40% of AAA’s calls for service in April, compared with 20% in April 2019, the organization’s Greater Hartford spokeswoman, Amy Parmenter, said.

“Some cars won’t last two weeks,” said Paul Hechenbleikner, manager of Jones’ Automotive Service in East Hartford.

Some vehicles draw more electrical power while parked with the engine off. Called “parasitic drain,” electrical current goes to engine computers and electronic control modules for power windows, mirrors and other accessories.

Also, older car batteries fizzle faster, said Don Cusson, owner of Cusson Automotive Inc. in South Windsor. Mechanics advise people to take a 20-minute cruise at least once a week to keep the battery charged.

Stationary autos also invite rodents seeking dry, warm places for nesting. The buck-toothed critters can cause costly horrors on wiring.

Connie Yan of Manchester said her car sat for about two weeks as she and her husband followed state guidelines and stayed home. One day last month, the couple decided to take a ride to ease cabin fever, but noticed warning lights for anti-lock braking and traction control systems.

Opening the hood revealed a retreating bushy tail and a huge nest next to the engine. Squirrels had chewed through wires, disabling some systems, and also had gnawed through a windshield washer spray hose, Yan said.

While removing the nest, the couple noticed something else — two baby squirrels that could hardly open their eyes. They placed the pair in a box on the ground with some of the nesting material so the mother could find them, she said.

After getting the car repaired, they sprayed diluted peppermint oil solution in a few spots to deter further visitors. People also use dryer sheets and mothballs to fend off squirrels, mice and chipmunks.

Hechenbleikner said he recently repaired squirrel damage on a car’s wiring harness. The bill was about $150, but that was cheap compared with the extensive damage he has seen in other vehicles.

Even as restrictions ease, many cars will not be rolling as they normally would for weeks or even months, so AAA advised owners to take the following steps:

If you won’t be driving your car at least once a week, a battery tender will maintain the charge.

Keep the gasoline tank at three-fourths or full. Full tanks help minimize condensation.

Check the tire pressure and fill, as needed, to the amount posted inside the driver’s door.

Despite virus-related repairs that some car owners need, Hechenbleikner and Cusson both said business is down and they have had to adjust their workforces.

“I try not to dwell on the figures,” Hechenbleikner said. “I don’t want to depress myself too much.”

Cusson said business at his 14-person shop has slowed 55%-60% and he had to cut technicians’ hours to 32 hours a week for four weeks. He did receive federal paycheck protection money and everyone is back to 40 hours a week, Cusson said, but the slowdown is still hurting.

But the shop also repairs motor homes, and Cusson said he feels confident that business will return as the pent-up longing to get back on the road is finally realized.

“This year, and there is no way around it, we will witness a historic economic downturn,” DIHK President Eric Schweitzer said when presenting the association’s latest survey of industrial companies.

The DIHK’s expectation for an economic plunge in the double-digit percentage range compares with the government’s forecast for a record contraction of 6.3% in 2020.

“German businesses are facing their biggest challenge since the end of World War Two,” Schweitzer said, adding that many industrial companies were facing massive liquidity problems.

The DIHK survey, conducted among some 10,000 industrial companies between May 4-6, showed three-quarters reported declining demand and 80% expected a substantial drop in sales.

Nearly 50% of German industrial companies are putting investments on hold and are planning to cut their budgets because of the coronavirus pandemic, it said.

Due to the disruptions caused by the outbreak in many countries across the globe, almost a fifth of German industrial companies are currently reorganising their supply chains, the survey showed.

“World market shares are currently being redistributed,” Schweitzer said.

DIHK trade expert Volker Treier said he expected German exports to decline by 15% this year, due to weaker demand from major export markets such as the United States.

For 2021, DIHK is expecting the economy to grow by roughly 5%, Schweitzer said.",real

Mexico’s culture secretary confirmed the singer’s death, but the Social Security Institute would not comment on local media reports saying he died Thursday of complications from COVID-19. A note on Chavez’s personal twitter account, signed by his staff, said he had been hospitalized Wednesday with symptoms of the disease caused by the coronavirus.

Chávez was best known for folk-style songs lampooning Mexico’s corrupt political elite. One such song was “La Casita” (“The Little House”), which described an imaginary politician’s mansion.

Culture Secretary Alejandra Frausto wrote in her Twitter account: “Thank you, Oscar Chávez, your life was journey worthy of you! My deepest sympathy to your relatives, friends and companions in struggle and song.”

Interior Secretary Olga Sánchez wrote: “I have learned to my deep regret that a voice of the struggle has been silenced. My deepest sympathy to the family of Oscar Chávez.”

Chávez sang ballads since the 1960s and played in public as recently as 2019.

Mexico has reported 19,224 confirmed coronavirus cases and 1,859 deaths.

Between 4.6 to 5.5 million people could be hospitalised under this scenario, severely straining limited health resources.

Nearly 250 million people could catch the novel coronavirus (COVID-19 aka SARS-CoV-2) across the African continent, with up to 190,000 of them dying if African countries don’t receive the support that they require. This is according to the latest peer-reviewed report by experts from the World Health Organization (WHO), due to be published soon in the British Medical Journal.

Dr Humphrey Karamagi is the Team Leader for Data, Analytics and Knowledge Management in the WHO Regional Office for Africa and co-authored this latest report.

Sputnik: How will non-African countries be affected if the African continent doesn't get the support it requires to avoid the worst-case scenario that your model predicts?

Dr Humphrey Karamagi: All countries of the world will be affected negatively. At present, WHO has said it anticipates the virus would be around the globe for a few years.

Africa may become a source of new infections for other regions of the world, just as other regions may be a source of new infections for Africa. The support to the African countries therefore needs to be part of the overall global response for all countries.

Sputnik: Your report says that previous predictive models have failed to adequately reflect the socio-ecological factors which are unique to many African countries.

What is different about your model that results in a more fair and accurate prediction of what we can expect to occur in Africa?

Dr Humphrey Karamagi: First, it takes into consideration new information about the epidemiology of SARS-Cov_2 infection, which the other models may not have had.

Second, it incorporates the information on how the infection interacts in the body to cause severe disease, particularly in relation to the elderly, and people with obesity, diabetes or are on hypertension management.

Third, it captures a wider range of socio-ecological factors influencing transmission, all of which country specific data is used to build country-specific models of transmission.

Sputnik: What must be done to avoid the worst-case scenarios of healthcare systems being overstretched due to the COVID-19 outbreak?

Dr Humphrey Karamagi: Effective public health measures focusing on the need to test, isolate, treat and quarantine suspected cases. The aim is to interrupt transmission enough to reduce the risk of infection to a level where a country can effectively respond to the cases its health system can manage. This will avoid unnecessary deaths and costs.

Sputnik: The African continent appears to have suffered less from COVID-19 compared to Europe, the US and parts of Latin America thus far.

Why is that? Could it be that a lack of sufficient testing is hiding the true figures of those who have contracted the virus?

Dr Humphrey Karamagi: There are a number of potential explanations:

First, it could be that Africa is still at the early phase of the pandemic that Europe and America went through given its lower rate of transmission postulated from the model. Cases are now increasing in countries where public health containment measures are not effective and reducing in countries where they are (like Mauritius, Eritrea).

Secondly, levels of testing are very low in some countries and many cases may not be detected. As seen in the rest of the world, it is important to have expansive testing in order to identify and respond to cases.

Sputnik: Is your model open source and can its assumptions and data can be scrutinised and evaluated?

Dr Humphrey Karamagi: Obviously it is, and has even been peer reviewed by independent experts. All countries have received and are using it through the WHO Country Offices.",fake

345,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/16/world/canada/montreal-nursing-homes-coronavirus.html,2020-04-16,31 Deaths: Toll at Quebec Nursing Home in Pandemic Reflects Global Phenomenon,"
MONTREAL — Thirty-one people were found dead in less than a month at a nursing home in Montreal, at least five confirmed to have coronavirus — a powerful Canadian emblem of how nursing homes are among the places hardest hit by the pandemic.
In the United States 17 bodies were recently discovered at a long-term care facility in New Jersey, among 68 deaths linked to the residence, 26 confirmed as coronavirus cases. And it was at a long-term care facility in Kirkland, in Washington state, that Americans first got a glimpse of the horrors to come after residents fell ill with Covid-19 in late February.
The phenomenon has been seen across Europe as well. In Spain, soldiers sent to disinfect nursing homes found people abandoned, or even dead, in their beds. Italy, Britain and France have acknowledged that their official statistics have overlooked many virus-related deaths in long-term care facilities.
The deaths in Canada were discovered late last week at Résidence Herron, a private home for seniors in Montreal, after the local health authority, alarmed by staff shortages and the spread of coronavirus at the home, took control of the residence.
They found dehydrated residents lying listless in bed, unfed for days, with excrement seeping out of their diapers.
“I’d never seen anything like it in my 32-year nursing career,” said Loredana Mule, a nurse on the team. “It was horrific — there wasn’t enough food to feed people, the stench could’ve killed a horse.”
After she left the home, she said, she collapsed in her car and wept.A skeleton staff of two nurses had been left to care for a private residence with nearly 150 beds, she said. The remaining staff had fled amid the outbreak of the coronavirus, leaving patients, some paralyzed or with other chronic illnesses, to fend for themselves.
In announcing the deaths on Saturday, François Legault, the premier of Quebec, said there appeared to be “gross negligence.”
The Montreal police, Quebec’s health ministry and the provincial coroner’s office have begun investigations into the home. Officers from Montreal police’s major crime unit have been sifting through evidence, confiscating files and interviewing employees.
Autopsies of the dead are also expected, though families of relatives said they feared they may never learn the truth about how many residents had died of the virus since many of the bodies had been cremated.
“How is it possible that so many body bags left that place and no one raised the alarm?” Ms. Mule asked.
After discovering the deaths at the Herron, Quebec’s ministry of health this week inspected 40 private homes for the elderly, and Mr. Legault called for volunteers to fill staffing gaps at residences. On Thursday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Quebec officials had asked the federal government for staffing help for its overwhelmed nursing homes.
Quebec is the Canadian province most severely affected by coronavirus, with 15,857 cases and 630 people dead. Health officials say retirement homes accounted for roughly half of the total deaths in Quebec.
Mr. Legault has blamed Herron’s management for the catastrophe, saying that after the residence was informed last month that a patient had tested positive for the virus, it refused to cooperate with the regional health authority, forcing it to obtain a court order and delaying intervention.
By the time a team of health care workers arrived on March 29, the coronavirus had already invaded.Résidence Herron is owned by a Quebec real estate company, Katasa, which owns six other retirement residences. A spokesman for the company declined to comment on allegations of negligence.
But Katherine Chowieri, whose father, Samir Chowieri, is president of Katasa and who is a manager at the company, denied negligence to local news outlets, telling them that she blamed the health authority for not heeding the residence’s calls for help as staff left amid a shortage of protective equipment.
On Tuesday, Patrizia Di Biase-Leone learned that her mother, Antonietta Pollice, who turned 97 on March 11 and suffers from dementia, had tested positive for the virus. She said the residence had obfuscated her mother’s condition, even as she suffered symptoms including diarrhea, dehydration and hallucinations.
“Of course, we are gravely concerned about our mom,” she said. “She is emaciated and losing the will to live. We are getting no cooperation. What do we do? Call the cops?”
The glossy website of Résidence Herron touts a nutritionist for personalized meal plans, a bistro cafe, a hairdresser and a full-time nursing staff for its elderly patients.
But families of residents said in interviews that, over several years, they had seen their relatives deprived of basic needs like diapers, exercise, proper hygiene and healthy meals, despite a monthly cost of between 3,000 and 10,000 Canadian dollars to stay there.
When the coronavirus spread to the residence, they said, they desperately struggled to get information about their loved ones, while their pleas to test their relatives for the virus were ignored.
This is not the first time the Herron’s services have come under scrutiny. Last year, a report by Quebec Health and Social Services warned that the home’s palliative care was lacking.
In 1981, Mr. Chowieri, the owner of Résidence Herron, was convicted of drug trafficking, serving about 15 months in prison. One year later he was convicted of fraud. In 1994, a seniors residence he owned was the subject of a money-laundering inquiry by the national police. And in 2002, he was fined $125,000 for tax evasion.
Frédéric Lepage, a spokesman for the company, said Samir Chowieri’s criminal record was expunged in 2014 due to good behavior.
Leane Conti, whose mother, Carole Stewart, 79, is partially paralyzed and was bedridden at Residence Herron for two years, said staff repeatedly refused to lift her mother off her bed to properly bathe her, leading to infections in her legs and feet.
She said she was chided by the residence that her mother was “urinating too much and using too many diapers.”
After her mother came down with a fever in late March and was sent to a nearby hospital, Ms. Conti said she finally learned from the hospital that there was a case of coronavirus at the residence.
Ms. Stewart was sent back to the Herron, where Ms. Conti said she wasn’t quarantined, pending test results. She has since tested positive and has been hospitalized.
“When I learned there were 31 bodies in less than a month at the Herron, I was shocked but not surprised,” she said.",real

Before the pandemic, a growing number of governments banned single-use plastic bags in an effort to cut down on waste. But as the novel coronavirus has spread around the globe, people have gotten leery about coming in close contact with other people and their possessions, including reusable bags. On March 31st, New Hampshire became the first state in the US to temporarily ban reusable bags during the pandemic.

“For whatever reason, people seem to get very fired up about grocery bags,” says Meghan May, a professor of microbiology and infectious disease at the University of New England College of Osteopathic Medicine. “Ordinarily I use [reusable bags] all the time because I live in a beach town and a clean ocean is really important,” May tells The Verge. But now she and many others are thinking twice.

There has been no evidence of reusable bags spreading the novel coronavirus

Like pretty much everything else right now, reusable bags should probably be handled more carefully to minimize the risk of transmitting disease to other people. At the same time, there has been no evidence so far that using reusable grocery bags have been responsible for spreading the novel coronavirus.

We don’t really know how long the novel coronavirus can persist on reusable bags. The best data experts have is from one study that found that the virus could stay viable on plastic for up to three days in lab conditions. (That means shoppers may want to be careful when handling disposable plastic bags, too, environmental advocates contend.) That research didn’t look into how the virus fares on fabric, so we can’t apply its findings directly to cloth bags, according to May.

Shoppers should still take precautions with reusable bags, despite the lack of data, May advises. “One would want to err on the side of caution here because we know [the virus] can survive on many different types of surfaces,” she says. “We should probably assume that it can be transmitted that way until someone demonstrates that it can’t.”

“Err on the side of caution.”

One way to stop the spread of germs is to wash reusable bags before and after each use. (That’s in addition to washing your hands before and after you go to the store, avoiding touching your face, wiping down baskets and carts, and bagging your own items.) Plastic and nylon bags can be cleaned with soap and water, then sprayed or wiped down with a diluted bleach solution or disinfectant, according to recommendations from North Carolina State University. Make sure to clean both the inside and outside of the bag and let them air dry before storing or using them, the university adds, and cloth bags can be washed like laundry, then they should be dried on the warmest setting.

But the virus could transfer quickly from one person to an item they’ve been in close contact with, like a bag, reusable or otherwise, May points out. If an infected person hands the bag to someone else, they risk passing along the virus. The person who faces the most risk, according to May, is the grocery store worker interacting with many customers throughout his or her shift. “They have to touch [the reusable bag], handle it and pack things into it, and then they have to then turn around and do that with the next customer that comes in their line,” May says. “The person at least risk is the person who owns the bag.”

That’s why some grocery stores and states are turning back to disposable bags: they simply aren’t handled quite as much, so there’s less uncertainty over where they’ve been.

But protecting public health doesn’t have to be at odds with efforts to stem the flood of plastics filling landfills and collecting in the ocean, environmental advocates say. “If stores, particularly workers, want to keep themselves as safe as possible and limit the bags coming in because they don’t know if people wash them, certainly a temporary pause on that, I think that’s understandable,” Ivy Schlegel, a senior research specialist for Greenpeace USA, says. But that “pause” shouldn’t be permanent, says Schlegel. She has followed the plastics industry’s history of fighting environmental reforms by claiming that reusable bags are unsanitary. She sees the industry seizing the opportunity now to push its own agenda.

A frequently cited 2011 study that found bacteria in seldom-washed reusable bags was actually underwritten by a fossil fuel and chemical industry group, the American Chemistry Council. It was cited in a March 18th letter that the Plastics Industry Association penned to the Department of Health and Human Services asking that the department “speak out against bans on [single-use plastic] products as a public safety risk.”

“Some people will call it disaster capitalism.”

“Some people will call it disaster capitalism,” says Schlegel. “Using this moment where everything is in chaos and people are legitimately concerned about public health to turn back the clock to go back to a world where plastic is the norm, rather than right now where reusables are becoming the norm in many places.”

The plastic pollution problem isn’t going away anytime soon. A plastic grocery bag adrift in the ocean can take up to 20 years to decompose. A plastic bottle could stick around for up to 450 years, according to estimates from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Less than 10 percent of all plastics have actually been recycled. The industry knew all along that recycling wouldn’t solve the environmental harms posed by plastic, but it continued to promote it as a viable solution anyway, according to a joint investigation by PBS Frontline and NPR published this week.

There are ways to limit plastic waste during the COVID-19 pandemic. May recommends simply carrying groceries straight from the basket or cart to your car if that’s possible. Paper bags are another alternative; they are still single-use, but at least they’re compostable. And Schlegel tells The Verge that one way to make reusable bags cleaner and more convenient in the future could be to implement municipal programs that pick up residents’ reusable bags, sanitize them, and then return them to stores for reuse. Those solutions might not be available everywhere during this pandemic, but they’re worth thinking about as we prepare for what comes next. In the long run, protecting public health and the planet usually go hand in hand.",real

Astronauts have been there, done that","Buy Photo Deana Weibel and husband Glen Swanson review a recent artice in 'Space Review' magazine.

When astronauts from NASA were first isolated in space, from 1961 to 1963 in Project Mercury, they were away from Earth on flights lasting from Alan Shepard Jr.’s 15 minutes to L. Gordon Cooper Jr.’s 34 hours.

But as the country reached for the moon, Project Gemini began requiring a far more burdensome, considerably extended period of social isolation, at a considerable physical distance.

Doctors and scientists say the efforts more than half a century ago may provide lessons for living through today's pandemic, when the major remedy is staying home to stay safe.

“In Gemini, you have guys in pairs being sent out for weeks at a time. And it was stressful,” said Deana Weibel, a professor of anthropology, at Grand Valley State University, whose research focus includes space exploration.

“One of the descriptions was that they were in a space about the size of the front seat of a VW Bug,” Weibel said.

“Very limited space, small couches, and you’re stuck like that for two weeks.

“So trying to get along with another person for that amount of time is probably better than being completely by yourself. But it is certainly something where by the time they landed, they were ready to get away from each other!” she said.

Weibel recently wrote a piece for The Space Review, a 17-year-old online publication, about social isolation in space. Among her conclusions: Even though a lot goes on in space, diversions are crucial for tolerating social isolation.

Schedules create structure, provide mental stimulation and break up the day.

And communication with others outside the bubble is a godsend. Whether it is the folks at Mission Control, the president of the United States or members of the family, who could sometimes pipe in. Especially during the flights later, in Project Apollo, hearing from others outside of the bubble helped astronauts maintain proper frames of mind.

“Al Worden, who is from Michigan, and who died just March 18, has the Guinness Book of World Records record for being the most isolated human being that’s ever existed,” Weibel said.

Worden, an astronaut and engineer born in Jackson who attended the University of Michigan, spent three days alone in the command module during the Apollo 15 mission in 1971, becoming the most socially distanced person, in history.

“When he was orbiting the moon, and David Scott and Jim Irving were on the surface of the moon, (he was) farther than anyone on Earth could possibly be from any other human on Earth,” she explained.

“And when he talks about it in his memoir, he dealt with it mostly just by staying really, really busy. They had an extremely rigid schedule that he was supposed to follow.

“He actually enjoyed the isolation, a bit, after being involved with the other guys for a while,” Weibel said.

A.W. “Tony” England, dean of the College of Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Michigan-Dearborn, is a former astronaut who served as mission scientist for Apollo 13 and 16 and space station program scientist from 1986 to 1987.

England said NASA draws on the history of exploration, which often involved extreme physical distancing and social isolation.

“What NASA did for the early scientist astronauts, seven us of which eventually flew in something, the way they approached us is that they had found in the military that establishing common experiences and understanding how teams have to work under pressure convinced them that the thing to do for us was to give us the same experiences,” he said.

“A submarine crew is out for months without contact outside of the submarine. In the old sailing ships, the whalers were gone for years, mostly at sea,” he said. “So there is a long history of people working in a strange environment, without access to family or access to normal recreation.”

While he had an eight-day space flight, England said, he also was in Antarctica with field teams, twice, for two-and-a-half months and only shortwave radio communication, “without seeing so much as a contrail.”

Unlike the coronavirus, which appeared suddenly and relentlessly for many people, without seeking volunteers, exploration — and the accompanying isolation — is often the fondest desire of those exploring.

Unlike COVID-19, astronauts and other explorers want to be where they are, and have trained.

“I guess my experience would say that people who would accept the challenge as something they really want to invest themselves in, really don’t have that much of a problem in extended living situations where it’s not normal life,” England said, of his varied experiences.

“The other thing that is really important in a situation like that is an understanding and an acceptance of your responsibilities,” he said.

Being isolated in close quarters with a unit of people places a premium on everyone knowing their roles and fulfilling them, in a spirit of teamwork.

“It was interesting. On our flight, the commander, Gordie Fullerton had been a test pilot of heavy airplanes, and so he was used to working with large crews,” England said. “It made it a delightful experience for us.

“Some of the commanders, who were from fighters or single-pilot airplanes, didn’t adjust to the idea of working with a crew. And their crews have come back down, you know, not really close friends.”

The astronauts' experiences, and the information culled from them, are of significant interest to doctors, especially at the Space Medicine Innovations Laboratory at the Geisel School of Medicine, at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire.

In the lab, doctors and scientist research behavioral approaches for people in confined spaces, to devise strategies for handling stress, depression and conflict that can come from confinement, not unlike those associated with a pandemic.

Especially pertinent in the time of coronavirus, the Dartmouth PATH Program provides a series of self-help tools designed for astronauts coping with confinement in small spaces for extended periods.

“Our work is focused on providing people with self-directed, anonymous tools that they can use, in the moment, to help them with these kinds of things,” said Dr. Jay Buckey, a professor of medicine at Dartmouth, director of the Space Medicine Innovations Lab, and a former astronaut.

“So they’re online. It’s at path.dartmouth.edu, and it’s a research project, so you have to sign a consent form.”

Mobile devices are not currently supported.

The program highlights coping with stress, depression and conflict in isolation and confinement.

“These are self-help tools,” said Buckey, a former astronaut. “The individual is doing the work. The tools offer practical things that people can do in any environment.”

Buckey flew aboard the space shuttle Columbia in 1998. He and research colleagues at Dartmouth, Harvard and UCLA developed the tools over more than decade.

“In the conflict area, it gives you some different ways to think about conflict,” he explained.

“Why is when you say something, people responded in a totally different way than you expected? You think you’re saying something really innocuous, and it gets a big response. It helps you understand, sometimes, what is going on there,” Buckey said.

“It also gives you some tips on being a good negotiator that keeps the relationship in mind. For a lot of us, now, being in isolation, where we're close to family and friends and roommates, people who we probably want to maintain or relationships with. But, we still got to negotiate things; we’re going to have some disagreements.

“So the inter-space negotiation is kind of a skill on how to do that better,” he said.

Glen Swanson, a former chief historian at the Johnson Space Center in Houston and a former physics instructor at Grand Valley State University, said the significant difference between space exploration and life in a time of pandemic is that NASA missions come with an end date.

“The crew members, they have a flight plan,” said Swanson, Weibel’s husband. “There is great comfort in knowing when this is going to be over.

“I know when I’m going to come back, I’m going to see my family and friends. I am prepared for this three-month, six-month stay, or whatever the duration, ahead of time.

“When I signed up for this gig in advance, I knew what was going to happen.”

COVID-19 is a different gig, Swanson said.

“The big difference here is we just don’t have that. We don’t have that splashdown. We don’t know when things are going to come to an end, and there’s a lot of uncertainty.

“And uncertainty is something that NASA tries to avoid.""

A full vote on the gift is expected soon.

The US unemployment rate now stands at 14.7 percent, the worst figure since records began. Nearly 39 million Americans have lost their jobs since the coronavirus reached US shores in late January, and the Congressional Budget Office warned on Tuesday that the US economy won’t recover from its current contraction until after next year. Moreover, the federal government’s financial relief packages to date have pushed national debt past a record $25 trillion.

You wouldn’t think there was anything wrong if you asked Senator Marco Rubio though. The Florida Republican and his colleagues on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee quietly approved a bill on Thursday to guarantee Israel a minimum of $38 billion in military aid over the next ten years, despite the economic shambles at home.

Passed unanimously, the bill now heads to the Senate floor for a full vote.

Though authored by Rubio – a Republican of hawkish persuasion – the bill aims to legally codify a promise made by former President Barack Obama in 2016. Under the terms agreed to by Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the Jewish state would not seek any additional funds beyond the annual $3.8 billion. Indeed, when Congress voted on an earlier version of Rubio’s bill in 2018, that figure was set as a cap. The 2018 bill was eventually rolled into another Middle East security bill the following year, which was left to die in the Democrat-controlled House.

spending cap has been removed. In the version passed by the Foreign Relations Committee on Thursday, the US will send “not less than” $3.3 billion in direct military aid and $500 million in funding for missile defense programs every year for the next decade.

Rubio boasted on Thursday that the bill “strengthens our nation’s strategic security alliance with Israel, a vibrant democracy that faces growing and unprecedented threats to its security and stability.” Yet the bill was passed with no fanfare, and in a state of near-secrecy.

The Foreign Relations Committee voted on it alongside a package of 15 other bills, with committee head Jim Risch (R-Idaho) foregoing the usual live-streaming of proceedings. Some of Risch and Rubio’s Democratic colleagues voiced concerns about the hush-hush nature of the session, but none objected to passing the bill, which amounts to the largest such aid package in American history.

The vote was not covered by American media, and was noted by only a few anti-Israel activists. Should the full Senate vote attract more coverage, it will likely draw some criticism. Even before the coronavirus hammered the US economy, support for Israel among the American public was falling. According to a Gallup poll taken late last year, 59 percent of Americans sympathized with Israel in the Middle East conflict, down from 64 percent a year earlier.

“Took a test the other day. And I found out that I have the antibodies,” the singer, 61, said in her latest Madame X-themed “Quarantine Diary” on Instagram Thursday.

“So tomorrow,” Madonna added, “I’m just going to go for a long drive in a car, and I’m going to roll down the window, and I’m going to breathe in, I’m going to breathe in the COVID-19 air. Yup. I hope the sun is shining.”

Antibody tests check antibodies in your blood to see if you were previously exposed to the virus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The federal agency says “a positive test result shows you have antibodies that likely resulted from an infection with SARS-CoV-2,” the virus that causes COVID-19.

Although Madonna may be ready to hit the road following her positive antibody test results, the CDC says it’s unclear if the antibodies will make you immune to the virus or prevent you from getting infected again.

Madonna captioned her quarantine diary with the hashtags #staysafe #staysane

“Here’s the good news,” she added on Instagram. “Tomorrow’s another day and I’m going to wake up and I’m going to feel differently.”

Last month, Madonna stirred controversy after calling the coronavirus ”the great equalizer.”

“That’s the thing about COVID-19,” she said “It doesn’t care about how rich you are, how famous you are, how funny you are, how smart you are, where you live, how old you are, what amazing stories you can tell. It’s the great equalizer.”

According to the singer, “what’s terrible” about the virus is also “what’s great about it.”

Like many artists in the entertainment industry, Madonna canceled the remainder of her tour, “Madame X,” over safety concerns last month.

HCQ is an antimalarial that is also used to treat autoimmune diseases such as lupus.

Those that received hydroxychloroquine with standard treatment were observed to have had a significantly shorter time to body temperature recovery of about one day as well as a significantly reduced time to cough remission of about a day compared to patients receiving only the standard treatment according to reports from Zhan Zhang, MD of Wuhan University.

A larger proportion of patients in the group receiving the hydroxychloroquine with standard treatment had improved pneumonia compared to those in the control group, according to a manuscript posted on the medRxiv preprint server.

Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have been getting much attention lately, and the FDA is looking into conducting randomized trials against COVID-19, it is worth noting that some hospital have begun using a cocktail of azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine to desperately ill patients on a compassionate care basis, and there are unconfirmed reports of some even using off label use of these agents.

Due to the attention the CDC has issued a warning to people against taking medications/remedies that they don’t understand as one unfortunate person died from ingesting chloroquine phosphate which is used to clean fish tanks, but thought it was the product getting all the attention in the media.

Previous trials exploring the in vivo activity of HCQ had found no benefit in clinical measures or viral clearance compared to standard care. The drug continues to be tested in trials including this randomized trial involving 62 hospitalized patients who were tested and confirmed to be infected with COVID-19. All patients received standard care including oxygen therapy, antiviral agents, antibacterial agents, and immunoglobulin with/without corticosteroids: those in the intervention groups also received 400 mg tablets of oral hydroxychloroquine sulfate per day on days 1-5.

Primary endpoint was time to clinical recovery which was defined as being the ""return to body temperature and cough relief, maintained for more than 72 [hours]."" The mean patient age was 45 and almost half were men, with no significant differences in the age and sex distribution between the groups according to the authors.

4 of the 62 patients in the control group were noted to progress to severe illness, and 2 patients reported having mild adverse reactions ( rash and headache) in the HCQ group. Those in the HCQ group had a one day shorter time to body temperature recovery and similar results were seen for time to cough remission.

Retinopathy is a known side effect from long term therapy with hydroxychloroquine which can often be seen in lupus patients who may remain on the drug for years. Those on long term use may also experience arrhythmias, gastrointestinal reactions, cramps, and liver dysfunction. Patients on hydroxychloroquine therapy should be monitored for adverse reactions, but according to Zhang and colleagues the ""short-term application of HCQ is relatively safe.""

The authors concluded that ""considering that there is no better option at present, it is a promising practice to apply HCQ to COVID-19 under reasonable management,” while also acknowledging there is still a need for large scale clinical trials and other research to clarify the treatment mechanisms and to optimize the treatment plan.

The U.K. will most likely fail to strike a new trade agreement with the European Union by the end of the year, analysts said, as the coronavirus crisis threatens to derail official trade talks.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has pledged to conclude a post-Brexit trade deal this year. The U.K., which left the bloc on Jan. 31, is in a transition phase until December. During the transition, it is working to establish trade arrangements with the 27-nation EU.

However, this timeline is now at risk after the two lead negotiators had to isolate due to Covid-19 infections.

""The pandemic has completely taken over the agenda in both the EU and in London, and relegated the Brexit talks to a secondary issue,"" Constantine Fraser, European political analyst at research firm TS Lombard, told CNBC on Thursday.

""It was always going to be difficult to reach an agreement in the limited time available this year. The pandemic means it will now be impossible.""

British and European negotiating teams held a call on Wednesday for the first time since both lead negotiators were forced to self-isolate.

The EU's negotiator, Michel Barnier, tested positive for the virus in March but he has now recovered. The U.K.'s Johnson announced he had also tested positive for the virus last month. He was discharged from hospital on April 12 after three nights in intensive care, and continues to recover.",real

The S&P 500 is up 23 percent from its March low.Wall Street resumed its rally on Wednesday. With a more than 3 percent gain, the S&P 500 is now up about 23 percent from its March 23 low.
The market has been steadily climbing since it hit that bottom, a rebound that began after the Federal Reserve and lawmakers in Washington took steps to protect the U.S. economy from a collapse amid the coronavirus pandemic. Stocks are still down about 19 percent from their late February high.
More recently, the gains have reflected hope that the peak of the pandemic in many cities is near, or already past. The growth rate of hospitalizations in hot spots like New York is slowing; China has lifted its lockdown of Wuhan, the city where the virus emerged; and governments in parts of Europe are making plans to do the same.
To some extent, the recent gains also reflect Wall Street’s fear of missing out on the rebound that many analysts predicted would eventually come.
“If you wait until the coast is clear, you will have missed a huge part of the gains,” said Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak a trading and asset management firm. “And professional investors can’t afford to do that.”
For now, though, it is big money managers — not mom-and-pop retail investors — who are in on the action. Hedge fund traders and mutual fund managers have swooped into the market, driving sharp gains for blue-chip shares that have been battered by the market sell-off.
Still, the market’s recent optimism is set against a grim backdrop of economic and human catastrophe that continues to play out — and which threatens to undercut any rally at a moment’s notice.
In Europe, data released on Wednesday showed that Germany and France, the largest economies in the region, were heading toward their sharpest downturns since World War II.
There’s more data to come. A new report on weekly jobless claims on Thursday is certain to show millions more Americans are out of work. The two prior reports recorded more than 10 million claims for unemployment in late March.
Investors go shopping: “We will never get these prices again.”
After a 3.4 percent rise on Wednesday, the S&P 500 has bounced 23 percent from its low in a disastrous March, despite a darkening outlook for economic growth and corporate profits.
One reason: It’s the time to buy for investors able to stomach the market’s swoons.Cole Smead, a portfolio manager at the Smead Value Fund, has been snapping up bargains in beaten-up parts of the market, like oil and energy producers, homebuilders and shopping-mall companies, that are closely tied to short-term swings in the economy.
“We will never get these prices again,” said Mr. Smead, whose fund has $1.3 billion in assets.As economically damaging as the pandemic will no doubt be, Wall Street is starting to see a path forward that wasn’t clear a few weeks ago. Slowing infection rates, hefty government relief packages and the Federal Reserve’s efforts to calm the markets have helped eased investors’ minds.
Some of the buyers are opportunistic hedge fund traders and mutual fund managers, driving sharp gains for blue-chip shares that were battered by the market sell-off. Some are traders feeling pressure to get into a rising market. And some are short-sellers forced to buy to minimize their own losses.
But mom-and-pop investors have largely been sitting out — a sign that the rally doesn’t reflect widespread optimism.
WeWork skips rent payments as it seeks to renegotiate better deals.
WeWork has not made scheduled rent payments to the landlords of some of the buildings where it operates its co-working spaces, according to a person briefed on the situation.
The decision to hold back rent is part of WeWork’s efforts to renegotiate better deals with building owners as the company tries to cut costs and limit its losses. WeWork’s executive chairman, Marcelo Claure, said in December that the company would try to get better terms from landlords, but the economic swoon caused by the coronavirus pandemic has made the task more urgent.
“Rather than implementing a company-wide policy on rent payments, we are individually reaching out to our more than 600 global landlord partners to work in good faith towards finding asset-specific solutions that benefit all parties involved,” WeWork said in a statement.
The person briefed on the situation said WeWork was seeking to renegotiate leases around the world, not just in the United States.
The Wall Street Journal first reported that WeWork was skipping rent payments.The virus outbreak has emptied many of WeWork’s locations and may reduce demand for its space over the longer terms. Seeing the empty spaces, landlords might be persuaded to reduce WeWork’s lease payments, but they also know that SoftBank, the company’s dominant shareholder, committed billions of dollars to finance WeWork’s expansion.
With hospitals in dire straits, insurance companies are speeding up payments.In a sign of just how desperate hospitals and doctors are for cash during the coronavirus pandemic, insurance companies, notorious for slow-walking their payments to health care providers, are now speeding up how quickly they pay.
“There was a universal cry for cash,” said Paul Markovich, the chief executive of Blue Shield of California, which said it would advance up to $200 million in payments to hospitals and doctors.
With revenues down for surgeries and other care not viewed as essential, providers are scrambling for money to pay for protective equipment and other supplies. “The pressure on the entire health care ecosystem is something I’ve never seen before,’‘ said Mr. Markovich, who hopes to get out the first payments as soon as this week.
“We’re effectively advancing payment now and collecting later,” he said, even as it is also working with customers about letting them delay paying premiums.
UnitedHealth, which owns one of the nation’s largest insurance companies, said it would also take a series of steps, like waiving the need for pre-authorization when patients see a new doctor or go to a skilled nursing facility, that should result in nearly $2 billion in payments getting in the hands of providers more quickly. Providers could be paid in a matter of days rather than several weeks.
United also announced it would be making $125 million available in small-business loans to medical groups that work with its Optum unit, which provides consulting and other services.
Highmark, a Blue Cross plan in Pittsburgh, said it was advancing more than $30 million to primary care doctors, who have been particularly hard hit as many patients have decided to forgo face-to-face doctors’ visits.
Another way to see the recession: Power usage is way down.New data on electricity use suggest that U.S. economic activity probably declined more over the past three weeks than it did during the entire year and a half of the Great Recession. It may already be the deepest downturn since the Great Depression; it is certainly the fastest.
These numbers are important because our official statistics cannot keep pace with the abrupt economic changes the coronavirus shutdown has caused. All those closed stores, silenced factories and darkened office buildings are yet to be counted in the government’s official economic numbers, which take months to collect, process and report.
But evidence of the sharp economic shift shows up in a large and rapid decline in electricity usage over recent weeks.
Food banks are squeezed by rising hunger and dwindling resources.
Demand for food assistance in the United States is surging, as millions of Americans find themselves out of work and school closures mean that many families who counted on them for free or subsidized meals need to turn elsewhere.
The rise in need is coming just as food banks face shortages of both donated food and volunteer workers.
It’s a nationwide phenomena:At Food Bank for the Heartland in Omaha, the amount of food donated for March dropped by nearly half. The food bank typically purchases $73,000 of food in a month this time of year but has spent $675,000 in the past four weeks.In Jonesboro, Ark., after a powerful tornado struck, a food bank received less than half the donations it expected because nervous families held on to what they had.In Washington State and Louisiana, the National Guard has been called in to help pack food boxes and ensure that the distributions run smoothly.Feeding America, the nation’s largest network of food banks, with more than 200 affiliates, has projected a $1.4 billion shortfall in the next six months alone.“I’ve never seen anything like it,” said Stacy Dean, vice president for food assistance policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research organization in Washington. She has studied food security for more than a quarter century. “People love the phrase ‘the perfect storm,’” she added, “but nothing is built for this.”
Europe’s biggest economies brace for the sharpest drop since World War II.
Europe’s pandemic-induced lockdowns were widely expected to throw the continent into a deep recession. Germany and France, the largest economies, said on Wednesday that they were headed toward their sharpest downturns since World War II, a warning that showed just how bad it’s about to get.
France officially slid into a recession after suffering one of the worst quarterly contractions in more than 50 years. Growth tumbled an estimated 6 percent from January to April, from the fourth quarter, the central bank said. For every two weeks the population remains under confinement, the economy shrinks by at least 1.5 percent, it added.
And Germany is sliding toward its deepest recession on record, with growth expected to plunge almost 10 percent from April through June, five leading economic institutes said Tuesday.

The company’s president and chief executive, Bill Nash, will forgo half of his salary, and the company’s senior leadership will take an unspecified reduction in pay.The Walt Disney Company has been badly battered by the pandemic, with its theme parks closed and movies postponed, but the company on Wednesday offered an upbeat update on its nascent streaming service: Disney Plus has passed 50 million paid subscribers worldwide in just five months of operation. Before its November introduction, analysts had predicted that Disney Plus would take a full year to sign up half that many subscribers. A hit series, “The Mandalorian,” has greatly increased demand. The pandemic has likely also helped, with parents looking for ways to entertain homebound children.Nordstrom, one of the country’s best-performing department stores, said in a regulatory filing on Wednesday that it did not have a “firm date” on when its stores would reopen. Most of the company’s work force — about 69,000 people, according to a separate filing — has been furloughed “or assigned zero hours of work.” Nordstrom has also temporarily closed its headquarters in Seattle.Amazon said it planned to pause a pilot program that shipped products for sellers on its marketplace in a bid to ease the pressures on its logistics operations, which are stretched thin by the surge in online shopping. The program, called Amazon Shipping, picked up packages that were already packed and labeled from a seller’s warehouse and then delivered them using Amazon’s delivery network.

I shouldn’t admit this, because age discrimination for older women searching for work, as I now am, is real. This makes me, at 54, one of the oldest of the Gen Xers. Like many in my generation, I have spent the past 32 years hopping over the Frogger logs of an unforgiving gig economy. The sociologist Allison Pugh has dubbed this the “tumbleweed society,” in which “job insecurity is rampant and widely seen as inevitable.” If COVID-19 can be said to have any upsides, it is that its devastating economic ravages have finally unmasked the truth of late-stage American capitalism: It is a system in which every worker is as expendable as every shareholder is sacrosanct.

At 3 p.m., having regained my composure, I clicked on the Zoom link. A Doom link, I thought, as my image appeared vertically between the CEO’s and our head of HR’s. In Brady Bunch terms, I’d be Alice, my boss would be Carol, and our head of HR would be Mike.

Read: Notes from a videochat memorial

“I’m so sorry,” my boss said. Her eyes watered anew. She had made this same call several times over the course of that day: seven times out of a staff of 44, so a 16 percent reduction in headcount. Many of us let go that day were among the higher earners, meaning our loss would allow more runway for the company than if they’d dismissed those earning less. In the end, with venture-capital belts tightening and deals falling through left and right because of the virus, the company’s survival was all about runway. I understood this, even if it pained me to accept it.

“I’m so sorry, too,” I said, choking back my own tears. “But this is an unprecedented time, and I get it. Are you okay? I’m worried about you.”

Hyper-empathy, my last shrink once labeled this propensity of mine to avoid my own pain by over-identifying with the pain of others: a trait that is simultaneously both self-protective and self-destructive. Were we not in a pandemic, I might have fought harder. Been angrier. Demanded more severance. Then again, were the economy not evaporating, I would not have been laid off. I had to keep reminding myself of this fact. Plus I was being offered the chance to keep working on a contract basis, with reduced hours, so I am in better shape than most. “When this pandemic is over, do you imagine me coming back as a full-time employee?” I asked.

Absolutely, my boss said. Her pained expression was hurting me. In fact, being fired over Zoom, without the normal visual cues and eye contact of in-person communication, only magnified the surreality of the moment. I found the whole experience of managing the disembodied pain of others emotionally draining. “Zoom fatigue,” it’s been dubbed, this simulacrum of human interaction in which we’re all now living. Had the three of us been sitting in a room in person while I was getting fired, instead of floating along as lifeless pixels on a screen, the pain I knew each of us was feeling in that moment—yes, even our head of HR, who spoke touching words about my work and value—might have seemed equally shared. Instead it felt as if I was taking it all on myself.",real

by Alliance for Natural Health

Many COVID drugs are failing. Natural medicine may hold the key—but can government cronyism be overcome? Action Alert!

A large analysis has found that antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine had no benefit for COVID patients, causing more deaths than standard care. Other pharmaceutical treatments are also turning out to be useless. Emerging evidence suggests that natural medicines like zinc, quercetin, and potassium could help, sometimes in conjunction with drugs, but the government refuses to acknowledge these benefits because nutrients aren’t as profitable for drug companies.

While hydroxychloroquine may be ineffective on its own, there are trials that have combined the drug with zinc. Zinc inhibits viral activity, but it is difficult to get high levels of zinc into cells. Hydroxychloroquine may help by aiding zinc’s entry into cells. Studies show quercetin may also do what chloroquine does with zinc but without toxic side effects. Some researchers believe that zinc in general is one of the most important things we can take both to avoid Covid-19 infection and treat it. Hydroxychloroquine comes with the usual laundry list of dangerous side effects, while quercetin could help prevent heart damage along with many other benefits.

Research indicates that many other natural medicines could help prevent or treat COVID-19.

It is known that big viruses rapidly exhaust potassium levels, which can be fatal. A Chinese study has confirmed this for Covid-19.

Some states, like Texas, have already seen a surge in new cases.

But it's still too early to draw definitive conclusions about the effects of loosened restrictions, since data on confirmed cases and deaths lags behind the on-the-ground reality.

These interactive charts show how many new COVID-19 cases are being reported daily in 20 states.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Across the US, 30 states have relaxed aspects of their stay-at-home orders and allowed certain businesses to reopen, hoping the worst is behind them. Meanwhile, 18 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and Guam remain under lockdown.

Public-health experts have repeatedly warned that lifting lockdowns too early could lead to more waves of coronavirus transmission, which could force states to implement new lockdowns to curb the virus' spread.

Some states have already seen cases spike. Less than two weeks after its stay-at-home order expired, Texas reported its largest daily increase in new coronavirus cases and deaths. Others states, including Florida and Georgia, eased restrictions in recent weeks even though case numbers weren't declining, but have seen them hold relatively stable so far. States like New York and Washington, where outbreaks hit earlier and lockdowns are still in effect, have reported steady declines in new cases.

However, we don't yet have definitive answers as to how states' decisions to loosen restrictions are impacting their outbreaks. That's because new case data can lag several weeks behind what's actually happening — people who get COVID-19 take an average of five days to develop symptoms, then may need to wait multiple days for test results. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has estimated that numbers we see today reflect infections that occurred about two weeks ago.

In states that aren't doing extensive testing, many cases might also not show on public health officials' radars at all.

Still, based on our best current information, here's what the progression of new cases reported each day looks like in 20 US states that have had significant COVID-19 outbreaks.",real

The findings echo smaller studies of patients in New York and Europe.

Patients who took the drugs were more likely to die in the hospital, the researchers found. While that may be due in part to the likelihood that those medicines were given to patients who were sicker, the authors of the study estimated that the excess risk ranged from 34 to 45 percent.

However, the study’s authors pushed for urgent randomized, controlled trials, saying it’s not possible in an observational study to exclude the possibility that other factors were responsible for the apparent link between survival rate and these drugs.

People taking hydroxychloroquine in combination with an antibiotic appeared to have the highest increased risk of heart rhythm complications, the study found.

Chloroquine is approved for malaria, and hydroxychloroquine for autoimmune diseases like Lupus; the authors said the study does not suggest those patients should stop taking the drugs as prescribed.

The FDA issued an emergency authorization for use in coronavirus patients in late March , but has since received criticism for doing so given the scant evidence the drugs worked.

MADISON, Wis. – Gov. Evers’ Safer at Home order recognizes outdoor activity as essential. As such, the 2020-2021 Game Fish season will proceed as planned opening on May 2. All regulations and license requirements apply. The DNR reminds anglers to fish close to home and practice social distancing whether fishing from a boat, dock, or shoreline. It is recommended that only anglers living in the same household should fish within six feet of one another.

All state parks are reopening Friday, but there are updated hours for operation of parks. Here are the details:

Regular fishing rules and regulations apply for all DNR properties. DNR boat launches within open state parks are open. However, all state parks have updated hours of operation from 6:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. and will be closed on Wednesdays. Anglers who want to fish within a state park on Wednesdays may still do so that day. All restrooms, water fountains, buildings, and facilities are also closed at all state parks.

However, all visitor centers, dog parks, latrines and water fountains will remain closed through the duration of the stay-at-home mandate’s extension, which now ends May 30. All public programs, rentals and non-district events have been canceled through May 30. Because the Monee Reservoir visitor center/concessions building is closed, there will be no boat rentals until further notice. These closures and cancellations will remain in effect to help stop the spread of the new coronavirus, which could overwhelm healthcare institutions and cause more deaths. Once parking lots reopen May 1, people should not be congregating in the preserves and at trailheads, which could spread COVID-19. It may be necessary to temporarily close sites where social distancing is not being maintained.

But despite the staggering job losses, the stock market has climbed well off its recent lows.

While this may seem confusing, here's the deal: Investors think April was the low point for the economy and things could start to improve — or at least not get worse — from here.

April was the worst month for job losses in the history of the US.

More Americans lost their jobs last month than during the entire financial crisis from 2007 to 2009 — or during any downturn in the past 80 years.

Andy Kiersz / Business Insider

Our official unemployment rate is now 14.7%, the highest since the Great Depression. Moreover, as Insider's Carmen Reinicke explains, this rate counts only people who are actively looking for work and not finding it, so it most likely is a significant undercount, as it excludes the Americans who want to be working but aren't even looking.

Andy Kiersz / Business Insider

The ""employment to population"" ratio also dropped to a record low. Only about half of Americans — 51% — are employed right now. The peak of this measure was about 64% in 2000.

7.7 million restaurant, bar, and hotel workers lost their jobs.

2.5 million health-services and education workers lost their jobs.

2.1 million retail and store workers lost their jobs.

And so on.

The only bright spot is that about 18 million of the 20.5 million job losses are considered temporary. At least for now, these folks think they'll be rehired when the economy improves.

This devastating jobs report raises a reasonable question that has come up often in the past few weeks:

Why, in the face of this economic and social calamity, is the stock market going up?

Back in February and early March, as the pandemic ravaged one industry after another, the stock market plunged by a third in five weeks.

Since then, the news has seemed to have only gotten worse.

And yet, since bottoming in mid-March, the stock market has risen steadily. Now, six weeks later, it has recovered about two-thirds of its losses and is not far below its all-time high.

So what gives?

Well, first, stock prices generally reflect investors' assessments about the future, not the past. As horrific as the economic news has been over the past six weeks, it has actually been better than some investors expected it might be back in mid-March.

Some economists, moreover, believe that we've already experienced the worst of the impact of the pandemic and that the economy will improve from here.

Second, the government's fast, aggressive financial response to the crisis — in the form of emergency aid packages from the Treasury and Congress and emergency liquidity from the Federal Reserve — has significantly limited the potential economic damage.

The government aid packages haven't saved all jobs (by a long shot), and they won't save all US businesses, but they've helped save a lot.

In fact, one of Wall Street's best economists, Jan Hatzius of Goldman Sachs, estimates that the various forms of government aid — including enhanced unemployment benefits — will actually more than offset the income Americans have collectively lost this year. This aid will not be shared equally, so there will still be plenty of individual pain, but, in aggregate, a lot of the economy's consumer spending should be maintained.

Goldman Sachs

Last of all, the market has done well because many of the most valuable companies in the index have been shielded or actually even benefitted from the crisis.

The Charles Schwab strategist Liz Ann Sonders notes that more than half of the value of the S&P 500 comes from companies in the tech, healthcare, and communications-services industries. These companies have done fine or even well in the past few months.

The so-called FANG+ companies, moreover — Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google, Microsoft, and other internet giants — make up a bigger percentage of the market than ever before. And they have collectively risen.

So, in short, for now, the reason the stock market is rising is that some investors believe we've seen the worst of the impact and that the situation will improve from here.

Other investors, meanwhile, think there's more bad news to come and those hoping for a quick recovery will be disappointed. The most famous investor on the planet, Warren Buffett, appears to be in this camp.

Which investors are right?

We'll see. No one has a crystal ball, and the endless challenge of trying to make better predictions than other investors is one reason the stock market is so fascinating.

In the meantime, our sympathies to the tens of millions of Americans who have lost their jobs in this crisis. We all hope that the optimists are right, that the worst is over, and that we can rebuild our economy quickly from here.

France is planning on auctioning 5G frequencies to telecoms companies at the end of the summer. However, Martin Bouygues, head of the eponymous communications firm, now thinks that bidding should be pushed back to the end of the year at the earliest.

“We need to push back the auction date simply because the economic world today is not the same as it was early March, when the terms of the auction were set,” he told Le Figaro on Saturday, adding that holding a bidding war while France recovers “with difficulty from a terrible human health and economic health nightmare” is “not the priority of the country.”

Bouygues is not an opponent of the technology. Indeed, his firm has already secured a 50 megahertz block, as have rivals Orange, Free, and SFR.

His opposition to the auction likely stems from the fact that France is currently facing an economic recession, with growth expected to drop by eight percent this year after an extended and nationwide lockdown. As such, the return on his investment simply wouldn’t be as large as it would have been pre-pandemic.

However, Bouygues also noted that the rollout of 5G technology has come in spite of growing public mistrust.

Aside from claims that Chinese firms like Huawei could use 5G hardware to relay secrets to the government in Beijing – pushed by the Donald Trump administration in Washington and denied by Huawei and China – 5G has become a target for conspiracy theorists the world over. Fueled by some lingering uncertainties over the potential health consequences of 5G’s short wavelength transmissions, skeptics have claimed that 5G masts can trigger anything from cancer to Covid-19.

Some of the more radical among these conspiracy theorists directly blame these broadcasting masts for causing the coronavirus in the first place, despite the lack of evidence to support their claims. 5G towers erected in the Netherlands and UK have been set on fire by activists, with British protesters going as far as spitting on and attacking the telecoms engineers installing the masts.

The situation is the same outside Europe too. Arson attacks on 5G infrastructure have been reported in Australia and New Zealand, while the US Department of Homeland Security warned last week that online “misinformation campaigns” have “already prompted arson and physical attacks against cell towers in several US states.”

407,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/22/health/cats-pets-coronavirus.html,2020-04-22,Two Cats Are First U.S. Pets to Test Positive for Coronavirus,"
The first pets in the United States, two cats from New York State, have tested positive for the virus that is causing the worldwide pandemic, the Agriculture Department and the Centers for Disease Control announced Wednesday.
The cats, from different parts of the state, are showing only mild symptoms and are expected to be fine.
Testing positive does not mean the cats have the same illness that people have. Nor does it mean that the cats can pass on the illness to people. And tests for pets are not the same as those for people, so no humans missed out on testing because the cats were tested.
Veterinarians took samples from both cats that were tested at a private lab. The test results were then confirmed at a national veterinary lab. The owners brought both cats to veterinarians because they showed symptoms of a respiratory infection. One owner had tested positive for the virus. No human in the other cat’s household tested positive.
Other cats have tested positive for the virus, SARS-CoV-2, including a pet in Belgium and a tiger at the Bronx zoo. After the tiger who showed mild symptoms tested positive, the zoo collected fecal samples from other big cats and found that a total of five tigers and three lions had been infected. One of the tigers didn’t show any symptoms. All of the big cats are doing well, the zoo reported Wednesday.
In an experiment in China, cats were shown to be susceptible to infection with the coronavirus, showing mild symptoms. The researchers said the experiment also showed that cats could pass the virus to other cats. But that was in a laboratory setting. The virus was detected by tests done after the cats had been euthanized. The researchers noted in the paper, “It was difficult to perform regular nasal wash collection on the sub-adult cats because they were aggressive.”
The Agriculture Department and the C.D.C. emphasized that “there is no evidence that pets play a role in spreading the virus in the United States.” Other experts agree that people should not start looking at their cats with suspicion. If anything, it’s the other way around.
Karen Terio, the chief of the Zoological Pathology Program at University of Illinois’s veterinary college, where the Bronx Zoo tiger sample was tested, noted that hundreds of thousands of people have tested positive in the United States, as opposed to two cats.
Dr. Terio said that while the tests and the earlier experiments did show that cats appear to be somewhat susceptible to the virus, “If this was going to be a serious problem for cats, we would have seen greater numbers.” Either very few cats are being infected, or their symptoms are so mild that their owners don’t notice them or think they warrant a trip to the vet. The direction of infection “is not going to be cat to human,” she said. “It’s going to be us to our pets. Thankfully, they’re having very mild disease.”
For now, the C.D.C. recommends keeping cats indoors to prevent them from contact with other animals or people. And for people who become sick, they recommend, as they have in the past, isolating from pets as much as possible, treating them as you would a human being in your family.
Dogs are less susceptible to infection with the virus, according to the same research paper on cats. Although there is some evidence that they may have low-level infections, they haven’t shown any symptoms. Nonetheless, the C.D.C. recommends that you put dogs on a six-foot leash when walking them, keep them away from other animals and avoid contact as much as possible with any pets if you are sick. The American Veterinary Medical Association has the same advice, which did not change with the new announcement.
The Agriculture Department will post any confirmed tests of animals with SARS-CoV-2 on its website. It does not recommend routine testing for pets.",real

Let the Facts Speak,"In Brief The Facts: A CNN reporter was seen taking off her mask after a White House Press conference, and is being accused of doing so because the camera's were off.

Reflect On: Are masks even necessary? Are we being told it's for our best health interests, just like we were told quarantine is/was, or is there some other agenda at play here?

The question is, how much do the people telling us to take certain precautions actually believe in what they tell us? A few months ago, models of the new coronavirus were predicting millions of deaths in multiple countries. These models were used and pushed by many federal health regulatory agencies as well as the World Health Organization(WHO). Independent scientists, epidemiologists and doctors all around the world started to publish papers and take to their social media platforms emphasizing that these early models and predictions were absolutely ridiculous, and do nothing but cause unnecessary fear and hysteria.

Special note to our followers: Is 5G safe? Learn the unbiased truth and the steps to implement better solutions in your community at the 5G Health Summit. It’s a free worldwide call to action from the leading independent experts, scientists and doctors in the field. You can sign up here.

What’s worse is that these models were the reasoning behind the quarantine and lockdown that many governments ordered their citizenry into. These lockdown and quarantine measures have also been heavily criticized by those in the field, leading many to believe that the ‘powers that be’ have made and are making the new coronavirus seem much more dangerous than it actually us. This was also complimented by various politicians as well as NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, who recently expressed that governments are using this pandemic to push more authoritarian measures on the citizenry. Information has even surfaced suggesting that the number of deaths attributed to the coronavirus is not accurate, and that people who have died of other causes have been listed as a coronavirus death, thus inflating the numbers.

If you want to read more of our articles diving into the examples given above, you can refer to the list of articles at the bottom of this one.

Government epidemiologist Neil Ferguson was behind the original prediction of millions of deaths as a result of the new coronavirus. Those original models are now coming under fire, the predictions by Ferguson’s models have just been branded the “most devastating software mistake of all time” and many are questioning why the UK government failed to get get a second opinion before accepting the Imperial College’s Covid modelling.

Ferguson co-founded the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis, based at Imperial, in 2008. It is the leading body advising national governments on pathogen outbreaks. It gets tens of millions of dollars in annual funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and works with the UK National Health Service, the US Centres for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC), and is tasked with supplying the World Health Organization with “rapid analysis of urgent infectious disease problems.”

These are the organizations and agencies that control human consciousness. A lot of the time what they put out, recommend and warn of is simply believed and trusted by the masses without questioning. Hopefully the new coronavirus issue will serve as yet another example of why these entities can’t be trusted.

Ferguson was one of many government scientists urging quarantine and lockdown. Yet he was caught not following his own suggestions. This begs the question, did Ferguson really believe the message that he was beaming out to the masses? Do the WHO and other federal health regulatory agencies really believe it? Are certain people being pressured to recommend these measures and put them into place? If it was the right thing to do, why would so any independent scientists question it right away? Why are social media platforms banning all narratives that go against the mainstream media narrative? Why are they banning any content related to the coronavirus that contradicts the WHO? What is going on here? Why are people like Julian Assange in jail? Why are people who expose war crimes punished and those who commit them followed by the masses? Is the coronavirus being used for ulterior motives, just like the “war on terror” has been used to infiltrate other countries under the guise of good will?

As a result of these criticisms and narratives/information that go against the official narrative, a digital authoritarian Orwellian “fact-checker” started to patrol the internet like never before, and still is. What does it say about our world when the leading scientists in this field who have been studying viruses for decades, along with doctors and other world renowned scientists are banned and censored from social media platforms for simply sharing their expert opinions and research just because they go against the official narrative that’s beamed out by the WHO and mainstream media networks? Should people not have the right to examine information, sources, evidence, research, opinions and determine for themselves what is, and what isn’t instead of having a digital “fact-checker” do it for them?

I’m not big on politics, but I am big on exposing the corrupt hand that uses politicians like puppets and powers above government that seem do dictate major government policy and the actions that are taken when it comes to major global geopolitical issues. That being said, I do scroll twitter feeds every now and again just to see what’s up, and in doing so I came across this recent tweet by Donald Trump.

It shows a CNN journalist immediately taking off her mask after the conference is over, obviously thinking that the camera’s were off and the live stream was over. Her name is Kaitlan Collins, and she responded by saying “Nearly 90,000 Americans have been killed by coronavirus, and the president is tweeting about me pulling my mask down for six seconds on Friday.”

Anytime somebody mentions the death toll, I feel it’s important to emphasize that there is a lot of evidence making it clear that the death numbers attributed to the new coronavirus seem to have been inflated, and that it’s probably not nearly that much. You can refer to that evidence in the articles posted below this one, as I go into more detail on that specific subject.

Why would she do this. Is it all for show? Does she really believe that a mask does anything at all to protect people? Are the people who were creating mass fear and hysteria at the beginning of this pandemic still doing so, and do masks play a role in that? Is this really about our health and safety or is it about something else?

Does A Mask Do Anything?

How effective are they? According to Dr. Dan Erickson (former emergency-room physician) and Dr. Artin Massihi (emergency medicine specialist affiliated with multiple hospitals) of Accelerated Urgent Care in California, they’re not helping at all.

When you wear gloves that transfer disease everywhere, those gloves have bacteria all over them. “I’m wearing gloves,” not helping you…Your mask that you’re wearing for days, you touch the outside of it, COVID, and then touch your mouth, this doesn’t make any sense. We wear masks in an acute setting to protect us, we’re not wearing masks (right now). Why is that? Because we understand microbiology, we understand immunology and we want strong immune systems. I don’t want to hide in my home, develop a weak immune system, and then come out and get disease. We’ve both been to the ER through swine flu and through bird flu, did we shut down for those? Were they much less dangerous than COVID? Is the flu less dangerous than COVID? Let’s look at the death rates, no it’s not. They’re similar in prevalence and in death rate. (source)

According to a study published in BMJ Open in 2015,

This study is the first RCT of cloth masks, and the results caution against the use of cloth masks. This is an important finding to inform occupational health and safety. Moisture retention, reuse of cloth masks and poor filtration may result in increased risk of infection. Further research is needed to inform the widespread use of cloth masks globally. However, as a precautionary measure, cloth masks should not be recommended for HCWs, particularly in high-risk situations, and guidelines need to be updated. We have provided the first clinical efficacy data of cloth masks, which suggest HCWs should not use cloth masks as protection against respiratory infection. Cloth masks resulted in significantly higher rates of infection than medical masks, and also performed worse than the control arm. The controls were HCWs who observed standard practice, which involved mask use in the majority, albeit with lower compliance than in the intervention arms. The control HCWs also used medical masks more often than cloth masks. When we analysed all mask-wearers including controls, the higher risk of cloth masks was seen for laboratory-confirmed respiratory viral infection.

According to the study, it was unclear if they help at all, and that they probably need to be worn at all times in acute/dangerous settings within the hospital to be effective at all.

There are also other potential health consequences of wearing not just a cloth mask, but also medical masks. The physiological effects of breathing elevated inhaled CO 2 may include changes in visual performance, modified exercise endurance, headaches and dyspnea. The psychological effects include decreased reasoning and alertness, increased irritability, severe dyspnea, headache, dizziness, perspiration, and short-term memory loss. (source)

This study suggests that masks don’t really help, and depending on the material, they can actually make things worse. That being said, there are studies suggesting that medical masks are indeed effective, but the studies are referring to health care workers in acute settings, not the general public.

Below is a quote from a very interesting paper published in 2016, titled “The Surgical Mask Is A Bad Fit For Risk Reduction.”

As represented by our cinema and other media, Western society expects too much of masks. In the public’s mind, the still-legitimate use of masks for source control has gone off-label; masks are thought to prevent infection. From here, another problem arises: because surgical masks are thought to protect against infection in the community setting, people wearing masks for legitimate purposes (those who have a cough in a hospital, say) form part of the larger misperception and act to reinforce it. Even this proper use of surgical masks is incorporated into a larger improper use in the era of pandemic fear, especially in Asia, where such fear is high. The widespread misconception about the use of surgical masks — that wearing a mask protects against the transmission of virus — is a problem of the kind theorized by German sociologist Ulrich Beck. The birth of the mask came from the realization that surgical wounds need protection from the droplets released in the breath of surgeons. The technology was applied outside the operating room in an effort to control the spread of infectious epidemics. In the 1919 influenza pandemic, masks were available and were dispensed to populations, but they had no impact on the epidemic curve. At the time, it was unknown that the influenza organism is nanoscopic and can theoretically penetrate the surgical mask barrier. As recently as 2010, the US National Academy of Sciences declared that, in the community setting, “face masks are not designed or certified to protect the wearer from exposure to respiratory hazards.” A number of studies have shown the inefficacy of the surgical mask in household settings to prevent transmission of the influenza virus…

273,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/09/us/coronavirus-us-news.html,2020-04-09,Jobless Claims Surpass 16 Million; Aid Package Stalls in Senate,"
This briefing has ended. Follow our live national updates and global coverage on the coronavirus epidemic.
As millions more Americans lose their jobs, more federal aid is uncertain. The harsh economic toll of the social distancing measures put in place to curb the spread of the pandemic was underscored on Thursday when the Labor Department reported that another 6.6 million people had filed for unemployment benefits last week.
That brought the number of Americans who had lost their jobs over the past three weeks to more than 16 million, which is more job losses than the most recent recession produced over two years. The dire figures suggested that Washington’s recent $2 trillion relief package was not working quickly enough to halt the economic devastation and the hemorrhaging of jobs in nearly every type of industry.
But efforts to bolster the relief package stalled in Washington. The Trump administration asked Congress to quickly approve $250 billion in spending to replenish a new loan program for distressed small businesses, but it hit a roadblock in the Senate on Thursday morning after Republicans and Democrats clashed over what to include.
Democrats want to double the size of the new emergency relief bill by adding $100 billion for hospitals and $150 billion for state and local governments, which are facing enormous shortfalls as the outbreak drives their expenses up and their tax collections down.
Republicans argued that the small business program had a more urgent need for funds, and that additional demands for aid could be addressed in future legislation.
With Congress in recess and lawmakers scattered around the country, Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, tried to push through the small business loan funding during a procedural session, a maneuver that would have required all senators to agree. But Democrats objected.
The House, which is scheduled to convene Friday in a procedural session, is not expected to try to pass either party’s proposal.
With help from Congress uncertain, the Federal Reserve on Thursday took action on its own round of emergency measures to help the economy. The central bank said it would use Treasury Department funds to buy municipal bonds and expand its purchases of corporate bonds. The efforts are aimed at shoring up companies as well as state and local governments, whose budgets are strained.
Positive coronavirus tests rise with age, White House data shows.
The White House coronavirus task force released a breakdown of testing data on Thursday, revealing that older Americans who are tested for the virus are more likely to test positive than other age groups.
Among people who were tested:11 percent of those under 25 were positive.17 percent of those between 25 and 45 were positive.21 percent of those between 45 and 65 were positive.22 percent of those between 65 and 85 were positive.24 percent of those over 85 were positive.Tests for the coronavirus are provided if people show symptoms such as a dry cough, fever or shortness of breath. Women are slightly more likely to get tested than men, although men seem to be more susceptible to the coronavirus, said Dr. Deborah Birx, the coronavirus response coordinator for the White House. Among women who were tested, 16 percent were positive; 23 percent of men who were tested had coronavirus infections.
The data, while disturbing, does not come entirely as a surprise. Similar trends have been observed in China and Italy, where men were both infected and succumbed to the coronavirus at higher rates than women.
“To all of our men out there, no matter what age group, if you have symptoms, you should be tested,” Dr. Birx said.
But one American man did not seem all that excited about wide-scale testing: President Trump.The president expressed reluctance to wait for comprehensive national testing before reopening the country for business and social life again. While he boasted that testing has increased drastically in recent days, he said it would be implausible to expect that the whole country could be screened for the virus as a condition of restoring normal life.
“Do you need it? No,” he said at his daily briefing. “Is it nice? Yes. We’re talking 325 million people. That’s not going to happen, as you can imagine.”
Even though more than 1,000 people are now dying every day in the United States, new infections have slowed in places where stringent measures have been in place for more than two weeks, offering some hope.
OPEC and Russia reach a deal to cut oil production amid lower demand.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and others including Russia on Thursday reached an agreement to temporarily cut large volumes of production, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.
OPEC and the other oil-producing countries agreed to cut about 10 million barrels a day, or about 10 percent from normal production levels, in May and June, said this person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the announcement had not been made official.
Possible further trims could come from a meeting of the Group of 20 nations on Friday.The Saudis have been engaged in a price war with Russia after Moscow refused to go along with a Saudi proposal in early March to trim output to deal with the effects of the pandemic. The spat threatened to swamp oil markets with vast oversupplies of crude.
Still, crude oil prices fell sharply on Thursday afternoon, in part because the production cuts were not expected to offset the fact that slowing economies and virus-related shutdowns have dampened demand for oil.
Stocks rose on Thursday after the Federal Reserve announced an expansion of its emergency lending powers in another bid to backstop the U.S. economy, but the gains faded in the afternoon after oil prices fell and shares of energy companies followed.
Still, the S&P 500 rose about 1.5 percent, bringing its gains this week to 12 percent. Markets in the U.S. are closed on Friday, ahead of Easter.
New York State and Pennsylvania set single-day records.
The number of patients hospitalized with the virus in New York State on Wednesday rose by only 200 from the previous day, the governor said Thursday, the smallest increase since before the statewide lockdown, even as he announced that 799 more people — another bleak record — had died.
The state’s fatality count increased to 7,067. For the second consecutive day, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo compared the toll of the virus to the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, calling the outbreak a “silent explosion that ripples through society with the same randomness, the same evil that we saw on 9/11.”
Although the governor said that some data, like the shrinking number of hospital admissions, suggested that New York was making headway, he warned against relaxing compliance with restrictions.
“The moment you stop following the policies, you will go right back and see that number shoot through the roof,” Mr. Cuomo.
At the same time, other New York officials have begun to cautiously envision an eventual return to some normalcy.
With transmission still widespread, Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York said Thursday that he thought the city could move as early as mid-May to the next stage: one with low-level spread of the virus, in which cases could be more easily traced.
“We can say that it’s time to start planning for the next phase very overtly,” Mr. de Blasio said at a news conference.
Gov. Phil Murphy of New Jersey on Thursday cited progress in the fight against the virus, even as he reported that another 198 people in the state had died.
In Pennsylvania, health officials on Thursday announced 1,989 new cases for a total of 18,228, the largest single-day jump so far. The number of cases in the state has doubled in a week, up from around 7,000 on April 2. The number of known deaths has also surged more than threefold in the same period, to 338 from 90.
At a White House briefing on Wednesday night, Vice President Mike Pence said Philadelphia had emerged as “an area of particular concern,” though local officials have pushed back against characterizing the city as a hot spot.
The outbreak spreads to the South, ‘a uniquely vulnerable population.’
With the virus spreading quickly across the South and expected to peak there in the next few weeks, public health experts said they were especially concerned about the toll it might take on an already vulnerable and at-risk population.
In the South, particularly in rural areas, dozens of hospitals have shuttered over the last decade. There are fewer insurance options for the poor, and the region has entrenched poverty and health issues, including high rates of diabetes and other ailments that worsen the effects of Covid-19.
Six of the nation’s poorest states are in the South, and the region is home to seven of the 10 unhealthiest states, according to the latest annual ranking by the United Health Foundation, which takes into account a mix of public health policy, environmental conditions and behaviors.
“I really don’t think we can say strongly enough that we are a uniquely vulnerable population here,” Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo, the director of the Division of Infectious Diseases at the University of Alabama in Birmingham, said in a recent briefing.
Critics said governors who delayed issuing orders to keep residents at home created a disadvantage in confronting the pandemic. All but one of the southern states has since announced shelter-in-place orders, with Arkansas the lone holdout.
California’s governor defends his decision to send ventilators to other states.
California’s decision to ship hundreds of ventilators to other states this week has been met with alarm by some local officials, who expressed concern about a shortage.
Earlier this week, workers packed the equipment for heavily hit states like New York and New Jersey and wrote messages of support on the boxes. “Prayers from the West Coast,” one read.
Gov. Gavin Newsom of California said a total of 500 ventilators would be split among Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, New York, Nevada, New Jersey and Washington, D.C. He described the shipments as a loan.
But in places like Riverside County, east of Los Angeles, officials expressed concern about a “fragile” supply chain. Hospitals there were anxiously preparing for a shortage in ventilators, they said.
Riverside County has been among the hardest hit in California, with more than 1,100 cases, at least 32 deaths and an outbreak at a nursing home that forced evacuations this week after a beleaguered and sickened staff failed to show up two days in a row.
County officials said this week that the state had denied its request for ventilators, and that a second one was pending.
At his daily news briefing on Thursday, Mr. Newsom sought to allay those concerns and pushed back against the idea that the state was neglecting its own needs, although he did not name Riverside or Santa Clara Counties.
“It was the right thing to do, and it was the responsible thing to do as Americans,” he said. “We can’t just sit on assets when we could save lives in other states.”
Mr. Newsom also said he was encouraged by — but not drawing too many conclusions from — the state’s first drop in the number of coronavirus patients who were being treated in intensive care units.
He said there were 1,132 people receiving intensive care as of Thursday, a 1.9 percent decrease from the day before.
“One data point is not a trend,” he warned. “One data point is not a headline, so I caution anybody to read too much into that one point of data, but nonetheless it is encouraging and it just again reinforces the incredible work that all of you are doing.”
The modeling curve of coronavirus cases, he said, had been “bent” by the efforts of Californians who have been following suggested practices like staying indoors, avoiding other people and washing their hands.
A Louisiana lawmaker becomes the latest state legislator to die from the virus.A Louisiana state representative died this week from the coronavirus, according to his son, the latest sign that the pandemic is making incursions into the nation’s state legislatures.
The representative, Reggie Paul Bagala, was elected last year to represent Jefferson and Lafourche Parishes.
Mr. Bagala, a conservative businessman who also worked in local government, had been on a ventilator at Ochsner St. Anne Hospital in Raceland, La., according to his son, Tristan Paul Bagala, who had chronicled his father’s battle with the virus on Facebook. He was 54, according to Nola.com.
Mr. Bagala was at least the second state lawmaker nationwide to die of the virus. On April 3, Bob Glanzer, a Republican state representative from South Dakota, died at Avera McKennan Hospital & University Health Center in Sioux Falls. He was 74 and had served in the South Dakota House of Representatives since 2017, according to Gov. Kristi Noem.
Late last month, Isaac Robinson, a first-term Democratic state representative from Michigan, died at 44. A lawyer who had worked in the labor movement, he represented Hamtramck and parts of Detroit.
Mr. Robinson’s mother, Rose Mary C. Robinson, who was herself a former state representative, told The Associated Press that although no cause was given for her son’s death, she suspected he died of Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus. She said he had not been tested for the virus, but had been taken to the hospital for breathing problems.
Cruise ship passengers outside Miami face a 14-day quarantine at sea.
Thirteen cruise ship passengers who have been on board the Coral Princess for more than a month will have to spend two weeks in quarantine at sea with the crew, because travel restrictions in their countries of origin prevent them from going home, the cruise line said Thursday.
The authorities in Miami, where the ship has been docked since Saturday, have not allowed the passengers to stay in local hotels, the company said.
The Coral Princess, a ship owned by the Carnival Corporation, arrived in Florida last week with more than 1,000 passengers on board — two of them dead and at least a dozen with positive tests for the coronavirus. A third passenger waited hours on the dock for an ambulance and later died in a Miami hospital.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention required the cruise company to arrange charter flights to get passengers home. But four countries that have closed their borders to stop the spread of the coronavirus — Colombia, Ecuador, Russia and Serbia — would not accept the passengers, even though they are their own citizens.
After everyone else evacuated the ship over the past four days, the remaining guests were to join the crew and depart Thursday night for a 14-day quarantine at sea.
On Thursday night, the C.D.C. modified and extended its so-called No Sail Order for cruise ships in ways that appeared to bring the industry to a halt in United States ports.
The order, the C.D.C. said, “ceases operations of cruise ships in waters in which the United States may exert jurisdiction” and requires them to develop a detailed, government-approved plan to monitor and address the pandemic’s effect on their operations. Operators are not allowed to disembark passengers or crew members at American ports, or return crew members to ships, without government approval “until further notice.”
European officials agree to spend more than a half-trillion euros on economic relief.
European Union finance ministers on Thursday agreed to the outlines of a loan package worth more than half a trillion euros to help the bloc’s nations relieve the severe economic blow from the pandemic.
The measures, which must be approved by the bloc’s leaders, could total up to €540 billion, or $590 billion, a show of solidarity as the economic and health crisis brought on by the virus strains bonds among the member countries.
The agreement includes €100 billion to fund unemployment benefits, €200 billion for loans to smaller businesses, and up to €240 billion lent by the Eurozone’s bailout fund to member states, to cover potentially crippling health care-related costs.
Some details, most notably on the terms and conditions of loans to countries from the bailout fund, were still unclear and could prove contentious. Countries like Italy that are likely to tap those loans want to ensure they don’t come with austerity conditions attached.
The ministers did not agree to issue bonds backed by the entire bloc, which had come to be known as “coronabonds,” in a defeat for Italy and Spain, the two worst-hit countries. Germany, the Netherlands and other richer northern European countries had staunchly opposed joint debt issuance.
In the race for virus drugs, a scientist on the front lines is urging caution.
Insistent calls and emails pile up each day for Dr. Andre Kalil at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. Patients and their doctors are clamoring for untested virus treatments, encouraged by President Trump, who said that ill patients should have ready access to experimental medicines, like the anti-malarial drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine.
Dr. Kalil, 54, is a principal investigator in the federal government’s clinical trial of drugs that may treat the virus. It is starting with remdesivir, an antiviral drug. The first results will be ready within weeks.
Dr. Kalil has decades of experience grappling with questions about the use — and misuse — of experimental drugs, and he has rarely been more frustrated. He has seen what happens when desperation drives treatment decisions. “Many drugs we believed were fantastic ended up killing people,” he said in an interview. “It is so hard to keep explaining that.”
Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, Dr. Kalil said, have never been found to work against any viral disease, including Ebola. (Malaria is caused by a parasite, not a virus.) And the drugs have side effects, some of which could be fatal.
The virus is sickening and killing low-wage workers in meat plants.
The virus has reached the processing plants where thousands of workers typically stand elbow-to-elbow to do the low-wage work of cutting, deboning and packing the chicken and beef that Americans savor.
Some plants have offered financial incentives to keep workers on the job, but the virus’s swift spread is causing illness and forcing plants to close.
Smithfield Foods’ pork plant in Sioux Falls, S.D., announced on Thursday that it would close temporarily, after more than 80 workers tested positive. Workers have come down with the disease in several poultry plants in the South, including in Alabama, Georgia and Tennessee.
JBS, the world’s largest meat processor, confirmed the death of one worker at a Colorado facility and shuttered a Pennsylvania plant for two weeks. Cargill this week closed a Pennsylvania facility that produces steaks, ground beef and ground pork. Tyson Foods halted operations at an Iowa pork plant after more than two dozen workers tested positive.
“How many more have to fight for their life, how many more families got to suffer before they realize we are more important than their production,” asked Tanisha Isom, 36, a deboner at a Tyson poultry plant in Camilla, Ga., where three workers have died in recent days. She recently learned she had bronchitis and missed two weeks of work.
At some plants, workers have staged walkouts over concerns that they are not being properly protected. Industry analysts said the plant closures were unlikely to result in serious disruptions to the food supply.
The White House gave virus tests to reporters.The White House for the first time conducted rapid coronavirus tests Thursday on all journalists attending the daily briefing led by President Trump after a reporter who was in the building earlier this week fell ill.
Journalists were tested one by one in a vacant office, with results delivered before the briefing. Last week White House doctors began administering rapid tests to others who came into “close proximity” to Mr. Trump or Vice President Mike Pence, but this was the first time that journalists have been tested.
An unidentified news organization employee who was at the White House as recently as Tuesday has reported experiencing symptoms consistent with the coronavirus and is expected to have test results back later on Thursday.
Also on Thursday, Melania Trump, the first lady, posted a video on Twitter advising Americans to wear face coverings in public, echoing public health recommendations that Mr. Trump has personally eschewed.
Nurses and doctors who speak out about the risks they face also risk their jobs.
Workers as varied as grocery store cashiers, customer service representatives and flight attendants have clashed with their employers, whom they accuse of failing to protect and properly value them. Amazon drew widespread attention when it fired a worker who had led a protest over health concerns at a Staten Island warehouse.
But perhaps the most curious and persistent management-labor tension has arisen among health care providers like doctors and nurses, who are at the forefront of the virus battle, and their administrators.
In New York City, the center of the crisis in the United States, every major private hospital system and some public hospitals in recent weeks sent memos ordering workers not to speak to the news media.
One system, NYU Langone Medical Center, sent an email on March 27 warning that staff members who spoke to the news media without permission would be “subject to disciplinary action, including termination.” The email was reported earlier by Bloomberg.
Similar lines are being drawn nationwide. A doctor in Washington State was removed from his hospital position after speaking publicly about a shortage of protective equipment and testing; the staffing firm that employed him said he was being reassigned. Nurses in Detroit recently walked off the job to protest critically low staffing after a colleague who had spoken up on the issue was fired.
The first crew member from the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt is hospitalized because of virus.
A sailor stricken with the virus and assigned to the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt has been admitted to an intensive care unit at a Navy hospital in Guam, a Defense Department official said, marking the first hospitalization of a crew member since an outbreak began aboard the ship last month.
At least 286 members of the crew have tested positive for the virus.“The sailor tested positive for Covid-19 on March 30 and at the time of hospitalization was in a 14-day isolation period on Naval Base Guam,” Cmdr. Clayton Doss, a Navy spokesman, said in an email.
The outbreak aboard the Roosevelt has been, in many ways, a microcosm of the Defense Department’s handling of the virus within its ranks as military officials have weighed military preparedness with the health of its personnel.
The ship’s commanding officer, Capt. Brett E. Crozier, was relieved after he wrote a strongly worded letter to Navy officials pleading for more help aboard the carrier. The fallout from the episode led to the resignation of Thomas B. Modly, the acting Navy secretary, this week.
Inmates test positive, setting off a protest in a Washington State prison.
Police officers fired pepper spray and “sting balls” filled with rubber pellets to quell a protest of more than 100 inmates at a state prison in Monroe, Wash., on Wednesday evening after six prisoners tested positive for the coronavirus.
Prisoners in the minimum-security unit, where the men had tested positive, set off fire extinguishers to create the appearance of smoke and then refused to leave the recreation yard, according to a statement from the state’s Corrections Department. The protest ended without injuries, but prisoner movement at the facility, which holds about 450 inmates, was restricted.
The chaos came as the nation’s jails and prisons, where prisoners often live just feet apart, faced urgent reckonings over the virus and whether they could adequately protect inmates. Some prisoners have staged hunger strikes, and the courts have been considering lawsuits seeking the release of vulnerable inmates across the country.
As of Wednesday, The New York Times had identified at least 1,324 confirmed coronavirus cases tied to U.S. prisons and jails, including at least 32 deaths. Those numbers are most likely a vast undercount, because some state and local agencies have not released information, and others, including the federal Bureau of Prisons, are not testing everyone who falls ill.
According to Times data, the Cook County Jail in Chicago is the largest-known source of infection in the United States. As of Thursday morning, at least 401 inmates and employees had tested positive for the virus.
Texas man is accused of falsely claiming to have paid someone to spread the virus.
A San Antonio man who became upset that so many people were crowding into grocery stores took his frustration to a criminal extreme and made an untrue claim on Facebook that he had paid someone to spread the illness, the authorities have said.
The man, Christopher Charles Perez, 39, made the false claim in the hope that it would deter shoppers from visiting the stores, and in that way keep them from spreading the contagion, according to a federal complaint.
San Antonio has been contending with a surge of infections and deaths.An outbreak at the Southeast Nursing and Rehabilitation Center has claimed at least 10 lives. Four San Antonio police officers have tested positive. And as hotel-occupancy tax revenues decline, officials said on Wednesday that about 270 city employees would be furloughed on April 23.
An anonymous tipster sent a screenshot of Mr. Perez’s Facebook post on Sunday to law enforcement, officials said in a statement on Wednesday. In the post, Mr. Perez warned a grocery store chain that his “homeboys cousin has Covid-19 and has licked every thing for past 2 days cause we paid him too,” according to court documents. Mr. Perez was arrested on Tuesday.
“To be clear, the alleged threat was false,” the office of John F. Bash, the United States Attorney for the Western District of Texas, said. “No one spread coronavirus at grocery stores, according to investigators.”

1727,https://truepundit.com/doctors-raise-alarm-about-health-effects-of-continued-coronavirus-shutdown-mass-casualty-incident/,2020-05-22,Doctors raise alarm about health effects of continued coronavirus shutdown: 'Mass casualty incident' – True Pundit,"More than 600 doctors signed onto a letter sent to President Trump Tuesday pushing him to end the “national shutdown” aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus, calling the widespread state orders keeping businesses closed and kids home from school a “mass casualty incident” with “exponentially growing health consequences.”

The letter outlines a variety of consequences that the doctors have observed resulting from the coronavirus shutdowns, including patients missing routine checkups that could detect things like heart problems or cancer, increases in substance and alcohol abuse, and increases in financial instability that could lead to “overty and financial uncertainty,” which “is closely linked to poor health.”

“We are alarmed at what appears to be the lack of consideration for the future health of our patients,” the doctors say in their letter. “The downstream health effects … are being massively under-estimated and under-reported. This is an order of magnitude error.”

The letter continues: “The millions of casualties of a continued shutdown will be hiding in plain sight, but they will be called alcoholism, homelessness, suicide, heart attack, stroke, or kidney failure. In youths it will be called financial instability, unemployment, despair, drug addiction, unplanned pregnancies, poverty, and abuse.

“Because the harm is diffuse, there are those who hold that it does not exist. We, the undersigned, know otherwise.”

The letter comes as the battle over when and how to lift coronavirus restrictions continues to rage on cable television, in the courts, in protests and among government officials. Those for lifting the restrictions have warned about the economic consequences of keeping the shutdowns in effect. Those advocating a more cautious approach say that having more people out and about will necessarily end with more people becoming infected, causing what National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci warned in a Senate hearing last week would be preventable “suffering and death.” – READ MORE

99,https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html,2020-03-18,Your Money: A Hub for Help During the Coronavirus Crisis,"
If your income has fallen or been cut off completely, we’re here to help. This guide will connect you to the basic information you’ll need to get through this, including on government benefits, free services and financial strategies. This guide has been updated with the details of the $2 trillion relief plan that has been enacted by Washington.
If you have a question that we have not answered about various forms of relief — or something you can offer that large numbers of people can access — please write to hubforhelp@nytimes.com. Ron and Tara will read every message.
Stimulus ChecksThe giant economic stimulus package will enable the federal government to begin making the payments, though the amount you receive will depend on your income.
Single adults who have an adjusted gross income of $75,000 or less will get the full $1,200, while married couples with no children and earning $150,000 or less will receive a total of $2,400. For every qualifying child age 16 or under, you get another $500.
People who earn more will see their payments decrease until they phase out completely. That happens for single people earning $99,000 or married people who have no children and earn $198,000. There are other situations that make certain people ineligible — college-age children who were claimed as dependents on their parents’ returns won’t receive a check, for example. And you generally need a valid Social Security number to collect as well.
Many people don’t have to do anything to receive the payment. If the Internal Revenue Service already has your bank account information from your 2018 or 2019 tax returns, it will transfer the money to you via direct deposit based on the recent income-tax figures it already has.
Payments started landing in mid-April, but it could take a few months more for some people to get them, despite the government’s removal of some hurdles. You can find out more about checking on the whereabouts of your payment here.
Unemployment InsuranceThe new relief package made significant, albeit temporary, changes to the way the unemployment insurance system works and increases benefit amounts until July 31.
Under the plan, these state programs now cover far more people than are usually eligible, including self-employed people and part-time workers.
The plan also makes exceptions for people who cannot work for a variety of coronavirus-related reasons — and you don’t necessarily need to lose your job to qualify. If you’re quarantined or have been furloughed — if you’re not being paid but expect to return to your job eventually — you may be able to get unemployment insurance.
States set many of their own rules, including for benefit amounts, which are generally calculated as a percentage of your income over the past year, up to a certain maximum. Some states are more generous than others, but unemployment typically replaces roughly 45 percent of your lost income.
Most states pay benefits for 26 weeks, though some states have trimmed that back. (This primer provides more information about how the program usually works when the country isn’t struggling to contain a pandemic; eligibility rules have changed since this was last posted.)
The new law temporarily increases the amount of benefits by $600 weekly. It also extends by up to 13 weeks the time period for which state-level benefits are available for many workers. Here’s a helpful illustration that breaks down how the program works in New York state.
Paid Sick Leave and Family LeaveThe coronavirus emergency relief package gives many American workers paid leave if they need to take time off because of the outbreak, but there are lots of exceptions.
Most workers at small and midsize companies, as well as government employees, can get two weeks of paid sick leave if they are ill or seeking care, as long as they’ve been employed at least 30 days. They can receive their full pay, up to $511 a day.
Some workers can also get 12 weeks of paid leave to care for children whose schools are closed, or whose child care provider is unavailable because of the outbreak, but fewer workers qualify for this type of leave. They can receive two-thirds of their usual pay, up to $200 a day.
Part-time workers will be paid the amount they typically earn in a two-week period, up to the daily limits. People who are self-employed — including gig workers like Uber drivers and Instacart shoppers — can also receive paid leave, but they must calculate their average daily income and claim it as a tax credit.
There are gaps, though. Employers with fewer than 50 workers can deny workers the child-care leave (but not the sick leave) if it would be hard on their businesses, and companies with more than 500 employees are excluded from the rules entirely. Many workers at big businesses already have paid sick leave, but their low-wage workers are the least likely to be covered. The New America Foundation has published a detailed list of large employers (mostly consumer-facing companies like retailers, restaurant chains and hotels) and their policies.
And these changes aren’t permanent — the leave law expires Dec. 31.You can find out more from the Department of Labor, which has posted a fact sheet for workers and a Q&A.
Federal Student LoansIf you have a federal student loan, you should automatically receive some relief without lifting a finger: Borrowers will be placed in so-called administrative forbearance, which allows you to temporarily stop making payments from March 13 until Sept. 30.
No interest will accrue during the administrative forbearance period. (Usually interest continues to pile up when borrowers pause their payments because of a hardship.) Interest you accrued before the period began will also not be rolled into your loan principal,  according to a Department of Education spokeswoman.
Borrowers who want to continue making loan payments can do so — and you may end up paying the balance down faster if the full amount of your payment can be applied to your loan’s principal.
The Education Department says loan payments that are skipped under the administrative forbearance will still count toward loan forgiveness for borrowers in income-driven repayment and public service loan forgiveness programs, as long as the other usual requirements are fulfilled. Your loan servicer will have more details.
But keep in mind that for now, this relief applies only to federal student loans owned by the Education Department, such as direct loans (including those in default). Loans issued through state agencies and others, including big private lenders like Sallie Mae, are not covered. Other loans not covered include the majority of Federal Family Education Loans, which are mostly held by commercial lenders, and school-held Perkins loans.
Some private lenders are offering relief programs. Sallie Mae said it was offering suspension of payment for up to three months, with no damage to a borrower’s credit. Another, Navient, made an identical offer for “qualified” borrowers; a spokesman said you just need to contact the company and explain how your financial situation had changed. A third big private lender, Wells Fargo, says it will offer help, but a spokesman said the bank would not commit to a set number of months or any other specifics.
If you have more questions, check out the Education Department’s Q&A here. It addresses what to do if you have auto-debit payments (they’re suspended during this period), are trying to rehabilitate a defaulted loan, and more.
To see if your loans are eligible for this temporary pause, try contacting your loan servicer — the company where you send monthly payments — online or by phone. If you do not know who your servicer is or how to contact it, go to StudentAid.gov/login or call 1-800-4-FED-AID (1-800-433-3243; T.T.Y. for the deaf or hearing-impaired 1-800-730-8913) for more help.
Mortgages and RentMillions of homeowners have already pressed the pause button on their mortgage payments, now that their financial lives have been upended by the pandemic.
Under the CARES Act, homeowners with mortgages backed by the federal government are permitted to temporarily suspend their payments, a move called a forbearance, for up to a year. This covers about 70 percent of mortgage holders and includes loans backed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration (known as F.H.A. loans), and those guaranteed by the Department of Veterans and the Department of Agriculture.
After the forbearance period is over, however, the skipped payments must be paid back. And how that is done will vary depending on your personal circumstances — and who owns your loan. About 30 percent of mortgage holders have loans owned by banks or private borrowers, and their options aren’t always clear.
If you have a federally backed loan, you should be presented with several different ways to become current on your mortgage — and none of them require you to immediately pay the money back in a lump sum (but you can if you want to). If you can afford to resume your regular payments, you might pay the money back over several months, for example, or settle up when the home is sold, refinanced or when the mortgage term is up.
People who cannot afford to make their mortgage payments after the forbearance period expires will probably have to modify their loan (to lower the monthly amount), a more formal process that will require an application.
To find out which entity may control your mortgage, you can search your address on various government websites. And if you don’t feel like you are being treated fairly — or are simply overwhelmed by the process — it might help to find a housing counselor. For more information, check out our short resource guide here.
Federal housing officials have also announced a nationwide eviction and foreclosure moratorium for borrowers with loans backed by Fannie, Freddie and the F.H.A. This includes foreclosures that are already in progress.
A coalition of mortgage industry groups representing banks, finance companies and others has said it will also grant payment suspensions of at least three months — and up to 12 months — to homeowners whose loans are not owned by Fannie or Freddie, but they have said their effort requires a federal backstop.
If you rent, the best national resource we’ve found so far is the search-by-state function on Justshelter.org. This offers information on local organizations that can provide advice to renters in distress. Just Shelter’s founders are Matthew Desmond, the author of the book “Evicted,” and Tessa Lowinske Desmond. Mr. Desmond is also the founder of Eviction Lab; it is publishing a list of local and regional actions to pause evictions of renters.
The emergency stimulus bill put a temporary, nationwide eviction moratorium in place for any renters whose landlords have mortgages backed or owned by Fannie, Freddie or the F.H.A. This will last through the end of July, and landlords can’t charge any fees or penalties for nonpayment of rent either. The moratorium applies only to eviction for nonpayment; tenants can still be evicted for other reasons.
Regulators have also told landlords whose own mortgages are owned by Fannie or Freddie that they too can use forbearance, just as long as they do not evict tenants after they pause their mortgage payments. The challenge for renters is figuring out whether their landlord has such a mortgage. This information sometimes appears if you look up the address in the National Housing Preservation Database.
If the landlord’s mortgage is not in forbearance, renters who skip payments could be risking eviction if there has not been a local prohibition. (New York, for example, has suspended eviction actions until further notice.)
Utility BillsSome utility providers are offering to stop cutting people off for nonpayment.A number of large internet companies have agreed not to terminate residential or small business customers who can’t pay their bills: AT&T, Comcast, Cox, RCN, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon. A full list of companies is available on the Federal Communications Commission site.
It is not yet clear whether companies want customers to call to invoke this relief and provide proof or whether they will offer it automatically to everyone. People who need help should call and ask.
A number of water service providers have either suspended shut-offs for nonpayment or don’t shut service off for late payments generally, according to a ProPublica roundup. They include Atlanta; Birmingham, Ala.; Long Beach, Calif.; Los Angeles; Newark; New York City and St. Louis.
In Washington state, the main Seattle area utilities are suspending cutoffs as well. In addition, the provider of electric and water service in Seattle is allowing people to self-certify their recent income reductions in order to qualify for at least half off their bills.
In California, Pacific Gas and Electric has, until further notice, stopped shutting off its services to consumers and businesses who have not paid.
In New York, Con Edison also has temporarily suspended any electric and gas service shut-offs.If utilities in other areas follow suit, they are likely to publish alerts somewhere on the top of their websites or in the news release section of their pages.
More Helpful AdviceYou have three extra months to file your federal income taxes. The federal government has moved the tax filing deadline to July 15. You don’t have to file your return or make payments until then. If you are owed a refund, you’ll still receive it as normal when you file your tax return, no matter when you submit it. Don’t forget about your state income taxes: The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants is tracking state changes on its website.

Special to USA TODAY

Johnny C. Taylor Jr., a human resources expert, tackles your questions as part of a series for USA TODAY. Taylor is president and CEO of the Society for Human Resource Management, the world's largest HR professional society.

The questions are submitted by readers, and Taylor's answers have been edited for length and clarity.

Have a question? Do you have an HR or work-related question you’d like me to answer? Submit it here.

Question: I have been working from home for about a month now due to the coronavirus. It was fine at first, but I’m beginning to feel disconnected from my work and my team. How can I ensure my colleagues and I remain on the same page? Unfortunately, things are not business as usual around here. – Anonymous

Answer: I’m sorry to hear you feel disconnected. Telework is certainly not ideal for everyone – especially when it’s effectively mandated, rather than freely chosen.

If it’s any consolation, you’re not alone in your remote work difficulties. Forty-one percent of U.S. employees feel burnt out from work during this pandemic as many find themselves working longer hours and struggling to stay connected with colleagues.

In fact, it’s likely your boss is struggling with the same problem – albeit from a different perspective: 65% of employers say maintaining employee morale has been a challenge.

Here’s my advice for you: Communicate, communicate, communicate.

If you think your team is desynchronized, be sure to let your boss know. Tackling this could mean scheduling weekly meetings to discuss projects, housekeeping items or even simple check-ins. Or there may be a better way to share information by centralizing and organizing the tasks and projects you’re collaborating on.

Missing workplace banter and face-to-face interaction? Set up a video call with a co-worker and ask how he or she manages remote work. Odds are, that person may feel disconnected, too, and will be happy to hear from you – and might be able to share some remote work tips. You could even start a group instant message about recommended TV shows, books and movies to enjoy during downtime under lockdown.

Believe me, I understand the difficulties. But as a radical optimist, I can’t help but see the silver lining.

Though we may be more isolated, we’re not alone – the struggle is shared by us all. The teams that see that and come together to create connection won’t merely survive this crisis. They’ll come out the other side better because of it.

Stay strong!

Saying no: How to respond when the boss has a get-rich-quick scheme. Ask HR

At risk for COVID-19:What if you are an at-risk worker and your company won't let you work from home? Ask HR

Q: Can you be fired for not getting the flu shot or other vaccinations? – Anonymous

A: I get this question a lot lately because the whole world is searching for a COVID-19 vaccine and employers want to know whether they can mandate their employers take it once it's available. The answer is complicated, so bear with me.

Generally speaking, the answer is yes. Your employer can require or mandate a vaccine as a term and condition of employment.

For decades, health care and education employers have required employees to take the flu shot and show proof of other major vaccinations – such as those for tetanus, polio or measles – since they are in close contact with vulnerable populations such as children, the elderly and immunocompromised people.

I predict, because of the damage COVID-19 has done to lives and livelihoods, we will see many more employers in other sectors make this a requirement.

There are exemptions under federal and certain state laws protecting the rights of people who wish not to be vaccinated. These exceptions require more than an employee stating a generalized belief that vaccines may be harmful. Some exemptions pertain to religious or philosophical views, though there are also medical reasons – such as an underlying condition – that could put certain vaccines out of the question.

You didn’t mention whether you are personally concerned about required vaccines. If you are, and your job requires vaccination, you will need to have a conversation with your employer about your refusal, your reasoning and whether an accommodation can be made.",real

Other states have joined them in relaxing stay-at-home orders, including Colorado, Oklahoma, Montana, Mississippi, Indiana, and Alaska.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is also allowing certain regions of the state to begin reopening on May 16.

The US is seeing sustained plateaus of coronavirus cases, but more Americans are still dying from COVID-19 per week than from any other common cause of death.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Around 95% of Americans were under lockdown in April to help curb the spread of the coronavirus. And it was working, as the US began seeing sustained declining plateaus of new cases.

But as federal social distancing guidelines expired at the end of April, more than half of US states began reopening.

Now, there are already talks of relieving the economic pain brought on by the lockdown — but reopening the economy might look different for every state and is likely to be done in phases.

That's because reopening plans are dependent on various factors, like controlling the rate of infections and hospitalizations, making testing and contact tracing more widespread, making sure healthcare facilities are properly equipped to handle another resurgence, and employing social distancing practices in the workplace.

Several reopening plans, such as those laid out by the Trump administration and by researchers with the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said that a state should see a declining number of new cases for at least two weeks before reopening. It's a threshold that most states haven't hit yet, The New York Times reported the first week of May.

Some states are already making moves to begin reopening parts of their economies, even as more Americans die from COVID-19 per week than from any other common cause of death, according to data analysis by Business Insider. Some, including Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina, were among the last to issue stay-at-home orders, doing so in April after many other states already had in March.

In fact, in several of the states that have begun to reopen, the number of new cases of COVID-19 seem to still be steadily rising. Where most cases early in the outbreak were reported primarily in urban areas like New York and Seattle, recent analysis from the Kaiser Family Foundation indicates that from April 13 to April 27, rural counties saw an average 125% increase in new coronavirus infections, leaping from 51 to 115 new cases per 100,000 people.

After initially reopening his state, Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves slowed his 'back to normal' plans on May 1 when the state reported 397 new cases and 20 new deaths that day, its highest daily numbers to date.

On May 7, the Associated Press reported that the Trump administration had halted the publication of new CDC research and safety guidelines for states attempting to reopen their economies, regarding how local schools, places of worship, restaurants, and health facilities should handle social distancing. The document was pulled because of the Trump administration's ongoing preference that states assume the responsibility to determine their own reopening requirements, and that the federal government should be the ""last resort"" for states that need coronavirus testing support, per the AP.

President Donald Trump, who publicly identified the affected Pence aide, said he was “not worried” about the virus spreading in the White House. Nonetheless, officials said they were stepping up safety protocols for the complex.

Pence spokeswoman Katie Miller, who tested positive Friday, had been in recent contact with Pence but not with the president. She is married to Stephen Miller, a top Trump adviser. The White House had no immediate comment on whether Stephen Miller had been tested or if he was still working out of the White House.

Katie Miller had tested negative Thursday, a day before her positive result.

“This is why the whole concept of tests aren’t necessarily great,” Trump said. “The tests are perfect but something can happen between a test where it’s good and then something happens.”

The positive test for the senior Pence aide came one day after White House officials confirmed that a member of the military serving as one of Trump’s valets had tested positive for COVID-19.

Six people who had been in contact with Miller were scheduled to fly with Pence on Friday to Des Moines, Iowa, on Air Force Two. They were removed from the flight just before it took off, according to a senior administration official.

None of those people were exhibiting symptoms, but were asked to deplane so they could be tested “out of an abundance of caution,” a senior administration official told reporters traveling with Pence. All six later tested negative, the White House said.

The official said staff in the West Wing are tested regularly but much of Pence’s staff — which works next door in the Executive Office Building — are tested less frequently. Katie Miller was not on the plane and had not been scheduled to be on the trip.

Pence, who is tested on a regular basis, was tested Friday.

White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said the administration was stepping up mitigation efforts already recommended by public health experts and taking other unspecified precautions to ensure the safety of the president.

Meadows said the White House was “probably the safest place that you can come,” but he was reviewing further steps to keep Trump and Pence safe.

The White House requires daily temperature checks of anyone who enters the White House complex and has encouraged social distancing among those working in the building. The administration has also directed regular deep cleaning of all work spaces. Anyone who comes in close proximity to the president and vice president is tested daily for COVID-19.

“We’ve already put in a few protocols that we’re looking at, obviously, to make sure that the president and his immediate staff stay safe. But it’s not just the president, it’s all the workers that are here ... on a daily basis,” Meadows said.

Trump’s valet’s case marked the first known instance where a person who has come in close proximity to the president has tested positive since several people present at his private Florida club were diagnosed with COVID-19 in early March. The valet tested positive Wednesday.

The White House was moving to shore up its protection protocols to protect the nation’s political leaders. Trump said some staffers who interact with him closely would now be tested daily. Pence told reporters Thursday that both he and Trump would now be tested daily as well.",real

Loeffler gives documents to Justice Department,"Sen. Kelly Loeffler, R-Ga., her husband Jeffrey Sprecher participate in Loefflers swear-in reenactment for the cameras in the Capitol on Monday, Jan. 6, 2020.

Intercontinental Exchange, which owns the New York Stock Exchange, refused to say Friday whether it has given federal law enforcement agencies information related to stock sales by CEO and Chairman Jeff Sprecher and his wife, Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler.

Intercontinental Exchange formally declined to comment after a flurry of news about a probe into stock sales in trading accounts related to four senators.

That news included Loeffler revealing that she has given documents and information to the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Senate Ethics Committee about the sales from accounts she had with Sprecher.

Those sales came in the weeks before financial markets plunged as the Covid-19 pandemic spread in the United States.

Intercontinental Exchange has not said in regulatory filings that either the company or Sprecher are the subject of criminal or civil probes or have turned over information to investigators about the CEO's trades.

The FBI and Department of Justice appears to be eyeing trades by Loeffler and Sprecher, as well as by Sens. Richard Burr, R-N.C., and Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., and by the husband of Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.

Accounts connected to those senators cumulatively sold millions of dollars worth of stock in the weeks before financial markets crashed in late February as Covid-19 cases in the United States began spiking.

Starting on Jan. 24, Loeffler and Sprecher sold stocks over the next three weeks that were valued at between $1.3 million and $3.1 million, according to disclosure reports filed by the senator.

All four senators say they did nothing wrong, and that the trades were not connected to non-public information they received.

That includes private briefings for lawmakers in January and early February by top federal health officials who warned senators about the potential impact of the coronavirus outbreak before the United States began seeing large numbers of officially reported cases.

Sprecher and Loeffler's sales began on the same day that Loeffler attended a senators-only briefing on the coronavirus.",real

It's the creative concept that an Ocean City, Maryland, restaurant unveiled over the weekend to keep patrons at least 6 feet apart once the governor gave the OK for restaurants and bars to reopen.

Shaped like oversized inner tubes, the tables were custom made for Fish Tales, where employees rolled them out of a large box truck for their Facebook live debut over the weekend, reports the Salisbury Daily Times, which is a part of the USA TODAY Network.

""It's like a bumper boat, but it's actually a table,"" owner Shawn Harmon said of the design, which was developed by Revolution Event Design and Production in Baltimore.

A customer will stand in the center of the circular table surrounded by a rubber barrier that keeps them safely separated from other patrons in accordance with social distancing guidelines. The tables sit on wheels that allow them to stay mobile.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had restaurants and bars across Maryland shuttered – with the exception of carryout and delivery service – since mid-March in an effort to curb the virus's spread.

Now that the state has eased into stage one of its gradual Roadmap to Recovery, eateries are itching to one day soon hopefully resume dine-in service.

Fish Tales is providing curbside and carryout service seven days a week and has also put significant distance between its outdoor tables in anticipation of being able to wait on patrons again.

""We've taken this very seriously from the beginning, and we just want to let everyone know what we've done in the interim to make sure that everybody stays safe and Ocean City can stay open,"" Harmon said in a social media video about the measures the establishment has taken.

Britain, the world’s largest offshore wind market accounting for around 40% of global capacity, plans to generate more than a third of its electricity from the technology by 2030 in a bid to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050.

Iberdrola’s East Anglia (EA) hub project comprises three projects off the east coast of England, capable of generating a total of 3.1 gigawatts of electricity, which would make it one of the largest offshore wind projects in the world.

Under Britain’s contract for difference (CfD) scheme, qualifying projects are guaranteed a minimum price at which they can sell electricity. Renewable power generators bid for CfD contracts at auction.

“The plan is to have all of the projects fully consented in Q1 (2021)… ready to bid into the auction later in the year as the combined hub,” Jonathan Cole, Managing Director, Iberdrola Renewables Offshore Wind said in an interview.

Cole added that the project could still go ahead, even if it is unsuccessful in the auction.

“We believe super-scale developments like EA Hub will be key to Europe’s decarbonisation plans, whether it sells power via government-backed contracts or private power sales arrangements. We are looking at all options.” he said.

Construction on the project could start in 2022 and will take around four years to complete.

Iberdrola is already developing the East Anglia One project in the same region and Cole said the last of the 102 turbines was installed last month.

The 714 megawatt project will be fully operational in the next few months, he said.

1446,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/05/19/white-house-coronavirus-economic-recovery/,2020-05-19,"President Trump’s senior advisers now predict swift economic recovery, despite warnings that major problems could persist","“It almost feels like today is the first day,” Trump said during a White House meeting on Monday. “People are starting to go out. They’re opening. They get it.”



The White House’s rosy view of the U.S. economy’s trajectory clashes with the dire predictions of many mainstream economists, as well as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell, who is set to testify before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday alongside Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.



Powell said last week that lawmakers should strongly consider passing additional stimulus measures to avoid a severe and prolonged economic downturn. The unemployment rate rocketed from 3.5 percent in February to 14.7 percent in April, and it is projected to continue climbing.

Many economists and Wall Street analysts say the unemployment rate could remain above 10 percent into 2021 — a level unseen since the Great Depression — even if lawmakers approve more emergency aid. Powell said in a “60 Minutes” interview that it could eclipse 25 percent later this year.



White House economic officials believe some of these trends can be quickly reversed. They are monitoring the reopening of states such as Georgia and Texas with cautious optimism that they could presage a broader recovery, according to two people in communication with them who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private talks.



On Monday, White House economist Kevin Hassett cited what he called positive economic trends in retail, business reopenings, and credit card transaction data over the past two weeks. He said the administration has “a little bit of a luxury to watch and see” before having to approve additional aid.

“I’ve been really positively impressed by how quickly things are turning around,” Hassett told reporters on Monday. He added at a separate White House event: “I was pretty depressed about how bad it looked a few weeks ago, but you can really see it turning on faster than I thought.""



Numerous economists and the leader of the nation’s central bank are strongly warning against too sunny a view of the economic recovery. Critics say Trump and his aides have for months overstated how quickly the economy might rebound, and the White House risks exacerbating the already devastating economic impact of the virus by delaying additional emergency assistance.



Few economists outside the White House are talking about a “V” shaped recovery anymore, a scenario in which the economy rebounds just as quickly as it plummeted. Analysts believe major threats to the economy will persist even if states fully relax their public health restrictions because many Americans will not quickly return to work and consumer spending will lag.



The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has projected an unemployment rate of above 10 percent for 2020 and 2021. Goldman Sachs has similarly projected the unemployment rate could remain at 10 percent by the end of this year, even with an additional aid package.

Powell has urged Congress and Trump to consider spending more money to aid the economy. In the “60 Minutes” interview broadcast Sunday, he urged lawmakers to focus on helping the unemployed pay their bills and assisting small businesses, many of which can only partially reopen. He warned the recovery is likely to be slow and could take until the end of 2021.



“If we let people be out of work for long periods of time, if we let businesses fail unnecessarily, waves of them, there’ll be longer-term damage to the economy. The recovery will be slower,” Powell said in the “60 Minutes” interview. “The good news is we can avoid that by providing more support now.""



The White House appears to be unlikely to approve help soon. Administration officials aren’t engaged in serious negotiations with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) over the $3 trillion aid package approved by the House on Friday, according to a congressional aide.

The rate of economic growth probably will increase in the third quarter, analysts say, but even a dramatic increase may be insignificant given the steep contraction in the period from April to June. Among economists at big companies, 86 percent expect the U.S. economy will decline between March 2020 and March 2021, according to a survey of more than 100 economists last month who are part of the National Association of Business Economics.



“What matters to people is not GDP rates, seasonally adjusted at an annual growth rate,” said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan. “It is the labor market and unemployment and jobs. And it’s very likely that, by the end of the year, the unemployment rate could still be north of 10 percent.”



When the unemployment rate is high, Americans tend to pull back markedly on spending, which creates a huge drag on the economy. It can take a long time for consumer confidence to recover, a necessary step before Americans begin resuming sizable purchases.

On Monday, White House officials voiced increasing optimism about the economic recovery despite these dire predictions. Larry Kudlow, director of the White House’s National Economic Council, cited improvements in housing and gasoline demand, as well as an increase in the New York State manufacturing index.



“Unemployment claims look terrible, but they look a lot less terrible,” Kudlow said at a White House event with restaurant executives. “Things are starting to turn — that’s my take.”



Trump has for weeks been the leading cheerleader of a rapid economic recovery, saying in early April it will take off “like a rocket ship” after the virus is contained. The president’s confidence in a “spectacular” economic comeback is shared by White House officials, said Stephen Moore, an economic adviser to the White House at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank.

“From the people at the White House I talked to over the weekend, there’s a renewed sense of optimism that things are working out,” Moore said. “They feel like the direction of things is good, very positive, in terms of the sense of crisis is lessening, and that this is playing up pretty much as had been hoped.”



White House officials have maintained they will step in and approve more aid if subsequent economic data shows it is necessary. Mnuchin has also proved willing to negotiate with congressional Democrats, helping to spearhead the $2 trillion Cares Act passed in March.



Hassett said existing federal efforts have involved “really, really big — massive interventions” bigger than the efforts in the New Deal of the 1930s.

“It’s at least appropriate to see how they go,” Hassett said.

Some White House officials have also quietly signaled their openness to additional aid for states and cities, despite internal angst among some senior advisers about the growing deficit, suggesting the administration’s flexibility on additional spending measures. There is growing concern that state budget cuts could lead to large numbers of layoffs, which could create major political problems ahead of the presidential election in November.



“I don’t think, politically, that Senate Republicans or the White House can withstand the pressure from more bad economic news and the media drumbeat suggesting more help needs to come,” one senior Republican aide said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to frankly describe internal dynamics.

Some economists warn that delaying relief measures now could mean more economic pain for Americans later, arguing the White House does not have time to waste.

Claudia Sahm, who served as an economist at the Council of Economic Advisers under the Obama administration, says unemployment could rise above 30 percent without trillions more in emergency federal spending. Downplaying the extent of the economic carnage may be what the president wants to hear, Sahm said, but it could backfire if it results in slower federal action.

Trump and Kudlow have minimized or downplayed the economic threat posed by the coronavirus since the outbreak began in the United States in February, predictions that have since proved incorrect. Kudlow said in late February that the U.S. had a “pretty close to airtight” containment of the virus, which proved untrue.

At the time, the stock market appeared to be ignoring the upbeat statements from White House officials as it fell precipitously. Lately, though, the market appears to be sharing some of the White House’s optimism, even if other measurements of the economy paint a much different picture.",real

This has been a common theme throughout the US as well as the World.

Reflect On: Is the new coronavirus being made out to be more dangerous than it actually is? Are the death numbers even accurate? Why has there been so much controversy and so much evidence of foul play?

The idea that deaths being attributed to the new coronavirus are greatly inflated has been a common theme all around the world for the past month or so, and it’s gaining even more traction. There are many reasons why this belief has been circulating, and one of them is the fact that health professionals, as well as those within politics, have been emphasizing this point.

For example, not long ago Dr. Ngozi Ezike, Director of the Illinois Department of Public Health stated that, even if it’s clear one died of an alternative cause, their death will still be marked as a COVID death. She explained that this is how coronavirus deaths were being calculated and was quite clear about it.

Vittorio Sgarbi, an Italian politician and Mayor of Sutri gave an emotional speech at a hearing on the 24th of April. He emphasized that the number of deaths in Italy due to COVID-19 are completely false and that the people are being lied to so that the government could impose more authoritarian measures on the citizenry. According to a study out of Italy, 99% of Italy’s coronavirus fatalities that were examined specifically for this study were people who suffered from previous medical conditions. More than 75% had high blood pressure, about 35% had diabetes and a third suffered from heart disease. The study provides insight as to why their death rate may be much higher compared to other countries.

The point is, there are a number of examples as to why coronavirus deaths around the world might be very inflated. What’s listed above isn’t even the tip of the iceberg. You can read more about this topic and other examples I’ve written about, here.

The Colorado Example

The latest example of this comes from state Rep. Mark Baisley, who asked asked 18th Judicial District Attorney George Brauchler to investigate whether the Colorado Department of Public Health & Environment (CDPHE) broke the law by classifying several deaths at a Centennial senior living facility as coronavirus deaths when they really weren’t the result of the coronavirus, as first reported by 9News. In a separate report by CBS4, Montezuma County Coroner George Deavers said CDPHE classified an alcohol-poisoning death in his county as a coronavirus death. Both men accused CDPHE of changing death certificates to add COVID-19.

“Falsely inflating the number of deaths due to COVID-19 adversely impacts the professional reputation of nursing homes, hospitals and healthcare workers while creating undue fear for families.” – Baisley

The number of deaths attributed to the coronavirus in Colorado recently passed 1,000, but after these accusations were made by Baisely, the CDPHE has stated that the number does not actually represent the number of people that have died due to the new coronavirus.

Are they simply trying to cover their tracks? Were they instructed to classify deaths as a result of the new coronavirus just because someone who dies of another cause simply dies with the coronavirus? Are they simply correcting and clarifying confusing data? Why is there so much confusion? Why are death numbers including people who didn’t actually die as a result of COVID-19? Why are changes being made to the Colorado numbers only when these facts are being brought to light, and are the revised numbers even accurate?

According to Dr. Eric France, CDPHE’s chief medical officer, the state’s surveillance-system reporting is in line with federal guidance and matches how other states are also reporting deaths. He also said that changes to clarify its public death-reporting have changed. The CDPHE has announced that going forward, cases in which people had COVID-19 and died of another cause will be recorded separately from the deaths that were caused by COVID-19.

But how many deaths have been attributed to this disease have already been used for the “official” statistics?

The issue even drew a pointed response from Gov. Jared Polis at his own news conference on Friday. “What the people of Colorado want to know is not who died with COVID-19, but who died of COVID-19,” said Polis.

Another interesting thing to note is that multiple studies have found that the infection rate of the new coronavirus is significantly higher than what’s been recorded, meaning that the infection fatality rate, according to these studies, is in the same ball park as seasonal influenza. With death numbers also coming into question, fewer deaths from the coronavirus would drive infection fatality rate even lower.

Furthermore, controversy has surrounded the testing kits, many have been found to be contaminated with the virus and other bacteria, and the Tanzanian president expressed that fruit they tested with the kits came back as positive, hinting to foul play and corruption.

The Takeaway

Never in history have we seen so much controversy surrounding a major global event since 9/11. Edward Snowden also recently expressed that many measures were put into place after 9/11 that still remain until this day, sharing his belief that governments are using the coronavirus to push even more authoritarian measures upon the citizenry. You have to ask yourself, why are some of the world’s leading scientists/epidemiologists in the field, as well as many doctors, getting censored for simply sharing their research and opinions. Why are their YouTube videos taken down, and why have people like Bill Gates become the official health authority regarding the coronavirus, what’s going on and the actions humanity should implement? This alone should raise a red flag for people.

I’ve said it many times, and I’ll say it again, there is a digital authoritarian Orwellian “fact-checker” going around the internet and censoring so much information. This effort is combined with a digital campaign of hate and absolute ridicule of anything that provides an opposing view/narrative in order to sway minds and control human consciousness.",fake

Updated at on Friday at 1:30 p.m. ET

President Trump on Friday signed Congress' latest coronavirus economic relief package, which includes additional aid to small businesses and hospitals.

The measure passed overwhelmingly in the House on Thursday — 388-5, with one lawmaker voting present.

The five lawmakers who voted against the package included one Democrat — Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York — and four Republicans — Reps. Andy Biggs of Arizona, Jody Hice of Georgia, Ken Buck of Colorado and Thomas Massie of Kentucky.

""We have our differences, but we are coming together on this particular bill, and I am proud of that,"" said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who made the case for ongoing, robust federal intervention as the only way out of the crisis. Pelosi on Thursday wore a white scarf to cover her face, but lowered it to speak on the House floor.

""I think that we have to do whatever we can to recognize that public policy has a role here, that governance carries with it responsibilities and opportunity and results and progress for the American people,"" she said. ""And that science and governance are the answers to meeting the health care needs and meeting the needs of our economy as we go forward.""

The Senate passed the measure by unanimous consent on Tuesday.

The details

The $484 billion package includes an additional $321 billion for the newly created Paycheck Protection Program, a lending program designed to help small businesses stay afloat with forgivable loans during the crisis. PPP was popular and ran out of its initial influx of $350 billion in just two weeks. It is likely the program will need additional funding. Republicans have criticized Democrats for holding up the bill — initially a stand-alone $250 billion request to fund PPP.

In the end, Democrats secured an additional $60 billion carved out for smaller banks to assist businesses, many minority-owned, that have struggled to borrow from bigger lenders. It also includes $100 billion Democrats sought for hospitals and more testing.

They were unsuccessful, however, in their efforts to include additional resources for state and local governments — a fight they vowed to carry on to the next round of funding talks.

""There will not be another bill without state and local government"" resources in it,"" Pelosi said on Friday.

Social distancing during votes

The House debate on Thursday included stark images reflective of the time: House Chaplain Patrick Conroy delivered the opening prayer wearing a yellow mask, as did most lawmakers and aides who appeared in the chamber. The visitors' galleries, normally open to the public, were closed.

It was the first roll call vote in the House since it approved a prior coronavirus relief bill on March 14. After that vote, two lawmakers fell ill and about a dozen others self-quarantined as a result. One of those quarantined members, Rep. Joe Cunningham, D-S.C., later tested positive for COVID-19. House leaders installed more aggressive social distancing guidelines for today's votes.

""We should be mindful of the people surrounding us,"" said House Rules Chairman Jim McGovern, D-Mass., who is leading an ongoing effort to find ways to allow lawmakers to vote and hold hearings remotely.

Members were directed to vote in smaller groups broken down by alphabetical order for each vote. Between floor speeches and votes, lawmakers were asked to stay in their offices. And members were asked to vote by machine and not a manual card that requires more contact. Short recesses were held between debates and votes to clean the chamber.

The pandemic also continues to affect lawmakers personally. Financial Services Chairwoman Maxine Waters, D-Calif., announced on the House floor that her sister is hospitalized with COVID-19. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., announced that her eldest brother died from the virus on Tuesday.

Next up

This is the fourth measure Congress has approved since March 1 to confront coronavirus and the economic fallout. While all four enjoyed fast, bipartisan support, there are signals that the parties are retreating to more familiar partisan lines for an anticipated fifth package.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has said he wants a ""pause"" before Congress considers additional legislation, and that it is unlikely additional measures will be able to pass the Senate by unanimous consent, which is generally reserved for noncontroversial bills. He has also indicated he will oppose any no-strings-attached funding for states and that he supports a new legal channel for states to declare bankruptcy to address their fiscal woes.

Among the measures Congress is expected to debate for inclusion in future legislation is funding for state and local governments to make up for budget shortfalls, additional cash payments to American workers and families, extended unemployment benefits, aid for the U.S. Postal Service and first responders, and new infrastructure spending.",real

Opinion contributors

As the pressure to reopen the economy intensifies, business leaders are searching for ways to reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection for their workers and customers. An alluring idea is to offer testing on site, keeping those who are positive out of the workplace.

Testing seems to offer a combination of confidence building for employees and liability protection for companies. Some employers are even pursuing mandatory testing, which is permitted by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.

So, should universal testing in the workplace become part of the new normal?

Not yet. Given technical and resource limitations, testing is no more than one piece of the puzzle of infection prevention and control. There are three major reasons why it would be a mistake for employers to rely heavily or exclusively on testing for safety:

Social distancing vital even with tests

►Sufficient testing is difficult to put in place at even moderate scale. Testing for active SARS-CoV-2 infection is based on identifying the genetic material of the virus in a sample taken from the back of the throat or the nose. (Saliva testing also is promising.) For one person at a time, with certain machines, results are possible within as little as 15 minutes. When dozens or hundreds of samples are needed, however, samples need to be run in tandem on larger machines, and the results are likely to take hours.

If you ask people to wait a day for the results, that’s another day when latent infection could manifest itself, and another test would be needed. And so on. New rapid “antigen” tests are unlikely to solve this problem, given weaknesses with their accuracy.

Pooling saliva samples from the whole workplace is a potential way to search for the coronavirus at lower cost. This strategy, however, takes additional time for sample collection and laboratory work. It also requires follow-up testing should the pooled sample prove positive.

►Negative test results do not eliminate the risk of COVID-19 transmission in the workplace. The accuracy of the test depends on when it is performed in an individual’s course of infection. Many asymptomatic people with SARS-CoV-2 infection could test negative — especially if they are in the pre-symptomatic but infectious phase. As a result, even the world’s most robust testing program would not eliminate the need for social distancing within an office or retail setting. One missed infection in someone who attends a packed staff meeting will require the whole office to quarantine.

COVID protection: Workplaces aren't ready for mass reopening. First we need standards to keep workers safe.

►Employer testing at scale could lead to shortages of testing supplies and compromise the ability of health care facilities to test people who develop symptoms. Consultants offering testing to businesses may go straight to suppliers of swabs, reagents and testing machines and outbid public health agencies and clinics. If even a fraction of workplaces attempts regular testing, the demands could far exceed capacity.

Less testing of those at greatest risk of infection will mean fewer opportunities for isolation, contact tracing and quarantine, the core components of controlling community spread. As cases in a community rise, so too will the likelihood of infections penetrating every workplace.

Sick leave, screenings and ventilation

Rather than as a magic wand, employers should look at testing as a potential piece of a comprehensive infection prevention and control strategy.

Employers should provide generous sick leave and quarantine benefits, screen employees and customers for symptoms before they come to the workplace, and reengineer the work environment to maintain at least 6 feet of distance and high levels of ventilation. They should focus on ways to promote hand hygiene, social distancing, environmental disinfection, and rapid identification and contact tracing for employees who develop COVID-19.

False choice:Protesters should demand coronavirus safety and a reopened economy. We can have both.

Regular testing is most appropriate for small cohorts of people who are unable to socially distance at work and who are exposed to the public in close quarters. Indeed, such testing could prove to be of high utility in very high-risk settings, such as nursing homes. Broad testing is also important in the setting of an outbreak, as directed by public health agencies.

Testing alone, however, is insufficient as an infection prevention and control strategy. A test might find the novel coronavirus, but only careful planning, policy changes, reengineering the workplace and social distancing can stop it from spreading. There are no shortcuts to defeating COVID-19.

On May 1st, hourly employees — a vast majority of which are among the company’s 250,000 or so warehouse workers who cannot work from home — must request an unpaid leave of absence to continue staying home if they do not want to work out of fear for their safety during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Throughout the coronavirus crisis, Amazon’s hourly workers in its fulfillment centers and warehouses have been able to stay home without pay and retain their jobs. For those who were reporting to work and became sick, or who came into contact with someone who tested positive for the virus, Amazon has been offering two weeks of paid time off.

“If any team members are unable or unwilling to work a scheduled shift, they can use unlimited unpaid time off through the month of April without penalty, and we are supportive if someone chooses to stay home,” reads Amazon’s original March blog post outlining its worker safety measures.

Amazon says people who live with or are themselves high-risk individuals will be eligible for leave

Amazon now says employees must start reporting to work or request leave, and the requirements for leave include having an existing health condition or living with someone who does, the logic being such individuals are high-risk for complications due to COVID-19. Everyone else will need to report to work, according to Bloomberg.

It is unclear if workers who are not eligible for such leave but who choose to not show up for work anyway will be subject to termination. The policy will, however, apply to both part-time and full-time workers, Bloomberg reports. Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The company also said back in March it would be increasing its hourly wages by $2 per hour for workers in Canada, the UK, the US, and various parts of Europe. That bumped pay for hourly employees from the minimum of $15 an hour the company set back in October 2018 up to $17. Earlier today, Amazon announced an extension on that temporary pay increase from the end of April to May 16th. The company says the cost of its pay increases is estimated to be $700 million.

“We’ve extended the increased hourly pay outlined below through May 16. We are also extending double overtime pay in the U.S. and Canada. These extensions increase our total investment in pay during COVID-19 to nearly $700 million for our hourly employees and partners,” reads an update to Amazon’s blog post on worker safety measures it published today.

“In addition, we are providing flexibility with leave of absence options, including expanding the policy to cover COVID-19 circumstances, such as high-risk individuals or school closures,” the update goes on to say. “We continue to see heavy demand during this difficult time and the team is doing incredible work for our customers and the community.”",real

Eales says MLS is more fortunate than other leagues around the world that play the traditional fall-to-spring schedule and may have trouble completing their seasons in such a compressed time frame.

MLS was just two weeks into its season when play was halted March 12 because of the pandemic. The league has set a tentative return date of May 10, though the growing death toll in the United States could force that date to be pushed back.

Eales says everything is on the table, including the possibility of resuming league play in empty stadiums.

“We’re fortunate that we had just started our season,” he said Monday during a teleconference with Atlanta media. “We have the whole calendar year to reschedule the games we missed. The emphasis is on playing all 34 games plus the playoffs.”

MLS will likely schedule more midweek games and push back its MLS Cup championship game into mid-December in a bid to play a full season, according to Eales. He added that the playoffs could begin in mid-November — around the time MLS had been planning its title game.",real

Her minions did it just as unemployment hits double digits, so with the job market collapsed, these newly laid off staffers can get ready for new careers as Walmart greeters and Amazon deliverymen.

They're hopping mad about it. Here's Forbes:

Laurene Powell Jobs, the majority owner of The Atlantic magazine, is worth an estimated $19.5 billion — a gain of $3.1 billion since mid-March. Despite the gain, The Atlantic, the publication in which she has a controlling stake, announced plans this week to lay off 20% of its staff, making Powell Jobs the latest billionaire to face questions about obligations to workers in the face of a ruinous pandemic. In a letter to the magazine's staff, chairman David Bradley said, ""We are informing 68 of our colleagues that we will not have a place for them on The Atlantic's new course. The contraction affects mainly our events, sales, and editorial staffs."" Bradley added that the company will freeze pay for its remaining staffers through the rest of the year, and that executives will take a pay cut. The news stirred agitation on social media, particularly within media circles. ""Laurene Powell Jobs, the billionaire majority owner of The Atlantic, is rich enough to be able to pay the salaries of all 68 laid off Atlantic staffers every year for the next 3,000 years,"" wrote Zach Schonfeld, a freelance writer and former Newsweek staffer, in one of many critical posts.

Layoffs are about par for the news industry, which is seeing horrific losses as ad revenue collapses. But for the denizens of The Atlantic, it's more bitter than for the others.

Unlike other people in the news industry, they thought they were shielded from those market forces. That's because instead of dreaded shareholders, Laurene was doing the financing herself through her lefty Emerson Collective. She drew a lot of gooey praise for it, and the Atlantic came to be viewed as a plum spot in journalism, a place where people like Anne Applebaum and David Frum and Ben Rhodes could go to write lefty columns. Here's the masthead. Laurene was there for all of them because she was sugar momma.

Here's one Atlantic Media naïf expressing that very confidence just two months ago on Glass Door:

No need to maximize quarterly growth for shareholders? This person thought Laurene Powell Jobs was the good guy and wicked shareholders were the problem. She'd protect them from dreaded market forces, see, because of all her money, and of course, because she was a lefty, which automatically made her ""compassionate."" He didn't know her very well.

Last time Powell Jobs was in the news, she had disinherited her own kids, pontificating against accumulated wealth — for other people, that is, not herself — and she was going to teach those kids that lesson. Could any employee really think he'd be treated more gently? Sink or swim — that's her only message to those around her. You're all dispensable.

Reality check for El Naivo: Laurene is the Ultimate Dreaded Shareholder, the shareholder of leftists' fevered imaginations, demanding her profit, goodwill be damned. Employees are just replaceable cogs in her mind, so easy to kick a few of them into the streets in a pandemic. She doesn't need anyone's goodwill or good opinion. Like billionaire Michael Bloomberg (estimated wealth: $60 billion), she appeared to be a sort of protection from market forces, but actually, she was quite a bit worse than the market force, which has some counterbalancing features such as the need to retain talent. Not her. And unlike Bloomberg, who at least paid them well while they were there, she paid them a pittance, lower than average salaries in the business, according to these Glass Door reviews, with Atlantic editorial fellows, a glorified intern position for some, a particularly exploited bunch. The review says they didn't even get their birthdays celebrated.

As for Laurene, pay no attention to that extra $3.1 billion she's accumulated into her shareholding portfolio just since the coronavirus lockdowns.

Fact is, if she really cared about her magazine's employees, she could easily cough up enough to keep them on payroll, particularly since they are low-paid. But she doesn't.

Like Michael Bloomberg, she's dined out on projecting the impression that she'd always be there to take care of her employees, quite impervious to market forces, and anyone lucky enough to get a slot at The Atlantic would be set for life. Better still, she's a lefty, so all the lefties flocked to her, the true conservatives were booted out, and the magazine itself became a wretched shadow of its former brilliant self, gobbled up in political correctness. Kevin Williamson, the National Review writer who had been poised to take a position there before he was drummed out on outrageous political correctness grounds, must right about now be thinking he dodged a bullet. The other lefties didn't.

That's why this is schadenfreude. Powell projected all the bad attributes of leftwingery and none of the purported generosity. Lefty billionaires in fact see themselves as exempt from human compassion, even as they present themselves as the wonderful alternative to capitalism. Ace, at Ace of Spades, has some additional skewerings here.

Well, now the staffers know about that. Powell of course is the bigger bad guy here than they are, but how they promoted this hag and her ideas against capitalism, thinking they would be protected. What a delusion that was. There's no one so cold-hearted out there as a far-left billionaire.",fake

The safety of elected officials during the pandemic is front and center now that a valet to President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence’s press secretary — whose husband is one of Trump’s closest advisers — have tested positive for the coronavirus.

Gov. J.B. Pritzker is working from his Gold Coast mansion after a member of his senior staff tested positive for COVID-19.

The infected staffer worked “down the hall” from the governor and attended daily meetings with Pritzker at the Thompson Center while following safety protocols, including wearing face masks, maintaining social distance and undergoing daily temperature checks, the governor said.

Across the street at City Hall, Lightfoot has taken similar precautions with employees in the mayor’s office.

“We have not had any cases amongst the senior staff. But like every other organization, we’ve had someone in the kind of larger mayor’s office … of over a hundred people,” the mayor said.

“The person was diagnosed, went into quarantine and isolation. We notified all of the people the person had come in contact with. This has been some weeks back. So we have a very specific protocol on how to handle these cases. We are doing temperature checks. And we are looking at other safety measures.”

Lightfoot said most of her staff has been working from home for weeks along with many other employees who normally work out of City Hall.

“We do have a small group that remains in the building. We’re being diligent about who comes in and who doesn’t. Most people are wearing masks. We’ve got hand-sanitizing products all over the office,” the mayor said.

“But we’re also looking at some additional measures, particularly as we start to think about the possibility of bringing staff back to City Hall. Those are ongoing conversations that we’re having.”

The mayor did not say how often she has been tested for the coronavirus or when she was tested last.

Lightfoot is frequently seen wearing a face mask that looks like the Chicago flag, with the words, “Stay Home. Save Lives.” Like the governor, she takes it off while speaking publicly.

On Tuesday, she congratulated 88 new firefighter EMTs by offering elbow bumps.",real
862,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/former-cdc-director-tom-frieden-coronavirus-waves-economy/,2020-05-13,"Former CDC chief Tom Frieden warns of ""many waves"" of COVID-19 if economy reopens too soon","CBS MoneyWatch spoke with Dr. Tom Frieden, who was director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 2009-2017, about the challenge of reopening the American economy even as COVID-19 deaths continue to climb and before any effective treatments are available to combat the disease. This interview has been edited for clarity and length.

As we look for sensible ways to jump-start the battered U.S. economy, which industries should reopen first, and which would you reopen last?

Dr. Tom Frieden: Things that can open first include lower-risk physical businesses like restaurants doing takeout and outdoor recreation. Day care, as well, is enormously important economically, and may be able to reopen relatively soon in this process as long as you keep vulnerable staff and children out and make it clear that children and staff participating could potentially be exposed.

The places that are hardest are places where lots of people are indoors and there is limited space, or where there is lots of travel. Bars, the tourism industry, conventions, conferences, some cultural events, some indoor sporting events are going to be really tough. There may be a way for sporting events with few or no in-person spectators and cultural events with masks on the audience, hand sanitizer and potentially other safety and sanitary features to get back to a newer reality, but it isn't going to be easy.

We have to be careful about things that can backfire if we end up coming out too soon and that result in the substantial spread of the virus. That will be counterproductive to the reopening of the economy.

How will workplaces need to adapt? What will the office of the future look like, for instance?

I do think that, until we have either a vaccine or a highly effective treatment, the workplace will be different. We are going to have to reimagine the workplace and its design for the new reality. That will mean less travel, more telework and fewer meetings. When we do go back to our offices, there will be mandatory hand sanitizer as we enter, no common snack rooms. We'll be physically distancing, even at work, for the foreseeable future.

We will be physically distancing in meetings, and we will avoid communal gatherings. We'll be ensuring people don't come to work sick. De-densifying will be a big part of it — also splitting schedules, days, hours and travel, which defeats the purpose of having people together in one space. But it's a way of starting that limits the risk.

Do you expect many of these changes to be permanent, or only temporary until the virus is under control?

I predict we will see permanent work-from-home options. A lot of people will realize they don't need to rent expensive office space when people can work from home with a similar level of efficiency. I do think more telework and less travel are here to stay for a while. I also think we are inevitably going to see more travel restrictions, and potentially 14-day quarantines when you go to a new country. It's very old-fashioned — it goes back half a millennium or more. But if your country or state or province has gone through a tremendous effort to control the virus, you won't want to allow the unlimited travel of people who may unwittingly spread the virus in your country.

We are also going to have to better accommodate people who are vulnerable to the disease — the elderly and people with underlying health conditions. People who are particularly vulnerable will stay out longer if they can telework. If they can't, they'll need some form of disability so we can get back to work sooner without risking the health of the most vulnerable, and so they don't pay the economic price for that.

You are currently president and CEO of Resolve to Save Lives, a global non-profit that works to prevent death from cardiovascular disease and to stop epidemics. What kinds of changes will you make within your own workplace?

[We redid] our workplace a year ago at Resolve To Save Lives, which is housed within Vital Strategies, and it's largely open plan. There are partitions between desks, but there are lots of small meeting rooms. That's a problem as we put plans in place to reopen. We'll have to convert meeting rooms to individual offices or seal them off, because you can't have small meeting rooms where you are sitting one foot away from each other and have multiple people using the same room throughout the course of day — that's not safe. We have two conference rooms that are large enough for a small meeting with people sitting far apart from one another. We'll have to change the other conference rooms to offices.

Ex-CDC director outlines four key measures to ""go back to new normal""

What are the risks — to public health in the U.S. and to the economy — of reopening too quickly?

We are all anxious to get back out into the new normal, and there are some activities we can do with little-to-no risk. Outdoor activities, for example, are far less risky than indoor activities. But the risk is that if we reopen too soon, we will rekindle infections. It won't be a question of a second wave, but many waves. No one knows how the virus will behave in warm weather. There may be less risk or there may not be. But still, the vast majority of Americans are vulnerable to this virus.

We do have to balance our economy and public health measures, and what we found from around the country and around the world is that the places that implemented public health measures the best also protect their economy the best.

There is a misconception that the major economic harm is from the government orders to stay at home. That's actually not necessarily the case. People are understandably afraid that if they go out to the store, they could get an infection that kills them or a vulnerable parent. Even where physical distancing recommendations are reduced, there is a delay in people going back out. The bigger issue is that we have to come to terms with the fact that this is a bad pandemic and it's just the beginning of a long fight against it.

Many small businesses have been seriously hurt by the shutdown and are understandably eager to reopen their doors. What's your message to them?

If your customers die from an infection they get in your shop, it's not good for your business. So it's in everyone's interest to make a business as safe as possible.

This is not about public health versus the economy. In order to make the economy healthier, we need to control the virus. It's also in the interest of business people to have a strong public health system, so people who may be brewing infection are warned and quarantined and don't come into your shop, and people who are infected are identified and isolated so they don't spread it. The more we box the virus in, the more space there is for us in society.

How important a role will contact tracing play in reopening the economy?

Contact tracing will be very important. We have this blunt tool, which is sheltering in place, and that really drives down the spread of the virus. Then we have more precise but not as strong tools. One toolset is the way we design [workplaces] for the age of COVID, which includes no-touch doors, no-touch elevators and no-touch hand sanitizer. We have partitions and other design solutions to make a safer world.

Another set of inventions are precise tools that are the ""Box It In"" tools. They are to test, isolate, contact trace and quarantine — those are the four corners of our box. If any corner of that box is weak, the virus can get out and spread, but if you are in a workplace and there is a case [of COVID-19] you have to follow the exposure protocols.

How many contact tracers will we need?

If the ratio of contact tracers needed in the U.S. is the same as the number they used in Wuhan, China, it would be about 300,000 people. The exact number depends on the number of cases and the efficiency of the process — how readily people cooperate with the process.

I also think it's important to emphasize that contact tracing is not a simple job. There is a misconception that anyone can do it. It's a hard job that requires people skills, medical knowledge, resourcefulness, the ability to reach people and establish, build and maintain trust. You should also be tech-savvy to reach people and identify their contacts. It will be a major facilitator of economic recovery from the pandemic perspective.

Do you agree with the plan President Trump has set out for gradually reopening the economy, or are we being too hasty?

I think the guidelines outlined by the White House were sensible. They outlined things that are important to track in order to know we are not likely to have an explosion of cases when we reopen.

On the other hand, people are very impatient to go out, and there hasn't been a consistent and clear explanation to the public of what the reasons are for having to stay apart or having to continue to refrain from certain activities. I think that reflects messaging that hasn't been consistent and science-based. If people are impatient to go out, you hope at least when they go out, they will do so as safely as possible.",real

Larry Hogan (R) announced that people who have been exposed to the coronavirus but are not showing symptoms will be able to get tested at several state-run testing sites starting Thursday. No appointment or doctor’s referral will be needed. He also authorized store pharmacies to purchase and administer tests.



Hogan has come under pressure recently from local leaders who say more people need to be tested before their regions can begin to reopen.



“This will help doctors diagnose and treat new cases more quickly, and it will further increase the safety of our state for all citizens,” Hogan said in a statement.

D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) has set up two testing sites in the city, and is especially encouraging people who have symptoms, are front-line workers, live in institutional settings or are 65 or older to get tested.

And Prince William County offered free testing for all county residents Monday and Tuesday — no appointment or symptoms needed.

The U.S. Embassy in China confirmed on Saturday that a 60-year-old American infected with coronavirus died at a hospital in Wuhan on Thursday. It's the first known American death from the outbreak, which has been declared an emergency by the World Health Organization.

""We offer our sincerest condolences to the family on their loss,"" an embassy spokesperson said. ""Out of the respect for the family's privacy, we have no further comment.""

At the latest count the 2019-nCoV virus, which can cause a form of pneumonia, has infected nearly 35,000 people worldwide and killed more than 700, Feng reports.

About 800 Americans and their family members have been evacuated from Wuhan, where the coronavirus outbreak originated and where the vast majority of known cases have been. They are being kept in quarantine on U.S. military bases, under the care of doctors from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

It's not known why this patient was not among the evacuees.

The CDC reports that as of Friday, 12 cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in the U.S. across six states: Arizona, California, Illinois, Massachusetts, Washington and Wisconsin.

1847,https://dcdirtylaundry.com/fact-coronavirus-vaccines-will-contain-aborted-human-babies/,2020-05-23,FACT: Coronavirus vaccines will contain aborted human babies,"(Natural News) Pro-lifers everywhere had better think long and hard about what they plan to do in the event that state or local governments try to mandate vaccination for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) once a jab is commercially released because chances are those syringes will contain the remnants of aborted babies.

Even though President Trump has said that Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines will not be mandated at the federal level, there is still the possibility that some states may try to force them locally, which will put not just those opposed to vaccination in a tough position but also those who recognize the sanctity of unborn human life.

After it was announced recently that Canada’s largest federal research and development organization has teamed up with a Chinese vaccine company to test a new trial coronavirus vaccine in Canada, Dr. Alan Moy, M.D., founder and scientific director of the John Paul II Medical Research Institute and CEO of Cellular Engineering Technologies decided to do some digging, upon which he discovered that the test vaccine in question is made from aborted fetal cell lines.

CanSino Biologics Inc., also known as CanSinoBIO, is the name of the Chinese firm that partnered up with Canada’s National Research Council (NRC) to conduct trials on Ad5-nCoV, as it is being called, which Dr. Moy found contains a cell line known as HEK293 that was derived from unborn children that were murdered while still inside their mothers’ wombs.

“Since it’s using an adenovirus replication-defective vector, it is using HEK293,” Dr. Moy told LifeSiteNews. “HEK293 is an aborted fetal cell line.”

What’s worse, Ad5-nCoV probably won’t even work

Besides its unethical origins, the Ad5-nCoV more than likely will not even work as promised, Dr. Moy warns. As it turns out, there is a high incidence of immunity against Ad5, so most of the people who are injected with it will confer no protection whatsoever against the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).

“I don’t envy Canadians,” Dr. Moy is further quoted as saying. “Your government and PM (prime minister) have mandated draconian policies that are anti-life … Not a good vaccine solution if pro-life or pro-choice.”

What is further confounding is the fact that Canada would even agree to contract with a vaccine company based out of China, which is where this whole crisis originated. Ad5-nCoV was reportedly also co-developed by the Beijing Institute of Biotechnology which, like all other Chinese institutions, is governed and controlled by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).

This vaccine is said to be the first “phase 2” coronavirus vaccine, meaning it has been approved to be “safely” used in human test subjects. And the Canadian government could not be more excited about the prospect of injecting as many Canadians as possible with it to “cure” them of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).

“NRC is proud of our ongoing partnership with CanSino Biologics,” stated NRC President Iain Stewart in a recent press release.

Dr. Xuefeng Yu, chairman and CEO of CanSinoBIO, also stated in the same press release that his company has “strong connections to Canada” and is “proud to be building on past successes and continuing our ongoing partnership with the NRC to address health needs on a global scale.”

Amazingly, both the NRC and CanSinoBIO are proud of their proprietary HEK293 aborted baby cell line, which they say will help “to advance a scale-up production process for the vaccine candidate.” In other words, thanks to these aborted babies, Canada and China will be able to produce Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines for mass distribution much faster than normal, paving the way for a global vaccination campaign unlike anything the world has ever seen.

So what does it feel like to undergo one of the not-yet-widely-available nasal swab tests for COVID-19?

With testing still limited, we can’t offer a firsthand report. But Dr. Jayant Pinto can.

“It’s not comfortable, I’ll just be honest,” says Pinto, a University of Chicago Medicine otolaryngologist who’s had similar tests done on himself. “There’s a little discomfort. It’s not long-lasting. It’ll sting for a minute.”

It isn’t pain like you feel from a shot. Instead, think about how it felt if you’ve gotten chlorinated water up your nose in a swimming pool.

The complex nerve endings in your nose told your brain: That’s not right, there’s something bad in there. And that burning sensation makes you want to blow the water right back out.

Well, the swab test for COVID-19 is more intense than that.

“It’s a deep burning, and it often elicits tears and sometimes coughing,” says Molly K. Erickson, a nurse practitioner at Rush University Medical Center who helped set up the Chicago hospital’s testing sites. “That discomfort really comes with getting an adequate sample.”

So, if you didn’t feel anything, it means the test probably wasn’t done right.

There are several types of coronavirus tests. All involve collecting a sample using a swab.

That’s followed by molecular analysis to look for the presence of the virus’ genetic material.

Blood tests, in contrast, look for a person’s antibodies to a virus, which show past exposure and possibly future immunity. So far, one blood test for coronavirus has been approved by the U.S. government. Others are under development.

Most swab tests aim for the virus’ preferred hiding spots in the nasopharynx, located about seven centimeters straight back into the nose, or in the turbinate area, about 2.5 centimeters inside the nose.

The person administering the test will wear PPE — personal protective equipment — including a mask, face shield and gown, to protect against possible exposure from your breath or a sudden sneeze or any airborne particles that get stirred up.

Once the swab is inserted, it needs to be swirled around for about 15 seconds. Depending on the test, the same thing might also be done through your other nostril.

The discomfort you feel typically goes away quickly, and there’s usually no bleeding.

President Donald Trump, who’s been tested at least twice, described it as “not something I want to do every day, I can tell you that.”

U.S. testing got a boost late last month when Abbott Laboratories, based in Lake County, was given expedited approval by the federal Food and Drug Administration to roll out its new rapid COVID-19 test. It uses a portable machine about the size of a toaster to provide results quickly — as quickly as five minutes for a positive result and 13 minutes for a negative result.

The White House was one of the first locations to get the Abbott tests. Since the beginning of April, guests visiting Trump and Vice President Mike Pence have been required to get a test even if they feel healthy, the Washington Post reported.

Most other people will have to wait a bit longer. Chicago-area facilities using the new Abbott test or other types of COVID-19 tests are offering them only to patients who go through a screening process and are found to have symptoms or to medical personnel and first-responders.

Erickson says Rush is using a combination of the Abbott kits, its own in-house tests and tests sent to private labs. The testing process is “very orchestrated” and not set up for walk-in visits by the public. Everyone must first be screened via a video visit or by a clinic, emergency room or hospital personnel and deemed a good candidate for testing.

Dr. Warren Wollin, senior director of Physicians Immediate Care, which has five drive-up centers in Chicago and elsewhere in northern Illinois, says the tests are limited to screened, symptomatic patients and first-responders.

“We try to keep it as low-risk as possible by keeping it outside the clinic,” Wollin says of the drive-up sites.

With the rapid test, patients get results while they wait in their cars, and medical professionals can act immediately if someone needs urgent care, Wollin says. Those who test positive but aren’t feeling ill might be directed to have a telehealth visit online.

What isn’t known yet: exactly how accurate the various COVID-19 tests are. Normally, reems of data have to be submitted to the FDA before a test is approved. But the usually stringent requirements were waived to more quickly bring testing to the public.",real
307,https://chicago.suntimes.com/2020/4/13/21219273/coronavirus-covid-19-medicare-medicaid-bankruptcy-suntimes,2020-04-13,"In the aftermath of COVID-19, expanding Medicare, Medicaid could save lives","Many American states and municipalities have instituted measures to slow the spread of COVID-19 and “flatten the curve” of the estimated morbidity and mortality that may occur in the United States.

These measures include closing “non-essential” businesses, schools, universities and public services for a specified time period. Other measures focus on “social distancing” and prohibiting meetings, sports events and other public gatherings.

Opinion

Despite our best preventive health measures, thousands of people are expected to be hospitalized. This will be expensive.

ProPublica and the Harvard Global Health Institute have recently released a fascinating analysis of U.S. national, regional and municipal hospital capacity and how it relates to COVID-19.

The report looks at U.S. hospital capacity under various scenarios. The report asks what would happen to an area’s hospital capacity if 20%, 40% or 60% of an area’s population were infected with COVID-19 over a six-month, 12-month or 18-month interval.

For example, Chicago would reach approximately 120% of total hospital capacity if 20% of the population were infected in six months, according to this model. However, if 20% of Chicago’s population were infected over 18 months, hospital capacity would not be reached.

Many of those who have been infected with COVID-19 will be admitted to intensive care units with respiratory failure and will require support with mechanical ventilators.

The health insurance dilemma caused by unemployment

A majority of Americans receive their health insurance through their jobs. But on April 2, the U.S. Department of Labor reported that over 6 million people filed for unemployment benefits.

Many of these people have lost their health insurance and have joined the ranks of the approximately 28 million Americans who had no health insurance prior to the COVID-19 crisis.

It has been estimated that just one hospitalization for COVID-19 may range from $38,000 to $74,000. So not only must families worry about contracting COVID-19, they may also have to worry about being uninsured and, if someone becomes ill, potentially having to take dire financial steps, including filing for bankruptcy.

A potential solution

The Trump administration has recently stated that it would help hospitals by providing coverage for uninsured COVID-19 patients. But a better way to solve this problem might be to look at two very successful health programs — Medicare and Medicaid. These two programs could be expanded. The expansion would cover many of those uninsured Americans.

While the Trump administration’s plan to help uninsured COVID-19 patients is laudable, the plan does little to help uninsured patients who have other health issues requiring hospitalization. Here are a couple of suggestions to fix things:

• Consider lowering the age of Medicare eligibility to 60 years. This would help those working people who are not old enough to have Medicare eligibility, which begins at age 65.

• Relax the criteria for Medicaid eligibility. This can be done through an 1115 waiver. This provision allows a state to request additional funding and flexibility in determining eligibility in providing care to those who qualify for Medicaid. Gov. J.B. Pritzker has applied for a such a waiver for Illinois.

Both these steps will help us be better prepared for health care in the COVID-19 era . . . and the post-COVID-19 era.

We need to pressure the Congress and the Trump administration to address the long-term issue of health care and the uninsured by expanding eligibility for Medicare and Medicaid.

Subscribe here .

Oh hey, today is our 500th issue! Thanks to everyone who has been with us from the beginning, and each of you who has joined along the way. We can’t imagine a better use of our time during this weird era than bringing you news and analysis of the day’s big moments in tech, democracy, and the pandemic.

One result of the COVID-19 pandemic has been that big tech companies, which long have been reluctant to intervene in questions of content moderation, have quickly become much more aggressive. At Google, for example, the company began showing news stories from trusted sources to anyone who searched for information about the virus. It stepped up efforts to remove videos containing misinformation about the pandemic from YouTube.

YouTube also added a “shelf” of high-quality breaking news videos, along with links to the World Health Organization, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and local health authorities. As a result, YouTube says, news consumption is up 75 percent from this time last year, and links to the WHO and CDC have received more than 20 billion impressions.

And on Tuesday, YouTube took a step that, among the big social platforms, has so far only been implemented by Facebook: adding fact-check articles to search results. I wrote about it at The Verge:

YouTube will begin adding informational panels containing information from its network of fact-checkers to videos in the United States, the company said. The panels, which were introduced last year in Brazil and India, appear on searches for topics where fact-checkers have published relevant articles on the subject. The move comes at a time when platforms have seen a surge in misinformation related to COVID-19 and its origin, possible cures, and other subjects. [...] YouTube says “more than a dozen” US publishers are already participating in its network of fact-checkers, including FactCheck.org, PolitiFact, and The Washington Post Fact Checker. The network is open to any publisher that is a member of the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN) and signs its code of principles. Google recently announced that it would donate $1 million to the IFCN.

On Monday afternoon, I spoke with YouTube’s head of product, Neal Mohan, about how the company is navigating several challenges related to the pandemic. We talked about evolving advice from public health organizations, scrubbing bad content from the platform, and the company’s increasing reliance on automated systems for moderation.

“When users are searching on YouTube around a specific claim, we want to give an opportunity for those fact checks to show up right then and there, when our users are looking for information — especially around fast-moving, quickly changing topics like COVID-19,” Mohan told me.

Highlights from our interview are below, edited lightly for clarity and length.

Casey Newton: You rolled out fact checks in Brazil and India last year. What did you learn?

Neal Mohan: We happened to roll it out in India right around the time of their elections last year. Those are the largest elections in the world, and as a result of the number of people that vote, the election itself occurs over the course of a month. So there was time for the potential spread of a lot of misinformation between one election date and another.

We have information panels that we triggered in the case of more evergreen conspiracies, like flat earth and anti-vaccine. But what about fast-moving, changing news events where there might not be a robust Wikipedia article or a CDC entry or an Encyclopedia Britannica article to link to? And so that’s why we leaned on this concept of actually bringing professional fact checkers into our YouTube search results and triggering them there.

And our experience both in India and Brazil was positive. We think that we did our job in terms of curtailing the spread of misinformation in an otherwise sort of pretty flammable environment. Most importantly from my standpoint, we felt that we did right by our users in terms of doing our best to try to prevent this happening in those countries. And that that sort of positive result for our users led us to expand it here in the US. And our goal is not to just stop at these three countries — we want to continue to roll it out in other parts of the world as well.

One challenge of policing information about COVID-19 is that the disease itself is new, and the advice we get keeps evolving. In some cases, advice like “don’t wear masks” has changed to “everyone please wear masks.” How should a big tech platform approach that problem?

My perspective there is that we really do have to rely on sources — and in our case, that means channels — that have a track record of being relevant and credible in this space. Yes, lots of guidelines are changing, every single day, every single week. You’re literally seeing science being created on an hourly or daily basis. And so the reason why surfacing authoritative results feels like the best thing that we can do is because even if there’s a change, an authoritative source is going to give the context behind it.

So let’s say there’s a change in mask guidance. I would expect an authoritative news outlet, or a medical authority like the CDC, to give context on it and say, ‘this used to be our guidance, and our new guidance is this, and here’s the reason why.’ Or a news publication covering it says ‘CDC changes its guidelines: this is what they used to say, now they’re saying this, and this is the science that led them to change that.’ And by surfacing authoritative results, I think we’re doing what we can as a platform to deliver the most timely, but also the most credible information to our users.

I know YouTube has also been relying on more automated systems during the past couple months due to challenges with being able to bring third-party vendors into offices. How are you measuring the effect on your moderation decisions?

A lot of of this was really very, very simple, which was protecting the health of our extended workforce. And for me and I think for everybody else here at YouTube and Google, that was really the number one consideration, and frankly everything else we were going to do was going to be secondary.

You and I have talked before about the way that [content moderation] works best is through a combination of machines and machine learning, and the nuanced judgment of well trained raters who do this for a living. Without that second part, we’ve had to rely much more on handling things through appeals. Because there’s a lot of action taken by these machines, sometimes those appeals are impacted in terms of our response time. But generally speaking, we’ve been able to manage this.

Finally, we’re in a situation in which some of the people spreading misinformation about COVID-19 are elected officials. How is YouTube approaching that when it comes to moderation?

Just to be very clear, our community guidelines are based on the content. That applies to the content within the videos, and it also applies to comments and any other surface, if you will, on the YouTube platform. And so they’re not about the speaker. The policies apply equally, whether you or I say something, an elected official does, or a national leader does. This crisis is no different.

One of the enforcement examples that we gave around medical misinformation was explicitly encouraging somebody to flout state or national guidance around a stay-at-home order. And this happened in the case of the Brazilian president.

We removed a couple of videos that happened when there was an explicit call to flout those orders. Of course, you have to strike the right balance. If there are people who have different opinions or would like to express an opinion — in terms of economic trade-offs versus health trade-offs — then that discourse needs to be allowed and protected on our platform. But something that explicitly says, through false information, that stay-at-home doesn’t actually do anything, that would be an example of a policy violation, regardless of who the speaker is.

⭐ In less than a month, Apple and Google launched a contact tracing software toolkit to help health officials trace coronavirus. The project was driven by a handful of dedicated employees. Here’s Christina Farr at CNBC:

That speed of development was highly unusual for Apple, a company obsessed with making its products perfect before releasing them to the world. Project Bubble also required that Apple join forces with its historic rival, Google, to co-develop technology that could be used by health authorities in countries around the world. The software, which Apple and Google now refer to by the softer-sounding term “exposure notification” instead of “contact tracing,” is due to be released on May 1. In recent weeks, the employees have been working nights and weekends to incorporate external feedback. The companies still have their critics, but the transparency has helped them win over some unlikely supporters, including in countries like Germany where officials were initially reluctant to work with Big Tech.

Industry

⭐ Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has overseen a broad shakeup in his board over the past several months. Two directors have left the company, and longtime friend of the CEO has been added. The moves were part of Zuckerberg’s campaign to consolidate decision-making at the company, report The Wall Street Journal’s Deepa Seetharaman and Emily Glazer. (Counterpoint: didn’t Zuckerberg already have near-total control over all things Facebook?)

It is far from certain that Mr. Zuckerberg’s repositioning of Facebook, and his role at the top, will lead to a lasting turnaround in its reputation following more than three years of controversy over the spread of misinformation, loose oversight of user data and the company’s competitive practices. The departure of long-serving directors, along with those of several longtime lieutenants over the past two years, means he is navigating this moment without key advisers who might be able to help him spot potential pitfalls.

Things to do

Stuff to occupy you online during the quarantine.

Take the shower challenge, men! Is it safe for work? No. Is it safe for working from home? Also no.

Watch a late-night talk show held inside Animal Crossing. It’s hosted by the writer of Rogue One.

Attend a virtual prom in Houseparty. It takes place May 7th from 8 to 10PM ET, and will include DJs you can bring into your private chats with friends.

Buy a puzzle. Or do what I do, and play Patterned on the Apple Arcade subscription service. It’s a lot of puzzles for less than the cost of most puzzles.

In the entire country, a record 38.6 million Americans have filed for unemployment during the pandemic. That corresponds to nearly 25% of the entire United States labor force. While many of these folks are receiving unemployment from state and federal government, many others are not.

Millions of Americans — who watched states close non-essential businesses, subsequently crushing their careers — cannot even access unemployment benefits, according to the Economic Policy Institute. While some of these problems have been remedied, for others, collecting unemployment insurance was never an option.

Business owners who were unable to obtain an SBC loan or other forms of COVID-19 government subsistence have been frantically fighting to reopen their business as they watched their life savings go up in flames. The Free Thought Project has reported on multiple instances in which people unable to obtain government support have tried to reopen their businesses to support themselves, only to leave them in handcuffs. It’s a catch-22.

Of those millions of jobless claims in the United States, over a quarter-million of them were in the state of Oklahoma. With a population just under 4 million, 275,000 unemployed residents are massive. While some of these folks have likely sought out and found jobs to support themselves and their families, others have likely endured conditions that may have prevented them from doing so.

As a result of the state shutting down the economy, these unemployed residents of the state have been unable to pay their bills, including their rent and house notes. Now, in spite of the fact that this record spike in unemployment was a function of the state’s COVID-19 measures, Oklahoma is taking action in the form of evictions.

On their Facebook page this week, the Oklahoma County Sheriff’s Office announced that they will begin physically evicting residents unable to pay their bills. It reads as follows:

EVICTION NOTICE UPDATE We know that this will be difficult, but want to give as much notice as possible regarding OCSO deputies serving eviction notices. Deputies will start serving judicial eviction orders this week, and enforcing evictions on May 26, 2020. We understand how tough times are currently for many as a result of the health crisis the past few months, but we must enforce orders issued by the courts. Once the order is served tenants have 48-hours to leave the premises of the residence they are renting/leasing. Please, if you are set for an eviction hearing, attend. Make your case to the judge, the only person who can determine your case. Civil process, and our issuing evictions is mandated by state law: https://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp… We will be compassionate, and respectful during scheduled evictions. We are hopeful that everyone issued an eviction will be able to make living arrangements.

Now, as the inevitable effects of the government’s shutdown order crash the economy and force people to choose between eating and paying their rent, that same government is going to start kicking them out of their homes.

See how that works?

As banks and other large corporations across the country receive hundreds of billions in Federal money — ensuring a lifetime of debt for future generations — Joe Sixpack on Main Street, USA is told to kick rocks.

No one here is advocating for people to be able to squat and exploit this situation to get out of paying their house note or rent. However, that is not the case here. While grocery stores and fast-food restaurants are hiring, other businesses are told they must operate at 25% capacity or remain closed entirely. This is hardly sustainable when it comes to maintaining a decent workforce with substantial pay.

Unfortunately, this is likely the beginning of an economic snowball that will continue to grow as the next few months roll on. As TFTP has predicted from the beginning, the shutdown of the economy will have lasting consequences, unprecedented in nature, and that will be here for a long time. As this case in Oklahoma and countless other ones illustrate, the government’s promise of “safety” almost always ends in human suffering.

24/7 Wall Street

Since the lockdown caused by concerns over the spread of coronavirus, people have been left to their own devices at home, and those include cell phones, laptops, iPads, video games and television remote controls, among others.

Before the pandemic, these devices were frequently used – they are sometimes called high-touch items – and now that so many of us are home, they are being handled even more often, and not necessarily by a single user. That raises the specter of spreading the dreaded coronavirus. It is transmitted via droplets from the nose or mouth when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or exhales.

24/7 Tempo has compiled a list of cleaning tips for your phones, tablets and other devices. We reviewed articles in trade publications, as well as general media sources to create our list.

Those using electronic devices need to clean the plastic and steel surfaces with the proper disinfectants. These are the kinds of surfaces where the coronavirus can survive for up to 72 hours. Most of the products used for cleaning might already be available in your home. The American Chemistry Council has a list of EPA-approved products. Soap and hot water is also a safe option that will help reduce the spread of the virus. Obviously, always use common sense when cleaning electronics: unplug them first, do not submerge them, and only use a small amount of cleaner on a cloth so that moisture doesn't enter any openings.

Cell phones

The two leading cell-phone makers updated their websites to inform customers how to clean those devices. Apple said on its website that iPhones can be safely cleaned with disinfectant wipes, including products such as Clorox sheets. Samsung said you can wipe down the device with a microfiber cloth containing an alcohol-based solution (70%). A National Institute of Infectious Disease study of mobile phones from 2017 found a median of more than 17,000 bacterial gene copies on each.

Tablets

A tablet is a portable computer such as an iPad. You can use alcohol-based agents to clean your device and attention should be paid to the screen and buttons. Remove any case on the tablet and clean underneath. When you put the case back on, wipe down the outside of it.

Phone chargers

Cleaning phone chargers to remove dirt and other impurities, as well as viruses, can be tricky. You can use a can of compressed air and spray the air in short bursts into the port. Otherwise, bring the charger to be cleaned by a professional.

Touch screens

Computer touch screens can be cleaned by using a small amount of warm, soapy water or a solution made to specifically clean touch screens. When cleaning, use a microfiber cloth to avoid scratching the screen. Mixing water and rubbing alcohol works, too but any mixture of more than 50% alcohol might damage the screen and remove the coating that protects it from fingerprints.

Keyboards

Keyboards have lots of germs and are potential virus havens. Researchers at the University of Arizona found that the average desktop has 400 times more bacteria than the average toilet seat. A New England Journal of Medicine study showed that the coronavirus was still detectable on plastic and steel for up to 72 hours, meaning viruses can live longer on non-porous surfaces such as keyboards. Keyboards should be unplugged and then shaken. Then they can be cleaned by gently wiping them down by using a 70% alcohol solution or disinfecting wipes. Stay away from bleach and don't let moisture into the openings.

Remote controls

Now that we're sheltering in place, we're watching a lot more television and using the remote control, which can potentially harbor the coronavirus. Among the cleaning agents that are effective for cleaning remote controls are Clorox cleaner and bleach products, Lysol disinfectants, Purell sanitizers, and Zep disinfectants. The American Chemistry Council has a list of products approved by the EPA.

Mouse

Like many devices, your mouse can be cleaned using products such as Clorox cleaner and bleach products, Lysol disinfectants, Purell sanitizers, and Zep disinfectants. Before you start cleaning, unplug your mouse and remove batteries. Researchers have found that the virus can survive for up to three days on plastic and steel, which are commonly used in electronic devices like the mouse.

Monitors

Computer monitors don't receive frequent contact from hands, but viruses can still settle on them so they should be cleaned periodically. Cleaning agents should not come into direct contact with the monitors and instead droplets of the agent should be applied to a microsoft fiber cloth, which can then be used to clean the monitor.

PCs

Personal computers can harbor germs and viruses, and the risk rises as more people use the same device. A study published in the American Journal of Infection Control said bacteria and other potentially hazardous microbes can be present on shared computer terminals and may be transmitted to users. Before cleaning a PC, unplug the device. PCs can be cleaned by using a lint-free cloth made from microfiber. Don't use aerosol sprays or abrasive cleaning agents and don't spray cleaners directly on the computer. Make sure no moisture enters any openings.

Laptops

Often receiving daily use, laptops can be major carriers of germs, thereby potentially spreading bacteria and disease. A 2018 New York Times article recommended laptop users begin by turning the machine off and removing the battery, if easily done, then cleaning out all of the crevices using canned air. The outside can then be wiped down using a microfiber cloth with a few drops of rubbing alcohol added to it – never apply alcohol directly to the computer. The screen can be wiped using a microfiber cloth dampened with plain water.

Nebulizers

Nebulizers are machines that spray medicine as a fine mist via a mouthpiece or mask, and are often used to treat asthma and other lung diseases. As nebulizers generate particles that can carry bacteria and viruses deep into one's lungs, some medical agencies, such as Canada's Alberta Health Services, have recommended their use be avoided during the pandemic. They can be cleaned by rinsing the cup with warm water and allowing it to air dry after each use and washing with warm, soapy water at the end of each day. They should be disinfected at least once per week.

Watches

The coronavirus can linger on the glass surface of watches. To eradicate the virus, use products such as Clorox wipes, alcohol-based sanitizers, or soap to disinfect the surface. Clorox wipes can be used to sterilize Apple Watches, though the company cautions customers not to use the agent on fabric or leather bands and not to use bleach. Infectious disease researchers recommend cleaning wearables such as Fitbit devices frequently.

Headphones

Headphones can collect debris and oil from one's skin, and generally pick up germs throughout the day. Due to their electronic nature, cleaning them can be tricky. One can use a towel with warm water mixed with a drop or two of a mild detergent. A small amount of alcohol may also be used, though depending on the type of headphones being cleaned, alcohol can have damaging effects. If it is used, it should be dried off carefully when done.

E-readers

The supply chain for e-reader companies – including Amazon and Sony – was thrown into disarray in January as the virulence of the coronavirus became known. Researchers have discovered that the virus can live for up to three days on plastic and steel, which are commonly used in electronic devices like e-readers. E-readers should be cleaned with products such as Clorox wipes, alcohol-based sanitizers, or soap and hot water to expunge the virus.

Printers

Printers have become ubiquitous in American homes along with laptops and personal computers and as such can also host the coronavirus. Owners of printers are advised to turn them off before cleaning. They should wear protective disposable rubber or nitrile gloves during cleaning. Areas of the printer that can come in contact with humans – control or cover panels, for example – need to be cleaned with a solution of 70%-plus isopropyl alcohol, although 99.9% isopropyl alcohol is recommended. Don't spray the solution directly on the device – put it on a lint-free rag or cloth. Use a glass cleaner for the copying surface. Before powering up, make sure all surfaces are dry.

Game consoles

Whether you are an XBox One or Playstation aficionado, you need to clean the consoles for these game systems. Game consoles qualify as so-called high-touch areas. Though the coronavirus is spread through droplets emitted by coughing or sneezing, particles can last for up to three days on plastic and steel. They can be cleaned by wiping them down with a 70% alcohol solution or disinfecting wipes. Rubbing alcohol can also be used if Clorox or Lysol wipes are in short supply.

Cameras

With so many people in lockdown, those sheltering in place are recording these extraordinary times in photographs. Shutterbugs need to be aware that bringing a camera to your face also exposes you to germs and viruses. Enthusiasts should wipe down the camera with a soft, dry cloth that contains denatured alcohol.

Fans

Whether or not the new coronavirus is airborne is still up for debate. However, fans – including ceiling fans, window fans, and those on stands – have the potential to spread aerosolized human pathogens. Those in the vicinity of fans can remove dust from the blades using a damp cloth or a vacuum cleaner with attachment. It's also recommended that those most at risk of the dangers of COVID-19 wear a face mask when fans are in use.

ATM machines

ATMs can be exceptionally dirty because of the many fingers touching their screens and keypads, as well as the presence of dollar bills, which are notoriously unclean. Following stay-at-home orders, many banks – including JPMorgan Chase and PNC – closed branches, requiring customers to rely on the machines. According to COVID-19 safety guidelines from the National ATM Council, users should wear disposable gloves or use hand sanitizer for any contact with ATM terminals and cash. They should also follow CDC guidelines, such as washing hands frequently with soap and water, avoiding touching one's face, and maintaining a distance of at least 6 feet from other people.

The merciless threat slipped into America, emptying its streets, shuttering its stores, wrecking its economy and forcing its people to retreat indoors.
In this new country, once crowded cities now feel abandoned, as if everyone suddenly moved out. There is no rush hour on the nation’s highways. “Closed” signs hang from the front doors of business after business.
For many, this coronavirus pandemic involves the most dramatic kind of fight — for life, for food, for money. For others, it can feel absurdly trifling as they stay inside — a fight against boredom, binge eating, isolation.
There was Kalee Kamer, in Portsmouth, Ohio, 27 months sober and motivated to stay that way, participating in a recovery meeting that has moved online. Chris Allison, patrolling the quiet city of Norman, Okla., in a sanitized police vehicle and with a blue face mask. And the Rev. Rob Lee, a pastor in Newton, N.C., without a congregation, summoning hope amid the gloom.
This was America over 24 hours this past week, on pause and full-tilt, as the sun rose and then set and then rose again on a profoundly altered nation.
6:30 a.m.MiamiA trip to a ventanita, in Miami culture, is not just about the $1.82 cup of sweet and foamy cafecito. It is about conversation and gossip, a hangout for nosy retirees and chatty working stiffs. Queuing is taboo. Wriggling and squeezing are the ways to reach the counter.
Or at least they were.
Flouting social distancing rules, crowds continued to congregate outside ventanitas, so much so that the county mayor threatened to shut them down. Sergio’s, where the espresso machine continues to whirl and buzz, rushed to tape markers — six feet apart — on the ground.
Now customers approach with caution, peering through new panes of plexiglass to order. Many scurry off with their provisions tucked in a brown paper bag.
“This is my only outing,” said Daisy Abreu, 58, who works in magazines and left with one café con leche, one guava pastry and two empanadas.
But first she lingered for a moment to check in with Reinaldo Mesa, a 61-year-old airport contractor who picked up coffee and a medianoche sandwich. He, too, had given up most everything in his daily routine. Except the ventanita.— Patricia Mazzei
8 a.m.Erie, Colo.Sherry Maloney rolled out of bed, strapped on a face mask and headed for the Safeway. Today was toilet paper day. Maybe.
Rumor had it that a shipment of paper products had come in the night before. By 6:30 a.m., she was standing outside, shivering with her husband, fingers crossed she would snag a package.
One man was down to three rolls at home. A woman said she was about ready to cut squares out of cloth diapers. “I’ve been rationing two squares a trip,” said Ms. Maloney, 63.
In the grand scheme of things, a toilet paper shortage at home is certainly not the worst crisis. But it is also certainly not normal in a land of plenty.
Inside the locked store, clerks wiped down shopping carts and spritzed the self-checkout stations. Outside, everyone talked about how a trip to the store had devolved into a Hobbesian supermarket sweep. Jostling lines. Frantic customers. Stressed employees, exposed to God knows what germs for God knows how many hours every day.
“It’s starting to get ugly,” Ms. Maloney said. But it was friendly in line this morning. Two buddies ran into each other — “Don’t shake his hand!” one shouted.
The doors slid open, and Ms. Maloney strode inside.— Jack Healy
10 a.m.AtlantaTonnia Blount shifted her big yellow school bus into gear and started off on the route she had been running for a decade, only now with no children to pick up and none to drop off. They were all at home, stuck in little bungalows and apartments scattered across the working-class neighborhoods of southeast Atlanta.
But with nearly four in five Atlanta public school students poor enough to qualify for free or reduced lunch, most still needed their cafeteria calories. So this was Ms. Blount’s work for the foreseeable future: pulling her empty bus in front of Martin Luther King Jr. Middle School, loading it up with brown sacks full of breakfast and lunch, and then delivering the sacks out in the maze of narrow streets, more like the driver of an ice-cream truck.
“I know my children,” she said. “I know who is in need.”
Every few blocks, Ms. Blount, 55, stopped the bus and honked until the parents and grandparents and aunties came out. “How many babies?” a co-worker in the back of the bus would ask them, smiling, handing the bags down.
Sometimes they were not babies at all. Bryan Bush, 19, came out of an apartment in sweats and a hoodie. He had been working at Six Flags Over Georgia, the amusement park.
Not anymore, he said. He grabbed a sack of breakfast and a sack of lunch.— Richard Fausset
11:40 a.m.BostonThalia Bardell crouched in front of the laptop she had propped up on a chair, centering it in the roughly three-foot-wide wedge of space between the end of her unmade bed and a dresser.
“Hi, B!” she called out to the screen. “How’s the dogs?”“They’re trouble,” the screen replied.Ms. Bardell teaches barre exercises, which are modeled loosely after ballet, to mostly women in their 20s, 30s and 40s. When Boston shut down, her clients begged her to come up with a way to give their minds and bodies a break from idle worry about the pandemic.
Live-streamed exercise instruction was having a moment before the crisis, as home fitness companies like Peloton paired their machines with remote-access instructors. Now teaching remotely is one of the few options instructors have left.
She called the group to attention. “All right guys, let’s go!” Nurses, bartenders, teachers and financial analysts appeared on the screen, following her through a routine of squats and lunges as she snapped her fingers with the precision of a metronome.
“Kerry, that’s a beautiful pace!” she said.“Maite, lower your hips an inch.”Ms. Bardell believes in moving quickly so no one has time to dwell on the pain. “You’re in a physically uncomfortable situation right now in your body, and you’re in an emotionally uncomfortable situation in the world,” she said. “And it’s like, we’re going to get through this together, just like we do with every single class.”— Caitlin Dickerson

12:30 p.m.Amherst, Mass.Ariana Lee, a Chinese student stranded on the campus of Amherst College, walked into a dining hall past a pandemic-era warning sign: “Admittance Restricted.”
The food service workers lit up when they saw her. She greeted them brightly. “Hi! Can I get the pulled chicken taco over Mexican rice? And some guac with the salsa, please?”
These days, with classes now online, campus feels like a ghost town. In her one-minute walk to the dining hall, Ms. Lee, a senior, encountered only one other person, a janitor pushing a cart full of cleaning supplies across the common room, like a lone ship leaning into a storm.
The servers wore gloves, but no masks. The open cereal dispensers stood empty. The cafeteria tables were cordoned off.
The food was tastier than it was before the pandemic, she said, but the portions were smaller. She preferred not to pick up food in town, though, because “people on the street say racist things.” The other day, a man called her Chinese-American friend a racial expletive and said that wearing a mask would not help.
Her parents have left Beijing and are riding out a two-week quarantine in a small apartment in Hong Kong. They have to wear trackers on their wrists. Food is delivered to their door. Her mother sprays down every package with disinfectant.
Ms. Lee walked back to her dorm room, unpacked her brown paper bag and laid out her food on her desk: two bananas, an orange, a cardboard bowl of rice, a cardboard box of chicken tacos. She looked at it, as if it were a still-life painting, and did not eat.— Anemona Hartocollis
2:04 pmPittsburghThe milk incident happened right after lunch, when the 8-year-old was losing patience with long division. It was his second tantrum of the day, the first set off by a missing sweatshirt. That one had been pretty loud, but at least it didn’t involve spilling milk all over the dining room table.
A home-schooling mother as of two weeks ago, Tanying Dong, 39, has been trying to make sure her oldest son does at least some schoolwork every day. When he is absorbed in a lesson and his little brothers, ages 2 and 5, are nestled in the soft glow of PBS Kids, Ms. Dong can then maybe get to some of the endless other tasks. Such as her paying job, in public law. And the housework. The meals. The checking-in on friends and relatives.
Three boys, at prime havoc age, with no school, no day care, no babysitter, no playgrounds, no friends and, for much of the time, no other adult.
Amid it all, she has taken up sewing. Specifically, face masks for the whole family. Ms. Dong’s husband is a pediatric anesthesiologist, and while the children’s hospital is not yet a battlefield infirmary like so many urban emergency rooms, things could change quickly.
The sewing had been going pretty well until the 5-year-old knocked the sewing machine on the floor. Her husband seems to have fixed it. She’ll know tonight when she picks it back up, once the kids are in bed.— Campbell Robertson
2:49 p.m.Norman, Okla.Police Officer Chris Allison pulled over a red Chrysler 300 sedan, approached from the passenger side and asked the driver for his license and insurance. The man pulled the papers from his glove compartment and leaned toward the window. But Officer Allison didn’t touch them.
He reached instead for his cellphone.“OK, I’m just going to take a picture of that,” Officer Allison told the man.
Officer Allison, 34, patrols southwest Norman, where a stay-at-home order is in effect and four nursing home residents have died from the pandemic. Norman is different now, and so is policing. The most prosaic parts of the job have become potential hazmat situations.
Officers used to sit two to a table for pre-shift briefings at headquarters, but social distancing put an end to roll call. Officers also keep their distance from one another when they go out on calls. On Tuesday, the officer’s lunch got a wipe-down: He used Clorox wipes to disinfect his milkshake, tea and wrapped straws.
At the end of his shift, he used to park his police S.U.V. outside his house, walk inside and hug his wife, 5-year-old daughter and 1-year-old son. Now, he pulls straight into the garage, undresses there, stuffs his uniform into the washing machine, disinfects his equipment and then heads straight for the shower before touching anyone.
It turned out that the Chrysler’s license plate didn’t match the vehicle. Maybe it was stolen. Maybe the driver hadn’t registered it yet. From the driver’s seat of the S.U.V., the officer asked for backup. Then he readied himself to face the driver again. He reached over to the passenger seat for his blue cloth mask.— Manny Fernandez
4:16 p.m.Orlando, Fla.Kimberley Mitchell, a second-generation funeral director, gathered the grieving family in her office. In the age of social distancing, her only goal was to help them hang on to the tiniest bit of cultural tradition.
Ms. Mitchell of Mitchell’s Funeral Home looked into the eyes of the family representative seated across the room. A month ago, she would have placed her hand on the relative’s shoulder as a gesture of comfort.
On this afternoon, she gently laid out the dizzying, surreal set of safety rules reshaping how America buries its dead. The family settled on a simple half-hour service in the chapel. It has 22 rows of pews — room for seven mourners, a pastor and two staff members. They also decided to hold a memorial service once the country returned to normal.
“It feels something like ‘to be continued’ for some people saying goodbye to their loved ones,” she said.
Before the crisis, Ms. Mitchell greeted family members reeling from loss with hugs. Now, it was simply too risky. Now mourners had to move through reposing rooms in shifts, one small group at a time.
It was jarring. And exhausting. And unmooring.But Ms. Mitchell still had her smile and her words. She could still offer hope and the promise of healing by reciting from the 30th chapter of Psalms — “joy cometh in the morning.”
“The hardest thing is to see someone grieving alone,” she said. “Think about that. Alone.”— Audra D.S. Burch
5:01 p.m.Pascagoula, Miss.Dr. Steven Demetropoulos had been seeing patients since 7:10 a.m. He was tired, but he was also a man on a mission.
He needed to drive home in his pickup truck so he could quickly change clothes before heading back out, straight to City Hall, where he hoped to convince the Council to enact a curfew.
In February, Dr. Demetropoulos became the mayor of Pascagoula, a Gulf Coast city of about 21,000 people. He ran on a platform of economic growth and beautification.
But now he also makes videos for residents about how to survive the worst public health crisis in decades. “This is Dr. Steve, your mayor,” he tells them, dressed in green scrubs behind the mayor’s desk.
Tomorrow he would make another video, about how droplets spread through the air and why it was important that people stay six feet apart.
His advice is not limited to physical health.“Keep trusting, keep praying,” he said in one video. “We will get through this together.”— Rick Rojas

7 p.m.Portsmouth, OhioKalee Kamer was in bed, snuggled next to her boyfriend and their cat, Dirtball, participating in a drug recovery meeting streaming on Facebook Live.
Ms. Kamer — 27 months sober after decades of addiction to heroin, meth, crack and whatever else she could get her hands on — lost her burger-joint waitressing job on March 15. She and her boyfriend, Chris Keeton, who is also in recovery, have cleaned the house so thoroughly it practically gleams. They watch four or five virtual recovery meetings a week.
In this small city, the center of Ohio’s opioid epidemic, temptation is never far.The couple’s gazes are fixed on the Facebook session, hosted by a local drug recovery group called Raw Addiction.
Kathy Newman, a drug treatment counselor nearly nine years in recovery, urged viewers like Ms. Kamer to stick with the program. Flurries of emojis rose across the screen as viewers cheered in support.
Hundreds of comments appeared in real time — testaments of hope and despair that would, in normal times, be shared face-to-face.
I’m afraid of picking up the needle again … I need out.I’m in rehab.April 6th will be 18 months clean from shooting up. You guys are such a great inspiration.
Ms. Kamer, 32, wrote one: Did 2 years in prison. Haven’t seen my son in 3.5 years, been clean 27 months. He is a huge motivation on why I’m still clean! #goals
It was one voice in an ocean.I got 31 days.First time watcher.I am so close to breaking.— Dan Levin
9 p.m.Los AngelesThe schedule promised a matchup between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Colorado Rockies. But Dodger Stadium is empty, its doors locked shut, and outside, the birds are louder than what is left of traffic in one of America’s most congested cities.
All the familiar faces are somewhere else. The guys hawking T-shirts, the guys selling beers out of coolers, the guys scalping tickets, the women cooking bacon-wrapped hot dogs just before the final uphill into the stadium parking lots, blocked off with signs that now say “No public access.”
Solitary joggers passed by, one after another, under billboards advertising season tickets for a season in limbo. A man in a surgical mask walked his pug.
Alex Wood, the 29-year-old left-hander, was scheduled to pitch for the Dodgers. Right about now, the Rockies would be finishing batting practice, and Mr. Wood would be in the clubhouse going over the game plan with his catcher and pitching coach. Instead, he’s a few hundred miles away in Arizona, crashing at a teammate’s house. He said he was throwing most days, and just trying to maintain “some semblance of sanity.”
During what would have been game time, he said, he was doing pretty much what every other American was doing. Eating. Watching television. Sleeping.
Mr. Wood counseled patience for frustrated fans. “Let that excitement continue to build,” he said, “and let it loose once we start our season.”— Tim Arango
11 p.m.North Kansas City, Mo.Donna Danahy was sitting on a mattress in a hotel just off the interstate, queasy from the rising waves of dread and uncertainty.
Ms. Danahy, 58, lost her job as a server at Steak ’n Shake a couple of weeks back when it moved to drive-through only. With that, she lost the income needed to pay the first month’s rent — $600 — on what was supposed to be a new studio apartment.
A co-worker she had been staying with left town, leaving Ms. Danahy homeless. For several days she parked her 2006 Toyota Camry in a truck stop, drawing down curtains attached with Velcro, sliding a sun visor in the windshield and tucking her 5-foot-1-inch frame into the back seat for a nerve-racking attempt at sleep. Sometimes she closed her eyes and wished she would never wake up. Sometimes she was hard on herself for not securing a more stable existence.
“Leading up to this, I felt all this was self-induced; I did this to myself,” she said.The plan had been to move into the new place on April 1. But the landlord told Ms. Danahy she would release her unit if she could not come up with the money by April 14. She was hired for a $13-an-hour job at a grocery store deli but could not start until she got her birth certificate, which was on its way in the mail.
A social services organization secured her the hotel room for a week. But what would she do once the week was up? She began to cry. It was hard not to feel vulnerable. She has asthma. She wondered if she would get infected from all the moving around.— John Eligon
12:40 a.m.Kirkland, Wash.Tammy Wiatrowski curled up on a lilac sectional with a writing tray and a floral-patterned journal.She has been writing in it since early March, after working 57 hours over four days as a charge nurse in a critical care unit. It had dealt with the first spate of the nation’s deaths, a crunch of supplies, quarantined employees and a dire uncertainty.“As the weekend went on and more patients lost their battle with the virus, I realized both my daughters and all 5 of my grandkids could get this and might not survive.”She told her daughters that weekend that it might be months before they could spend time together. Her home has been quiet ever since. No slumber parties. The Nerf guns sit unused. The video game console is off. Ms. Wiatrowski has instead gone shopping, leaving groceries at her daughter’s doorstep and stepping back.“Only to be able to wave as she opened the door. Telling them ‘I love them!’ My grandson saying, ‘It’s OK, Granny, I can give you an invisible hug!’ as he stretched his arms out …”For the first time in 14 years, her job has distanced her from the ones she loves. It is the same for her patients.
Ms. Wiatrowski cannot bring families in to hold hands during the last breaths. She cannot wrap her arms around those who are in grief. She cannot help them get a talisman, like a lock of hair or an EKG strip.“I can’t even give them a piece of paper with their heartbeat without feeling like it’s contaminated. Now everything feels contaminated.”— Mike Baker
1 a.m.Berkeley, Calif.In the manner of academic scientists during normal times, at the end of a day that was light years from normal, Enrique Lin Shiao led with the data.
Never mind that the prestigious University of California, Berkeley, biology laboratory where he is a postdoctoral fellow was shuttered for regular research studies. Or that Dr. Lin Shiao, 31, was presenting his results to disembodied colleagues in a Slack channel as he ate dinner.
What mattered was that providing the data to the Food and Drug Administration was a prerequisite for clearance to perform much-needed clinical tests for the new coronavirus.
And the data was good.“Awesome work,” typed Jennifer Doudna, a Berkeley professor who runs the Innovative Genomics Institute, as she studied Dr. Lin Shiao’s graphs from her living room.
The dearth of tests available to Americans who may be infected has anguished molecular biologists, whose research routinely invokes the basic procedure used to detect virus genes in a patient’s nasal swab.
Dr. Doudna, the co-developer of a gene-editing tool called CRISPR, has transformed the first floor of her institute into a testing center that aims to process at least 1,000 samples a day. But first, the group needed to show the F.D.A. the lowest level of virus its test could detect.
As some of Dr. Lin Shiao’s colleagues appended congratulatory “clapping” and “on fire” icons to the charts that indicated the test was highly sensitive, others looked ahead, to when they would begin again.— Amy Harmon
5 a.m.New YorkThe sky over Central Park was slate gray, with pinpoints of stars dim amid the city’s stubborn glow.
The East Meadow, its lush grass preserved by fences and “Keep Off” signs for an anticipated summer of sun tanning and picnics, was instead bathed in a sea of white medical tents brought by truck from North Carolina to aid the city’s overwhelmed hospitals.
The tents — 14 in all — were empty, save for 68 portable metal beds, neatly laid with identical white sheets and pillows.
Samaritan’s Purse, a Christian charity, drove in its own supplies. Once the field hospital gets final administrative approval from health department officials to operate, the city will supply the patients.
In the I.C.U. tent, there were 10 beds, each accompanied by the most desired piece of medical equipment in the world — a ventilator, which can cost upward of $50,000.
Samaritan’s Purse has used the same field hospital to treat families stricken by Ebola in Liberia, to care for townspeople who had been trapped in rubble after an earthquake in Ecuador, and to operate on children in Iraq who had been struck by shrapnel launched by the Islamic State.
A few weeks ago, it set up a similar field hospital in Cremona, Italy, the nation with the world’s most coronavirus fatalities. This is the first time one of the hospitals has been deployed in the United States. No one knows how long a field hospital will be needed in the center of Manhattan.— Timothy Williams
6 a.m.Newton, N.C.The sky was still dark when the Rev. Rob Lee sat down at his desk, picked up his fountain pen and began to write.
Even in normal times, Mr. Lee, 27, is an early riser. But in the weeks since a pandemic put an end to all routines, including Sunday church, he has been waking up earlier and earlier, no need for an alarm.
He thinks about his congregation of about 50 regulars and the “collective pain” shared across the world right now. He thinks about his wife, who lost hours at her marketing job. He thinks about his mother, a hospice nurse. And, if he is being honest, he thinks about himself, his own mortality. A year and a half ago, a lung collapsed during an asthma attack, leaving him especially vulnerable to the outbreak.
A few weeks ago, as the crisis intensified, he issued an online callout for prayer requests and offered to send handwritten letters in return. So far, he has received more than 300:I am alone in California and far from family.I just lost my job today.I feel lonely and unsettled in these times.
Mr. Lee, a descendant of General Robert E. Lee who once made headlines for speaking out against white supremacy and Confederate monuments, sees the current crisis as another pivotal moment for the country.
Writing back to the supplicants has become both a grounding ritual to calm his own anxieties — and a small act of resistance.
“It’s a sense of, we’re going to show up,” he said. “The coronavirus is terrible, but it’s not the fullness of who we are as a people. It’s not the end of our story.”— Sarah Mervosh",real

John Robert “Johnny” Boone vouched for his release on the grounds that he is 76, in poor health and has served most of his 57-month prison sentence, The Courier Journal reported Thursday. Elmer George, his lawyer, added Boone has a history of illnesses and called his continued imprisonment life-threatening.

About 137 inmates and eight prison employees have tested positive for the novel coronavirus at the Federal Correctional Institution at Elkton, where Boone is serving out his prison sentence. Another 63 inmates and 44 prison employees have recovered after testing positive for the virus, the Courier Journal reported.

The U.S. Bureau of Prisons has so far released only five of the 837 Elkton inmates identified as medically vulnerable to home confinement, a move that drew rebuke from a federal judge in Cleveland this week. The American Civil Liberties Union has also sued the Bureau of Prisons over the issue.

Boone, who had called himself “Charles Grass,” fled to Canada after a 2008 indictment on federal drug charges in Kentucky and spent eight years on the loose until his capture in late 2016. He was sentenced in 2018 after pleading guilty to one count of conspiring to possess, grow and distribute more than 1,000 marijuana plants at an operation near Springfield, Kentucky.

Boone was convicted in the 1980s and spent a decade in prison for what prosecutors called a massive marijuana syndicate. They said he was head of a multistate marijuana operation known as the “Cornbread Mafia,” which had 29 farms in several states.

He was featured on the TV show “America’s Most Wanted,” spurring a Facebook page called Run, Johnny, Run.

On top of that, Trump complained, that figure also includes asymptomatic cases rather than just the most debilitating ones. More than 91,000 Americans have died from the virus.

“When we have a lot of cases, I don’t look at that as a bad thing,” the president said. “I look at that in a certain respect as being a good thing, because it means our testing is much better. So, if we were testing a million people instead of 14 million people, it would have far few cases, right?”

“So, I view it as a badge of honor. Really, it’s a badge of honor,” he concluded. “It’s a great tribute to the testing and all of the work that a lot of professionals have done.”

The Trump administration has repeatedly sought to spin its early failures on access to coronavirus testing throughout the country. Testing has ramped up immensely over the past month as public-health experts emphasized the importance of a robust testing operation to any eventual reopening of the country, and last week the White House held an event in the Rose Garden to boast that America now “leads the world in testing.”",real
1474,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-safrica-malaicha/zimbabweans-in-south-africa-use-app-to-send-food-home-after-border-restrictions-idUSKBN22V1JH?il=0,2020-05-19,Zimbabweans in South Africa use app to send food home after border restrictions,"JOHANNESBURG/HARARE (Reuters) - Petronella Mabhena, a domestic worker in South Africa, has been paying bus drivers to ferry food to her relatives in Zimbabwe for over a decade.

As with many other families from Zimbabwe whose members depend on food from South Africa, the supplies were abruptly halted when the two countries restricted movement across their border in March to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

“I was confused and did not know what to do,” said Mabhena, 53, who sends food to her mother and daughter.

A friend told her about an app that lets people in South Africa order groceries for delivery in Zimbabwe, where prices for food and other essentials have soared amid a severe economic crisis.

Use of the app called Malaicha - Ndebele slang for the traditional way of sending goods over the border with bus and taxi drivers - surged in April, said its managing director, Sayjil Magan.

While the border has been closed to people and the taxis and buses that would normally ferry food informally, Malaicha is permitted to import goods into Zimbabwe, offering an alternative.

About a year old, the app has yet to break even, in part because its costs, including trucks and warehousing, are higher than the typical digital startup.

But if its user base continues to grow, it could emerge as a rare winner from South Africa’s lockdown, one of the world’s most restrictive.

Previously, Malaicha handled an average of 20,000 to 30,000 orders a month, Magan said, but that number increased by around 200% month-on-month in April, while user numbers grew by around 100% to 75,000.

“It’s something they are going to carry on using; that’s the feedback that we are getting from our customers,” Magan said.

In Zimbabwe’s capital Harare, one of five major cities where Malaicha operates, deliveries reached 200 a day in April, from an average of 20 before the lockdown, said warehouse manager Mario Ventouris.

Workers were putting in extra hours to clear long lines of people who had come to collect orders, he added.

Delivery driver Decide Sabamba said his job was tougher than before: “It’s busy, it’s busy every day.”

He brought cooking oil and diapers to Mabhena’s daughter, Epiphania Moyo, and her baby - their first delivery via the app.

The family is all too familiar with the frustration of traditional malaicha deliveries, which they said cost more and don’t always arrive on time or in full. Their experience with the app was different.

“They are very fast; they delivered everything. I will use it again,” Moyo added.",real
1139,https://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2020/05/andrew_cuomo_in_all_his_ugliness.html,2020-05-16,Andrew Cuomo in All His Ugliness,"Much of the nation these past few months has focused on New York state since it became the hotspot for the coronavirus outbreak in the U.S. Many have also complimented Governor Andrew Cuomo’s response in fighting the pandemic, even to the point of suggesting he should substitute for presidential hopeful Joe Biden as the Democratic Party nominee to face Donald Trump in the November election.

On Tuesday, Cuomo proposed a new law that aims to prevent corporations from receiving stimulus funds as a result of COVID-19. While he presents himself as a governor who will tackle all forms of injustice, especially in light of his continual hands-on approach during this crisis, Cuomo is anything but the knight in shining armor he is being portrayed as.

Disregard for the Disabled and Elderly

Cuomo ordered nursing homes for the elderly and infirm to accept patients with COVID-19. As reported by Pamela Geller:

“Weeks before [Cuomo] prohibited these homes from turning someone away for having COVID, there were numerous reports that nursing homes, assisted living and congregate care centers were the most vulnerable to Coronavirus. [This was because] the biggest drag on New York state is Medicaid — what better way to rid the state of the old, sick, and disabled?”

Syracuse University Professor Scott Landes explained that because the home population “in general, [have] swallowing problems or disorders, or choking disorders, or just more susceptibility to lung infections [and] seem to develop pneumonia at a higher rate than those in the general population.” He added that COVID-19 is even more challenging for those living in congregate residential settings.

Towards the end of April, the CEO of a hard-hit Brooklyn nursing home, where 55 patients had died from the coronavirus, warned New York Health Department officials for weeks that he had staffing and equipment issues — yet he received little help.

In what was a self-contradiction, Cuomo — who himself has described nursing homes as a “feeding frenzy’’for the deadly coronavirus — said that the facilities cannot challenge his regulation forcing the homes to admit patients with the contagion. And although he argued that they can transfer patients who have tested positive for the coronavirus to a different facility, this too has been misleading. On a personal note, the godmother of one of my sisters, who is nearly ninety years old, was forced to stay at a nursing home despite being infected with the COVID-19 — she miraculously recovered despite not having had the required medical attention at the home that she should have received.

Manipulating Facts and Shunning Responsibility

In March, Cuomo began to gripe against President Trump, demanding up to 40,000 ventilators to tackle the coronavirus. Media outlets, such as The Washington Post sided with Cuomo, stating: “Trump questions New York’s plea for critical equipment” — yet this came after the president said: “I don't believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators.” As it turned out, New York, according to updated models from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, had already reached its peak projected ventilator usage on April 8, with a projected need of 5,008. The actual use may have been lower.

In any case, as I had previously written, had the New York governor needed so many ventilators, in 2015, after learning that the state’s stockpile of medical equipment had 16,000 fewer ventilators than New Yorkers would need in a severe pandemic, Cuomo chose not to buy more of them. Instead, he asked his health commissioner Howard Zucker to assemble a task force and draft rules for rationing the ventilators they already had.

Cuomo also recognized, but failed to do anything about, a shortage of masks and other protective gear. On March 6, as reported by CNBC, weeks before Trump raised the issue, Cuomo stated that people were stealing the equipment out of hospitals in New York. “Not just people taking a couple or three, I mean just actual thefts of those products. I’ve asked the state police to do an investigation, look at places that are selling masks, medical equipment, protective wear.” There is, however, no evidence that he or the police ever followed up, directly resulting in a shortage today.

As reported by New York City freelance reporter Danielle Tcholakian, Cuomo, on Feb. 4, announced his “Medicaid redesign team,” the latest a long line of cumbersome task forces he likes to convene and then hamstring (see, for example, the Moreland Commission, and the task force created to get HIV below epidemic levels, and whose report he delayed and whose funding recommendations he reneged on).

While one would think amidst the pandemic any elected official would seek more funding for health care, Cuomo pursued a $2.5 billion cut in Medicaid to New York’s hospitals alongside limiting their expansion to save more money. This is not to deny the problems of federal funding, however, Cuomo had avoided for years tackling substantively the problem of Medicaid in ways that were not opportunistic, such as conceding large sums of money to entities connected to political donors. He could have spent the necessary $576 million at disposal on the ventilators to prepare for the worst-case scenario, but instead he opted to spend $750 million on on a boondoggle “Buffalo Billion” solar panel factory.

Abortion

In 2019, Cuomo, on the day before the anniversary of the Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade, signed into law the Reproductive Health Act (RHA), which legislates a woman’s ability to have an abortion up to 24 weeks of pregnancy — when abortion is never medically necessary and when children born prematurely are routinely able to survive outside the womb with careful tending. It also permits non-doctors to perform abortions up to the moment of birth. He marked the moment with public celebrations, which given the context, appeared ghoulish.

Prior to signing the RHA, Cuomo’s dedication to “reproductive rights” allowed for the extermination of more than 82,000 unborn lives in his state in 2016 alone — approximately 2,000 of those unborn children were killed after 20 weeks of pregnancy, the threshold where advanced neonatal intensive care is just beginning to enable survival; nearly 6,000 of those unborn children were killed in dilation and evacuation abortions.

Cuomo, a professed Catholic, stated on Fox News: “The Catholic Church doesn’t believe in a woman’s right to choose. Yes, I understand their religious view. But I’m not here to legislate religion” — equally to blame is the Cardinal Archbishop of New York Timothy Dolan for giving Cuomo a get out of jail card on the matter.

This was nothing more than a doubling-down by Cuomo since religion has nothing to do with that has been proven by science - that human life is human life. The legislation, as President Trump said during his State of the Union address last year, “allow[s] a baby to be ripped from a mother’s womb” — while Cuomo’s law classifies a “person” as a “human being who has been born and is alive” – meaning unborn babies are not “persons.”

Trump has gone so far as to define life beginning at the moment of conception.

Cuomo has made it clear that he has no plans, if the situation were to present itself, to take Sleepy Joe’s place as the Democrat candidate for president this year. That does not mean he does not aspire to the White House — Tcholakian revealed that already there have been $280 “Cuomo for President” cashmere sweaters are flying off the shelves. Whether it is this year or in 2024 when Andrew Cuomo potentially presents himself as a presidential candidate, he would do so based on a myth that he was the knight in shining armor, when in fact he has been just the opposite.

Here's your room-by-room look at the future,"Hotels are cautiously reopening for the summer travel season, but it's anything but business as usual in the hospitality industry. Last week, the American Hotel & Lodging Association (AHLA) introduced its Safe Stay guidelines developed under the guidance of an advisory council that includes Accor, InterContinental Hotels Group, Marriot International, Omni Hotels & Resorts and Walt Disney. Now, the health and cleaning guidelines are being adopted by thousands of hotels, with many choosing to go beyond its recommendations.

Getting to your hotel

Arriving by air? There's a chance your hotel has started cleaning the area around you before you're even left the airport. Sandals Resorts identified 18 key touch points — or points of high contact — for extra cleaning, starting with airport lounges and vehicle transfers. Many hotels are increasing the frequency of airport transfers to reduce the number of passengers in each vehicle too.

If you're arriving via your own car, don't assume a valet team will be waiting out front, as many hotels like the Hotel Crescent Court in Dallas, Texas are suspending the service. Other hotels are keeping it and disinfecting the vehicle between drivers. Bell hops — where are the bell hops? Be prepared to carry your own bags. Camelback Resort in Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains has suspended its bell service, though guests can use bell carts which have been sanitized after every use. Its hotel employees aren't opening car or taxi doors upon arrival either.

Stepping into the lobby

Don't be alarmed if you're stopped at the hotel's front door for a wellness screening and temperature check. This is what Camelback is doing. The resort — which is scheduled to reopen on June 11 — is also asking guests to use hand sanitizer, wear a mask and comply with six-foot social distancing policies. Next, you reach for the front door, and — there's no handle? It's been removed to eliminate a major touch point. How about a welcome drink? No dice. Instead, you'll be provided with branded PPE (personal protective equipment) upon arrival. Inside the lobby, you will likely find your favorite hotel looks different. Aesthetics are taking a backseat to safety with social distancing signage displayed throughout hotels, hand sanitizing stations placed every 50 to 100 feet and furniture removed to discourage congregating. Floors may be marked to encourage one-way pedestrian flow between entrances and exits.

Checking into your room

To check in, there is a good chance you'll avoid the front desk entirely. Hotels, such as the The Wayfinder Hotel in Newport, Rhode Island, are offering curbside check-in while major hotel chains are transitioning to ""digital keys"" which allow you to check in and out (and pay your bill) via your mobile phone. This eliminates the need for magnetic key cards (which must be sanitized after every use), queuing with other guests and interacting with the front desk staff. Hilton has introduced contactless check-in and check-outs at more than 4,700 hotels around the globe, including its Waldorf Astoria and Conrad Hotels & Resorts. The new technology will require enhanced communication with guests, many of whom are accustomed to heading straight to the front desk, which is exactly what hotels want to avoid.

Mobile phone check-ins mean guests will spend less time in communal areas, like those of the Waldorf Astoria Jerusalem (shown here). © 2020 Hilton

Front desk staff will still be present — likely standing behind a plexiglass partition — and sporting new accoutrements to their impeccably polished attire: masks and gloves. Chip and pin readers will be used to avoid the need to pass credit cards for payment, an act the AHLA recommends should result in an employee washing their hands ""for at least 20 seconds."" The front desk, even if not used much, will be cleaned at multiple points throughout the day, as will elevator buttons, public bathrooms, vending machines, ATMs, handrails and seating areas.

Walking through the hotel

Staff may no longer escort you to — or show you around — your room, and elevators are being limited to just the people in your party. The latter may not be as hard as it sounds, as more hotels are instituting maximum guest occupancy rates, such as the Relais & Chateaux hotel Eden Roc Cap Cana in the Dominican Republic which will operate at a maximum of 30% capacity, while European luxury hotel brand Rocco Forte Hotels is limiting the number of guests per floor.

On the way to the room, you'll likely pass more cleaning staff than in the past — for good reason. ""Hotels will have more visual cleaning staff and sanitizing stations. Housekeepers will move from behind the scene to front and center in hotels,"" said Tony Kim, assistant professor at Hart School of Hospitality, Sport and Recreation management at James Madison University, noting the mere presence of cleaning staff will make guests feel safer.

Inside your hotel room

Changes to your room may be apparent before you even enter. Hilton is applying a seal on guestroom doors to indicate they haven't been accessed since they were last cleaned. The room itself may look strangely bare. Why? Items that are difficult to disinfect are missing, including decorative pillows, bed scarves, notepads, pamphlets and pens. Minibars — they're gone too, though they may be replaced in another way, such as the pop-up bodegas being installed at the front desk of Kimpton luxury boutique hotels. Other items, such as robes, will be available upon request. On the upside, a welcome drink and cool hand towel may be waiting for you in your room, as Sandals Resorts are doing. Many hotels are giving guests in-room personal safety kits stocked with masks, disinfectant and wipes.

Guests at luxury, all-inclusive AMResorts in the Caribbean and Central and South America will find pillows, blankets and in-room tablets sealed in vacuum packaging. Remington Hotels — a Dallas-based hospitality group that manages select Sheraton, Westin and Marriott hotels among others — is testing Germ Guard, a single-use preventative sleeve that slides over remote control devices. Daily newspaper deliveries are going digital with electronic PressReader access that customers can read on their personal devices. Similarly, face-to-face concierge services are moving to text messaging through software such as Kipsu and Whistle. None of this — not one part — will come easy for hotels. ""Hotels have always focused on personalized service and providing a warm, welcoming environment for its guests,"" said Kate Walsh, the dean of the School of Hotel Administration at Cornell University. ""The challenge for hotels will be to convey the essence of hospitality when we socially distance and disconnect guests from the staff.""

Housekeeping matters

Perhaps one of the biggest changes will be to housekeeping services. Room cleanings will be more intense but conducted less often, at least for guests staying multiple nights. Unless specifically requested, most cleanings will be done after guests leave. Some hotels, such as Best Western, are waiting 24 to 72 hours to enter a room after guests have left. Room cleanings are now concentrating on high-touch points, such as door and furniture handles, faucets, light switches, remote controls, thermostats, clocks and hangers. Used towels may be placed outside the door for pickup and replaced with a sealed bag of fresh ones, again found outside the door. Major brands such as Hilton and Marriott are turning to electrostatic sprayers and ultraviolet light technology. Sandals Resorts are sanitizing air ducts upon each departure and steam-cleaning room carpets every week.

The Westin Houston Medical Center was the first hotel to deploy robots to disinfect guest rooms and communal areas. Made by San Antonio-based Xenex Disinfection Services, the germ-zapping robots are designed to kill bacteria, fungi and viruses using UV light. They have been shown to destroy coronavirus, the company says.

Restaurants and room service

Amani Roberts, co-director of Cal State Fullerton's Center for Entertainment and Hospitality Management, believes hotel food and beverage outlets and banquet facilities will be affected more than any other area. ""I personally think buffets will no longer be in existence, which will increase food costs for hotels,"" he said. The AHLA recommends limiting buffets, but if offered, serving them via a masked attendant. Remington Hotels are moving away from buffets to open seating arrangements in outdoor areas. ""Many restaurants in a hotel will either remain closed or limit the capacity. If remaining closed, hotels will offer room delivery service — some via a robot-delivery system — or quick grab-and-go service,"" said Kim. ""If hotels decided to open, they will limit the capacity by removing some tables and chairs and installing partitions for communal tables.""

Hotel restaurants are moving to paper and digital menus, the latter located on walls or via customer's mobile phone, with a renewed reliance on single-use plastic and paper products. Bar stools are being removed to provide space between customers. Payment will happen table-side at sanitized mobile credit card terminals, like that at the InterContinental Los Angeles Downtown. Other hotels are getting creative. Room service menus are being expanded, delivery is moving to ""knock and drop"" at guest doors and ordering is done via customers' mobile phones, such as that offered at over 3,200 Marriott hotels. The Palms Turks & Caicos is introducing family-style in-room dining menus, and the historic Washington School House Hotel in Park City, Utah, has started a new ""Anyplace Dining"" option where guests can eat in quiet parts of the hotel, by the pool and in the private garden.

Communal spaces and entertainment

Many sports and recreational areas are closed or operating at limited capacities with enhanced cleanings. Some hotels are limiting pools to half the normal number of people allowed. ""Similar to guests making a massage appointment, hotels may now require advance-timed reservations for using the tennis court, pool, spa and other amenities,"" said Rob Karp, CEO of luxury travel agency MilesAhead.

That's what Maine's Kennebunkport Resort Collection decided to do when it made the gym accessible by reservation only. It's cleaning the gym before and after each guest and introducing in-room fitness options. Other hotels are allowing guests to use bikes, beach chairs and umbrellas but are cleaning them after every use.

The tool is part of the company’s work with a group called the CoVig-19 Plasma Alliance.

When someone is infected with a virus, their immune system produces antibodies to fight it. Once the infected person recovers, they have these antibodies in their blood.

“The sooner recovered COVID-19 patients donate convalescent plasma, the sooner the Alliance may be able to start manufacturing a potential therapy and begin clinical trials,” according to the post. “These trials will determine if this therapy could treat patients who are at risk for serious complications from COVID-19.”

Plasma infusions have helped some COVID-19 patients’ recovery time, early research has found

Giving the antibody-infused blood plasma of a recovered person to a newly infected person who may not have antibodies yet might help the sick person recover faster. This isn’t a new treatment; it was used to treat diphtheria in the 1890s and used — effectively — during the 1918 flu pandemic. Plasma infusions also have been used to treat people with diseases like SARS, measles, and chickenpox.

With COVID-19, some early information suggests plasma infusions have helped some patients’ recovery time, but it’s still too early to tell how effective the treatment is. Researchers in the US continue to run controlled studies on plasma infusion treatments for COVID-19 patients.

The Plasma Alliance’s goal is different from some other plasma-related initiatives; rather than focusing on giving plasma transfusions directly to infected patients, the alliance wants to make a therapy called a polyclonal hyperimmune globulin (H-Ig).

The process pools together multiple donations of plasma. Then, the antibodies are concentrated into a liquid form, which the researchers will try to use to create a medication that can treat the virus. The therapy would have to go through clinical trials before being approved to treat COVID-19 patients.

If they’re eligible, users will get information about where to donate their plasma, which takes about an hour, according to the alliance. They’ll begin recruiting in the US with plans to expand to Europe.

Economists agree that the US is already in a recession. Now, they're weighing what shape a potential recovery might take.

Many reports this week hit fresh records. But some showed glimmers of hope that a recovery may be coming as some states begin to reopen.

Here are seven economic signals that flashed warnings this week.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

In just two short months, the US economy has been devastated by the coronavirus pandemic and sweeping shut downs to contain the spread of the disease.

Last week's April jobs report showed that the US economy lost a record 20.5 million jobs and the unemployment rate spiked to 14.7%, the highest since the depths of the Great Depression. Since the eye-watering report, more have been released showing further damage to the US economy.

Economists and industry watchers agree that the US has been thrown into a recession from the coronavirus pandemic shutdowns. Now, all eyes are watching US economic data to gauge the extent of the damage and weigh what shape a recovery might take.

Initially, some argued that a swift, V-shaped recovery was possible. But as coronavirus-induced layoffs persist, and many consumers are still stuck at home, it now appears that any rebound will be more muted.

There have also been a few glimmers of hope as many states across the country slowly reopen. For example, even though April's jobs report showed devastating losses, 18.1 million workers were classified as temporarily unemployed, suggesting that they may be able to quickly re-enter the workforce when lockdowns are lifted.

In addition, some reports this week — while dismal — may represent a low point before a rebound. For example, April retail sales posted a second record slump, but may not record a third.

""This report was always going to be terrible,"" said Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics in a Friday note. ""But it likely marks the floor, given the gradual reopening now underway or soon to be underway.""

A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump’s measures of success. But after a manic 3½ years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.

By far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. “I’m not going to play that game,” said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. “I think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they’re not uniform across states and across countries.”

But even beyond the death count, there’s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. “I’m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,” the official said.

Some Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn’t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn’t been able to focus on getting the response right.

Trump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. “So it is a war and I define victory when it’s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,” he said on May 1. “It can never be a total victory because too many people have died.”

When American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn’t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush’s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.

Others are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. “Allowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,” argued one Republican close to the president.

“The closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.” Sen. Lindsey Graham

But, he added, “If things don’t look like they’re bouncing back by September, I think that’s going to be a problem.”

The fear that Trump can’t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.

When asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump’s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the “economic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.”

A spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.

Others are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)",real

It's been nearly 12 weeks since the first case of the novel coronavirus was confirmed in Washington state, and it's unclear when the wave of infections may subside.

One of the biggest questions for officials who are managing the government response is whether the country has reached the peak. In this Special Report, NPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro wraps up the week's best reporting on all of these angles and more. Click ""Listen"" at the top of the page.

The Trump administration is looking at a variety of scientific modeling to try to figure that out. Projections of the death toll vary by the tens of thousands.

""We're nearing the peak of the outbreak,"" Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield told NPR this week. He added that he expects ""to see the curve begin to go down.""

But some governors say their states are still struggling to get needed supplies. And critics like retired Army Lt. Gen. Russel Honore, who helped coordinate military relief in response to Hurricane Katrina, say the federal government can still be more aggressive in centralizing the distribution of resources.

Meantime, as Americans settle into wearing masks in public to avoid transmitting the coronavirus, they also need to look after their emotional well-being. A Kaiser Family Foundation Health tracking poll found that an increasing share of Americans — about half now, up from a third — say their mental health has been affected by the coronavirus crisis.",real

In the past, the $100,000 check from Mr. Trump has been made out to the Small Business Administration initiative to help veteran entrepreneurs, to the Office of the Surgeon General to fight the opioid epidemic, and to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, among other places.

But on Friday, Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, did not just reveal that the president was sending his salary to the Department of Health and Human Services to help “support the efforts being undertaken to confront, contain and combat the coronavirus.”

She also displayed the president’s private bank account and routing numbers.

The $100,000 check she held up like a prop appeared to be a real check from Capital One, complete with the relevant details. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but an administration official said mock checks were never used in the briefing.

For an average civilian, that information could be used to withdraw or deposit money, make online purchases or hack an account.

“It’s not a best practice to share that information publicly,” said Eva Velasquez, the president and chief executive of the Identity Theft Resource Center. “If you don’t have protections in place, there are sophisticated schemes and ways someone could access those funds knowing the account and routing number and the individual person it belongs to.”

Ms. Velasquez said that a bank was almost certain to have additional protections in place on the account of a high-profile person like the president. Mr. Trump, she said, was not likely to be hacked because of photographs that subsequently circulated online Friday night suggesting it appeared to be a real check.

But she said the image of Ms. McEnany flashing Mr. Trump’s personal information in front of cameras sent a concerning message. “This is one of those situations where setting the example is very important,” Ms. Velasquez said. “It’s very important for your average person to understand this is not a best practice.

Mike Chapple, a teaching professor of information technology at the University of Notre Dame, said the appearance showed why large promotional checks were used for television appearances. “They’re not only a nice prop onstage, but they also omit the sensitive account information that normally appears at the bottom of the check,” he said. “The rest of us should play it safe and keep our account numbers to ourselves.”

President Trump has drawn repeated comparisons between the novel coronavirus outbreak and the flu season.

""We have a lot of people dying from the flu on top of everything else,"" he said Monday. ""It's very bad. It looks like it could be over 50,000.""

The reality so far for the current flu season is still emerging. There have been at least 23,000 deaths from flu during the 2019-2020 season, according to estimates by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The upper range of the estimate for deaths is 59,000.

The CDC estimates there have been at least 38 million flu illnesses and 390,000 hospitalizations.

The CDC estimates are based on weekly surveillance data and are preliminary.

The rates of hospitalization for flu ""remain moderate"" overall, according to the CDC. But some age groups have experienced higher hospitalization rates than usual. Flu hospitalizations are ""the highest CDC has on record"" for young children, up to age 4, and adults ages, 18-49.

While the flu can send hundreds of thousands of people to the hospital each year, the seasonal effect is reasonably well understood and planned for. The comparison between flu and COVID-19 doesn't capture the strain that the new coronavirus is putting on hospitals.

COVID-19 is a new disease that is hard to predict. And the surge in cases requiring intensive care that was seen in China and now in Italy can lead to a health system's collapse, health officials have said.",real

Tyler O'Neil on 'Making Hate Pay: The Corruption of the Southern Poverty Law Center.'

Big Tech, Corporate America, Democrats, and left-leaning media outlets consider the Southern Poverty Law Center to be a reliable arbiter of “hate.” They have blacklisted organizations the SPLC brands “hate groups,” cutting them off from social media platforms, event spaces, online tools, and even credit cards.

But the SPLC is far from credible. In March 2019, the group was wracked by a racial discrimination and sexual harassment scandal that saw its leadership fired or forced to resign. Former employees came forward exposing the “con,” showing how the SPLC exaggerates “hate” to bilk donors and attack its political opponents. This discredited group is not to be trusted, but many powerful people continue to use its “hate group” accusation to silence conservatives and exile them from polite society.

638,https://www.businessinsider.com/andrew-cuomo-bill-gates-reimagine-new-york-schools-coronavirus-2020-5,2020-05-06,Andrew Cuomo just tapped Bill Gates to help him 'reimagine' what New York's public schools will look like when they reopen in the fall,"New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo plans to ""reimagine"" New York's public schools when they reopen in the fall, and Bill Gates is going to help him do it.

New York's public school system, the largest in the country, has been closed since March 16 and will remain closed through the rest of the school year as the city battles the worst outbreak of the novel coronavirus in the country. Though Cuomo did not provide many details on his plans for the school system or the collaboration with the Gates Foundation, the governor did allude that major changes to New York's classrooms may be on the way.

""The old model of everybody goes and sits in a classroom and the teacher is in front of that classroom, and teaches that class, and you do that all across the city, all across the state, all these buildings, all these physical classrooms — why with all the technology you have?"" Cuomo said during his daily press briefing on the pandemic Tuesday.

The Gates Foundation told Business Insider in a statement the organization had ""committed to work with New York State on its efforts to ensure equitable access to education for its students in response to the COVID-19 pandemic,"" and will soon provide more details about the partnership.

The collaboration with Cuomo won't be the first time the Gates Foundation has experimented with education. The billionaire-led organization spent $1 billion and seven years working on an initiative to improve test performance for students in low-income schools by closely monitoring teacher effectiveness. A report by independent think-tank RAND reviewing all the Gateses' education efforts in the US found in 2018 that the program ultimately didn't improve test scores or drop-out rates in the long-term, Business Insider reported at the time. In some cases, the program even ""did more harm than good,"" Jay Greene, a professor of education at the University of Arkansas, wrote on Education Next.

Cuomo also outlined other forthcoming changes to the state, including closing the city's previously 24/7 subway system nightly for cleanings and initiatives to make its healthcare system more resilient.",real
400,https://blog.heartland.org/2020/04/do-black-and-hispanic-lives-really-matter-to-progressives/,2020-04-22,Do Black and Hispanic Lives Really Matter to Progressives?,"A stunning report that came out in January of this year received little attention at first, and was then completely buried due to the avalanche of coronavirus-related stories. “The Secret Shame: How America’s Most Progressive Cities Betray Their Commitment to Educational Opportunity for All” compares the minority-white proficiency gap in progressive and conservative cities. And it’s no contest. America’s left-most cities are doing an awful job of educating Blacks and Hispanics.

The study, courtesy of brightbream, a “nonprofit network of education activists demanding a better education and a brighter future for every child,” maintains that progressive cities, on average, have achievement gaps in math and reading “that are 15 and 13 percentage points higher than in conservative cities, respectively. In San Francisco, for example, 70% of white students are proficient in math, compared to only 12% of black students reaching proficiency — a 58-point gap. In Washington, D.C., 83% of white students scored proficient in reading compared to 23 percent of black students — a 60-point gap. In contrast, three of the 12 most conservative cities — Virginia Beach, Anaheim and Fort Worth — have effectively closed or even erased the gap in at least one of the academic categories we examined.”

Importantly, the authors of the study controlled for factors that might bias the outcome: per-pupil spending, level of income equality, racial density et al, but they write that “controlling for these factors did not erase the correlation between a city’s progressivism and the sizable racialized gaps in educational outcomes.” Although the report shows a striking interrelationship between progressivism and failure, the researchers make no claims of causation.

There are many possible reasons for the disparity. Blogger James Bacon suggests that the left’s constant push for treating minorities as victims disempowers them. He also claims that the self-esteem crowd has done damage by lowering expectations for those considered victims of white racism.

Walter Williams, professor of economics at George Mason University, offers that crime could be a factor. Many well-meaning but destructive fads have become part of the scenario at progressive schools. “Restorative justice” and other similar non-consequences for willful defiance and worse have become the norm. As a result, discipline suffers and a few disruptors can make life miserable for behaving students and teachers alike.

I would add that teachers unions are certainly part of the problem. School boards tend to represent the political leanings of the school district’s voters. Hence, collective bargaining agreements in conservative cities like Anaheim tend to be more student-friendly than in progressive cities like San Francisco. These contracts are especially problematic in that they restrict school district efforts to use compensation as a tool to recruit, reward and retain the most effective teachers. Additionally, the ability to assign or remove teachers on the basis of fit or performance is greatly impeded.

While it’s true that all kids are negatively affected by collective bargaining, less advantaged kids don’t always have the support to compensate for it. Well-to-do parents can hire a tutor for their child if he has an under-performing teacher, for example.

Whatever the cause of the disparity, the question remains how to deal with it. The answer is simple, though politically difficult to achieve. While many public schools are burdened with collective bargaining agreements, restorative justice, promoting victimology and other pillars of progressivism, private schools are not. Hence the best thing we can do to level the playing field is to let parents choose the best school for their kid via vouchers, educational savings accounts, tax-credit scholarships, etc., and let tax dollars follow the student.

Of course, this is a bête noire for many finger-pointing progressives who nonsensically insist that privatizing education further lines the pockets of the wealthy. They also claim that choice is “racist.” But they are projecting. Until we move toward parental choice, racial disparities in progressive cities will continue unabated. Choice lifts all boats. Now if only we could get the progressives, along with the NAACP and the “Black Lives Matter” crowd to sign on, the U.S. would have a much more equitable education system.

If only.

1232,https://slate.com/human-interest/2020/05/coronavirus-restarting-business-child-care-travel-restaurants.html,2020-05-17,"6,000 people on what they’re comfortable doing in our new world: A Slate survey.","As the national conversation turns, perhaps prematurely, from flattening the curve to reopening businesses and restarting life, we’re all trying to figure out which parts of normal we’re comfortable resuming. Is it OK to bubble with another family this summer? Is it fine to go to the beach? Is it time to return to the office? When can we have child care again? As we enter this next phase of the coronavirus response, what’s reasonable and what’s not seem more and more determined not by government decree but by who you are, what your circumstances require, and sometimes just by how you feel.

Late last month, we asked readers what they think they’ll be comfortable doing when their city or state lifts stay-at-home orders. In other words: When you’re allowed to do these things, will you? More than 6,100 people responded to the survey, which included questions about getting back to office work and routine errands, child care, dining and entertainment, travel, and interpersonal habits we can’t believe we had to ask about, like hugging.

This survey was designed to identify how Slate readers feel and should not be taken as representative of the U.S. population. But the results did show noteworthy patterns among respondents. A hesitation to resume activities runs deep, though people who identified as Republicans were more willing to get back to normal than those who identified as Democrats, often by margins of 20 to 30 percentage points. Democrats were twice as likely as Republicans to answer a question with “I don’t know.”

Some activities, such as going to movie theaters, shaking hands, or hosting parties, remain a relic of the Before Times. Others, such as going to national parks and visiting the doctor for routine checkups, seem doable to many. Men were more likely than women to pick “yes”—as in, “yes, I will do this thing”—in almost every category. Young people age 18 to 24 were more likely to say yes to getting back to the things they used to do, sometimes by large margins, particularly activities that involve socializing.

Many respondents also wrote in to explain their answers to our questions and elaborate on their feelings. Quite a few parents, such as Dina in California, wrote about their need to get their kids back to day care or school: “It’s just not healthy for any of us. … She gets way too much screen time, and we get no work done. It’s miserable and unsustainable.” Others wrote about the need to visit the doctor, get a haircut, or go back to work—with proper precautions. Will in Alabama notes that some activities might not be a choice: “My ‘Yeses’ are actually ‘Maybe, if I fucking gotta.’ ” Others, such as Gretchen from Arizona, grappled with the uncertainty and anxiety of the future: “All of my ‘I don’t knows’ are the ones that are the most emotional to me. They all seem like they are a bad idea based on the current situation, but I really don’t think I can go an entire year without hugging someone. … My parents are in their 80s, and are out of state, and I don’t want the last time I saw them to be the last time ever!” Below are the results.

Work and Routine Activities

Routine activities and errands—such as returning to the office, shopping at nonessential businesses, and getting a haircut—produced some of the most evenly divided yes and no responses, when compared with questions about kids, travel, and entertainment.

Returning to the office tied with sending kids back to school for the largest amount of uncertainty in the survey, with 20 percent of respondents checking “I don’t know.” Many people wrote that they hoped to keep working from home, some permanently, but others had bosses who’d made it clear that they were eager for employees to get back, or simply had to return for much-needed paychecks.

“I will go back to my job so I can pay rent. Period. I don’t have the option of working from home, so when my store reopens, I’ll be going back.”

—Jessica, California

“The boss of my company has informed us that we will be back in the office in two weeks, as long as the governor doesn’t extend the stay at home order, and it looks like he probably won’t. I’m concerned about it. I share an office with someone, and I’m getting some messaging from my boss about ‘clean desk initiatives’ and sanitation practices, but … if someone is an asymptomatic carrier, we are all sealed in a building getting prolonged exposure to that person, and maybe not knowing about it for weeks. I don’t understand why it’s a rush to get back in the office. We’ve been handling everything working from home.”

—Barbara, Louisiana

“I’m a psychotherapist, so to go back to the office would require me to sit in close proximity to about 20 different people a week for an hour at a time each. … As long as insurance continues to cover telehealth sessions, I will keep doing that for the foreseeable future, even though I absolutely despise doing Zoom therapy—it’s better than the alternative.”

—Marissa, Illinois

“I’m 78, have immunity issues, and have mild COPD. Getting the bug would almost certainly kill me. On the other hand, I need the money I get from working at the local supermarket. It’s going to be a tough call.”

—Norman, New York

“I’m already shopping in person at liquor stores—if I can do the mental gymnastics required to call that essential, I expect I’ll be able to go to a nonessential business like my local bookstore once it opens.”

—Margaret, Massachusetts

“I’m extremely conflicted. Personally, I want to avoid crowds and avoid being in a store where I may try on clothes someone carrying the virus just tried on. However, I’m also a fashion designer. My company, and my job stability, is partially dependent on people returning to stores. How can I want people to shop from the selfish perspective of hopefully keeping my job, while also not wanting to do that myself?”

—Jessica, New York

“It feels stupid dangerous to go to a hair salon, but I really need it for my mental health. I live alone and am getting increasingly depressed. My only coping mechanism is to put the pandemic out of my mind, but I’m reminded every time I look in the mirror or hop on a conference call. I can’t do blond at home, so I’m hoping that if my hairdresser and I both wear masks and are the only ones there, it will be OK.”

—Cece, Tennessee

“It’s insane thinking you can get personal services done like a haircut or mani/pedi while socially distancing! I’m not dying over beauty. I’ll be DIY’ing it until the virus is well under control. And the beauty police can take a hike for judging otherwise.”

—Robyn, Virginia

Our question about resuming routine doctor’s appointments got one of the highest tallies of yeses. It also offered some of the smallest margins among different demographics. Men and women said yes to going to the doctor in nearly equal numbers. It was also the smallest margin between Democrats and Republicans, with 60 percent of Democrats and 74 percent of Republicans saying they would schedule health care appointments. That still leaves plenty who remain apprehensive.

“I’m turning 40 this summer, with a family history of breast cancer, and will need to start getting mammograms. And my son needs to go to the dentist. But what is ‘necessary’ and what is ‘elective’ now?”

—Sarah, Texas

“I have chronic health issues, that while not acutely life-threatening, do significantly impact my quality of life. I was undergoing testing in order to pursue new treatment approaches when my state’s stay-at-home order was issued. It is hard to put those doctor’s appointments on hold when I know I might find a way to feel much better.”

—Breein, Idaho

Many respondents hoped for expanded absentee voting or voting by mail for the remaining primaries and the November general election. But barring that, many swore to vote by any means necessary: “swim through COVID,” “draped in plastic wrap,” and “crawl through clouds of Ebola” were just a few choice phrases respondents used to describe what they would do to vote. One notable finding: While respondents age 18 to 24 were often more likely than their elders to say they’d be comfortable resuming an activity, voting was one place where they backed off. Compared with respondents ages 25 to 65, fewer young people expressed a willingness to vote in person on Election Day. People over 65 were also less willing to venture to the polls.

“I will vote by mail but if not available because Republicans are trying to suppress voting, I will not be disenfranchised. I would rather be dead.”

—Chris, California

“I would want to show ID when I vote in person on Election Day.”

—Charlie, New York

“I would not ‘feel comfortable’ going out to vote in person. I, however, live in Mississippi and have no reason to believe that the officials of this state will make any allowances for voting other than in person. And I will vote.”

—AZ, Mississippi

Child Care

Questions about child care saw some of the thinnest gender gaps, with moms and dads in largely equal numbers wanting to send kids back to day care, school, or camp—or keep them home. Sending kids back to K–12 produced a high level of uncertainty: 20 percent of respondents said they didn’t know whether they’d send their kids if their districts reopened, the same percentage who were unsure about returning to the office. And the two are correlated for many respondents.

“I need some time away from my kids! Either a nanny/babysitter or back in school. I don’t care. I need a break!!!!!”

—Sasha, Maryland

“I wouldn’t send my kids back to day care because … my kid and his day care is bar none the reason I get sick above all others.”

—Graham, California

“I would hire a nanny or babysitter as soon as possible. … I have a newborn and a 6-year-old, and if I don’t get help soon, I see myself spiraling into [postpartum depression]. I would hire someone I trusted who is also following proper social distancing as much as possible.”

—Austin, Missouri

“Once we [send the kids to day care], we may as well do everything else. I am so tempted, because I am struggling so much with my kids, but they are so touchy-feely and unhygienic—if we send them to camp/afterschool we may as well just have a houseparty and bob for apples.”

—Brenan, Illinois

“If my office ‘allows’ us to return to work, I assume that means work from home is no longer allowed. Therefore, I would need some sort of child care, whether I felt it was safe or not. Likewise with school. I don’t have the luxury to choose not to send my children to school if schools reopen.”

—Laura, Illinois

“My high school kid is really struggling to focus in online school, and I’m at work and not able to monitor him. It feels like the same result as if he had dropped out, and I’m worried about his ability to keep up.”

—Meg, Idaho

“The kids need school and activities. My kids are 9 and 5. They have become anxious, lonely, and bored, all of which contribute to more emotional acting out and some noticeable depression (especially in the older child). It is worth the relatively small risk to send them out so that they can be more socially stable.”

—Monica, California

“My daughter has asthma and is high risk. I dread having to send her back to school before a vaccine. I may not, even if schools open. For us, this doesn’t feel theoretical—it’s life or death.”

—Monica, Washington

We also heard from a few teachers who aren’t certain about the prospect of going back.

“When we reopen, I’ll be headed to the school building, even if it’s unsafe. I’m dedicated to the kids and in a low-risk category, so if I get sick it’s likely not the end of the world. I’ll be fighting tooth and nail for safe policies, the right to wear masks (usually we’re not allowed to cover our face or heads at school except for religious reasons), and even if other teachers are relaxing the rules, I’ll be very strict with my students. They deserve to have an education without getting sick and killing their grandparents.”

—Catherine, Washington

“If schools go back in the fall, I have no choice but to be around 1,200 kids and 300 adults a day. I’m terrified, as my partner is autoimmune compromised.”

—Robin, Georgia

Few respondents will be thrilled to send their kids to day camp if allowed, and even fewer were eager to send kids to sleepaway camp. But as with sending kids back to school, many parents are relying on camps to provide summer child care.

“I said yes to a lot of kid-based [survey questions] because working full time and having a 6-year-old has been impossible. I don’t necessarily think these are the safest out of all the things listed, but I need some other form of child care, so I’m willing to take the associated risks. My daughter’s summer camp has confirmed it will run with lots of precautions in place, and I’m planning on sending her.”

—Celia, Colorado

“I don’t know if I would send my child to day camp because I worry about that being a place the virus can spread. They are outside, and that seems safer, but I don’t know that it is a place that is clean—not washing hands enough, touching shared objects. It’s hard to keep kids 6 feet apart. But if I have to go back to work full time, the only other option is sending her away to my sister, who is a teacher and would be off. And I hate the idea of not seeing my child all summer so I can work.”

—Erica, Connecticut

Dining, Entertainment, and Socializing

People age 18 to 24 were more likely than any other age group to say they are comfortable going to a restaurant, to a movie, or on a date. Entertainment-related questions also represented one of the largest gulfs between Democrats and Republicans, with Republicans expressing far more eagerness to resume these activities.

Pretty much everyone prefers outdoor to indoor dining, but there is a real partisan divide when you dig into the numbers. About 71 percent of Republicans are OK with eating outdoors at a restaurant, versus only 34 percent of Democrats; 50 percent of Republicans say “yes” to eating indoors with social distancing measures, while only 13 percent of Democrats say the same.

“I have been craving a meal at a certain Mexican restaurant that has free queso with your chips, a ‘salsa bar,’ margaritas you need two hands to hold, and the best carne asada tacos ever. It seems a small thing, but it makes me salivate to think about after over a month of cooking at home. Also, the restaurant is locally owned and operated, so my money will stay local for sure.”

—Lori, Oklahoma

“As much as I have missed eating out and want to support our local restaurants, I don’t see how they can provide the distancing and cleanliness required. We are a tourist destination with most coming from Georgia, South Carolina, and Florida. I am concerned that Georgia and Florida leadership has not taken the situation seriously and thus many tourists from those states could travel here carrying the virus into our restaurants.”

—Geneva, North Carolina

About even numbers would attend a dinner or host a dinner, but no one’s in the mood for a party, with 89 percent of respondents saying no.

“Truthfully, I don’t think I could stand the change in behavior that would be necessary for an in-home dinner party. Every interaction would be so strange—do we just freely pass dishes and wine bottles? Should we not all squeeze onto the couch for a movie night? How do board games work now? My friendships are strong enough to survive the awkwardness and boundaries, but it would be heartbreaking to pull ourselves back from connection again and again.”

—Jess, Colorado

Almost no one wants to go to a movie theater: 91 percent of respondents—the highest tally of the survey—rejected the idea of going to a theater without social distancing policies. And 71 percent of respondents are hesitant to go to the theater even with distancing measures.

“I absolutely live for movies. I’m 74. I have doubts that I will ever attend a movie again, I cannot imagine feeling safe.”

—Penny, Colorado

“I would potentially go to an outdoor concert if it was guaranteed that we would all be really spread out and there were spread-out areas for going to the bathroom so not everyone was clustered around the port-a-potties, or ideally if it was short enough that I wouldn’t need to use the restroom while I was there. And no food or beverage service because people would congregate in line. It would have to be a large venue with capacity capped at a much lower number than usual, or a small neighborhood concert in the park.”

—Kelly, Oregon

“Why not just drink a nice hot cup of Plague Espresso?”

—John, Oregon

Dating showed one of the largest gaps between men and women, with 38 percent of men and 24 percent of women willing to get back to it.

“I’m extremely single, and this experience has made me aware of how much I want a romantic relationship. Realistically, that’s going to require some physical contact at some point.”

—Yana, Pennsylvania

“I think for dates, it is just an acceptable risk for me. I cannot stay inside for forever, and I will let my date decide the level of contact they are comfortable with, but a walk outdoors seems pretty safe to me.”

—Brian, North Carolina

“I feel like dating is so awkward normally. A date right now is just going to be even more awkward. People get so weird in general when you tell them deal breakers early on. I imagine trying to have a convo about social distancing/when you can get close would just bring out everyone’s inner weirdo. I’m busy enough dealing with my own inner weirdo.”

—Brenda, Texas

“To go on a date, I’d need to know more details about the other person’s stance on mitigation/distancing. In some ways it feels like any in-person meetup logistics conversation will sound a bit like a safer sex conversation—what are your risk factors, what are your exposure risks, what are your mitigation practices, do our practices line up?”

—Mary, D.C.

Travel

Many respondents expressed concerns about crowds and only wanted to venture to places close to home. But visiting a beach or national park was one of the more acceptable activities.

“The beach is a big part of our lives. I think we could easily maintain proper social distancing while sitting under an umbrella, tossing a football, and boogie boarding. We have always tended to go to the beach before noon or after 5 p.m. anyway, just to avoid crowds and the hottest part of the day, so we’d continue to do that. It would be a huge boost to our happiness and our ability to sustain social distancing for many more weeks/months.”

—Megan, California

“Despite consistent warnings from the governor, our open space and state park trailheads have been packed. We’ve been avoiding those and will continue to do so, but we might consider doing some backcountry camping in the coming months. Definitely no campgrounds or anywhere with shared facilities.”

—Kathleen, Colorado

“I think this may be an urban/rural divide question. We live out in the sticks right near a national park, and have been going there regularly throughout lock-in. My wife and I rarely see a soul, and when we do, it’s ‘howdy!’ and wave from a distance. If we still lived in L.A.? Definitely would not be going to Venice Beach or Griffith Park, nor to our own park now if there were a bunch of people/cars. Ultimately, it’s situational.”

—Alex, Vermont

“Renting a vacation house just seems unethical right now. We don’t want to unwittingly spread the virus to rural communities just because it would be nice to get away. And going to a beach or national park also seems unnecessary. We’ll be able to do those things again but why expose others, and ourselves, to risk for something so optional?”

—Robin, Wisconsin

“For a rental vacation house, I’m fairly confident in my cleaning skills so would come prepared to clean all surfaces and bring my own linens. I might also rent Saturday but not show up until Sunday to give anything in the air time to settle. And it would have to be in driving distance and not require a stop on the way.”

—Amy, North Carolina

“What’s the point of flying anywhere or staying in a vacation house, other than to meet new and interesting people to breathe on and get breathed on by in return? And isn’t going on vacation an insult to all the people who’ve been sent on involuntary vacation over the past two months?”

—Jess, Texas

“The only reason I say I don’t know rather than no is because I already have a vacation booked for July. They make it so hard to cancel!”

—Belinda, Missouri

“I had to cancel my honeymoon because of the pandemic, and as much as I am itching to get on a trans-Atlantic flight and take a sorely needed vacation, it’s definitely not the first thing I’m doing. I want to be clear of a second wave before I get on a flight.”

—Ben, New York

“My father has been locked down in a nursing home and can no longer work a phone. So, I have to go there and see him in person to assess how he is doing. I could be risking the lives of the entire nursing home and all the workers just because I need to see my ailing father. This is a horrible Sophie’s choice, and I really should not do it, but I know I will.”

—Mark, Texas

“I am terrified to visit my 86-year-old grandmother. We just lost my grandfather in December of 2019. Now not only can we not visit her, but she is also alone for the first time in 60 years. It breaks my heart that she is alone and sad. The idea of losing Gram is terrifying, so I am staying away.”

—Melissa, Montana

“My mother is 91 (and a half!) years old and lives in a different state. We had to cancel our trip to see her in April. The last thing I want to do is go visit her and carry the virus to her, in which case she would likely die from it. … But let’s face it, at her age every day is a gift, and I don’t want to put off visiting her for so long that she dies in the next year while I wait for a vaccine, meaning I would never see her alive again.”

—Susan, California

Physical Contact

Shaking hands elicited one of the most decisive responses. Nearly 90 percent of respondents said no to handshaking, and many called the tradition “outdated” and “gross” and hoped the pandemic would hasten its demise. Hugging was the single largest divide among age groups: 65 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds said they would hug friends, compared with 36 percent of 25- to 34-year-olds, 27 percent of 45- to 54-year-olds, and 16 percent of 65- to 74-year-olds. About one-fifth of respondents said they were unsure about hugging a friend.

“I think I will really miss shaking hands, but it’s not always necessary and just seems like both an unnecessary risk and an easy way to protect someone else.”

—Sean, Ohio

“Shaking hands, screw it, dumb tradition. Just hit ‘em with the curtsy before they can offer and see what they do. Or, if you’re truly second level, give them the extended-hand ‘psyche’ and hair brush-back. Frankly, that should be the new normal.”

—Russell, Kentucky

“I’m unsure about shaking hands, as I had a [tradesman] come over who held out his hand, and I shook it before I thought about it. Habit? I felt rude not doing it, though I would have preferred not to.”

—Annmarie, Texas

“I’m fine with never shaking hands again, but damn, I don’t think I can live without hugs.”

—Emily, Washington

“I desperately need a hug. I’m grieving the loss of my husband and dealing with my mom’s severe illness. I’m willing to risk a hug with a close friend if they are willing to risk it with me.”

—Lori, California

“I want so very much to hug and kiss my 90-year-old mom, but I would never forgive myself if she became sick.”

—Heidi, Washington

“Hug a friend—I don’t care if it’s risky. I know it is. But I love my friends, and I miss them, and want to hug them.”

—Xan, Pennsylvania

The military has the authority to treat troops with drugs approved for other conditions or with newly developed drugs, which presents a legal challenge due to existing laws protecting military personnel by recognizing that their obligation to follow orders reduces their ability to provide informed consent.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Infectious disease has always been one of the military's greatest threats. By its own estimates, the US Army lost almost as many soldiers from the 1918 flu as died on the battlefields of the first World War.

Troops are at risk during an outbreak due to the tight quarters in which they live and work. It is therefore not surprising that all branches of the service — Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force and Coast Guard — have been hit hard by COVID-19.

The military has also played an important role in responding to the virus, from evacuating State Department officials from Wuhan in January to its current role building and staffing civilian field hospitals and augmenting civilian research teams.

To mitigate any risk, the Department of Defense has enforced rigorous social distancing policies and a military-wide travel ban halting nonessential deployments.

New treatments

But in addition to measures aimed at keeping people away from sources of infection, the military is also treating active-duty personnel who become infected. Because the COVID-19 virus is new, there are as yet no FDA approved treatments.

As a result, military physicians are turning to either treatments approved for other conditions or seeking access to newly developed treatments, such as the antiviral Remdesivir, which to date has received FDA emergency use approval only for COVID-19 patients with severe conditions. That presents a significant legal challenge due to existing laws protecting military personnel by recognizing that their obligation to follow orders reduces their ability to provide informed consent.

As an expert in public health law and human subject research, I study the tension between protecting participants of biomedical research and responding quickly to emerging threats. But I have also had personal experience with the events that led to the passing of the law that allows the military to work with the FDA in order to get emergency authorization to respond quickly to emerging threats.

Gulf War syndrome

In 1998, I was working for now US Senator, then Connecticut Attorney General, Richard Blumenthal when I met Russ Dingle and Thomas ""Buzz"" Rempfer, two remarkable airmen who filed a whistleblower complaint seeking protection from what they described as forced participation in an unlawful research experiment.

Specifically, they asserted that the Department of Defense was mandating that all active duty personnel be vaccinated against anthrax using a product, AVA, not yet approved by the FDA for the purpose the Army was now using it.

The vaccine had been in use since the 1970s to protect wool workers and veterinarians at risk from touching naturally occurring anthrax spores, but had not been approved for protection against inhaling them, a method of spread reportedly developed by Iraqi scientists as a bioweapon.

But many in the military were reluctant to be vaccinated because of their concern that it might be a cause of Gulf War Syndrome. To this day, there is no agreement about the specific symptoms, let alone cause, of Gulf War Syndrome.

A 2000 report by the well-respected Institute of Medicine found ""no conclusive link to the vaccine."" But the causal connection seemed plausible to many sufferers, especially given the continuing emergence of long-term harm suffered by veterans of the Vietnam War and their children from exposure to Agent Orange.

The whistleblower's primary claim was that the anthrax vaccination program was ""research"" and therefore the army was required to abide by two different protections. The first, called the Common Rule, is a law establishing that all research conducted by the federal government require the informed consent of participants.

Their second claim was that even if it was being used as a preventative measure, the Department of Defense was constrained by a 1998 law passed in direct response to concerns over possible links between unapproved drugs and Gulf War Syndrome. It prohibited ""the administration of investigational new drugs, or drugs unapproved for their intended use, to service members without their informed consent"" unless consent was waived by the president.

Blumenthal wrote to the secretary of defense warning him that administering an unapproved vaccine risked violating both laws and demanding that the research be stopped. That letter became part of a larger debate over whether the military's need for force protection exceeded the risks to any individual serviceperson.

Emergency use

Steve Mitchell/AP

In 2003, Col. Rempfer and six other at first unnamed plaintiffs brought suit in federal court which resulted in a preliminary injunction halting the vaccine program.

Responding to the lawsuit, the Department of Defense denied that they were conducting research and claimed the authority to waive consent because it was necessary to prevent infection with weaponized anthrax.

But in winning the battle, those seeking to stop the vaccine program lost the war. The Department of Defense appealed to Congress for a workaround. It resulted in the passing of the BioShield Act in 2004, creating the Emergency Use Authorization.

This gave the FDA authority to recharacterize the status of a drug or vaccine from investigational to approved for emergency use. In December of 2005 it issued a ""final order concluding that [the Anthrax Vaccine] was the best available medical countermeasure to the potential military emergency.""

Although Col. Rempfer filed a lawsuit to protest the FDA's decision, it was to no avail, and shortly afterward the Department of Defense resumed the vaccine program. Col. Dingle died of cancer in 2008, but Col. Rempfer remained critical of the anthrax vaccine program and still actively advocates on behalf of past and future military personnel.

A compromise

US Navy/MCS 2nd Class Alex Corona

Since the passage of the BioShield Act, Congress has continued to support the FDA's authority to make unapproved drugs available in response to new threats. In 2017, the Department of Defense sought power to unilaterally authorize use of unapproved drugs in battlefield situations.

In the face of FDA objections to this level of autonomy, Congress created a compromise measure memorialized in a Memorandum of Understanding that allows the Department of Defense broad authority to declare the need for emergency use permission and request that the FDA ""take actions to expedite the development of a medical product."" But final authority to issue an emergency use order rests with the president.

It is because of the servicemen committed to the preservation of informed consent that troops today have early access to potential COVID-19 drugs and vaccines while still respecting their vulnerability as patients without the complete ability to give informed consent.

But surprisingly, many Americans aren't taking this approach during the global coronavirus pandemic. New credit card applications were down 40% from the first week of March to the last week, according to a new report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's (CFPB) Consumer Credit Panel. The report looked at hard inquiry data, or the number of times consumers' credit was pulled for an application. Results revealed that the credit card industry is not the only one seeing a drop; auto loan inquiries have decreased by 52% and mortgage inquiries by 27%. What's a hard inquiry? Each time you apply for credit, the lender will perform a ""hard inquiry"" or ""soft inquiry."" Hard inquiries are the most common and appear on your credit report after you submit an application, which may ding your credit score temporarily. Meanwhile, soft inquiries have no effect on your credit. The CFPB cited that this sharp drop in new inquiries could be due to a lowered demand for credit (people are spending less), or a drop in credit supply that may indirectly or directly raise consumers' expectation of being turned down for credit. In other words — consumers expect it will be harder to qualify for credit or a loan, given the number of banks scaling back on lending during the market's current conditions.

Why people with higher credit scores are applying for fewer cards

Suprisingly, card applications declined significantly more for consumers with super prime scores (above a 780 VantageScore) compared to consumers with deep subprime scores (below 500), at a rate of 59% and 34%, respectively. The CFPB pointed out that while all types of inquiries declined notably, consumers with higher credit scores had the most substantial drop. This could indicate they have more flexibility in substituting new credit applications with other means of financial support, such as emergency savings or passive income. Regardless if you have savings or not, you may still want to apply for a credit card. A new card can provide an extended credit limit, which is something you may need if you've recently been laid off or had your credit limit reduced without notice. It could also reward you with cash back for stocking up on groceries and streaming Netflix. But before you apply for a new credit card, we review some tips below.

Academician Yevgeny Mikrin, general designer of Russian Space Corporation Energia, who was earlier diagnosed with coronavirus, died in Moscow. The scientist died at Kommunarka hospital near Moscow, which specializes on the treatment of Covid-positive patients.

""He was 64 years old. He was a very bright person who devoted his whole life to the development of the domestic space program. He was the general designer of NPO Energia, and was in charge of the manned program.

Find all our Lessons of the Day here.Lesson OverviewFeatured Article: “Welcome to the Virosphere” by Carl ZimmerSARS-CoV-2, also known as the coronavirus that causes Covid-19, was isolated and identified by Chinese virologists in January. However, it is only one of 6,828 named species of virus, among thousands, or even trillions, that have yet to be named.
In this lesson you will learn about the history of identifying viruses and how virologists identify and classify viruses today. Then you will participate in a citizen scientist project that involves identifying the different stages of a virus.
Warm UpWhat do you know about the structure and transmission of the coronavirus?Look at the images below from left to right. The first image shows the coronavirus and the second image illustrates what happens as the virus enters a vulnerable cell.
Can you label the rest of the images? Here are some key words you will need to use: viral RNA, viral protein and viral copies.
Hint: The fifth image illustrates a close-up version of the fourth image.
Once you have labeled the images to the best of your ability, check your answers using the original article, “How Coronavirus Hijacks Your Cells.”
As you read the featured article, apply your knowledge of the coronavirus to understand and visualize how other viruses can be identified.
Questions for Writing and DiscussionRead the article, then answer the following questions:1. How do virologists search for new viruses? How do today’s approaches differ from earlier methods of researching viruses?
2. What does the research of Matthew Sullivan, a virologist at Ohio State University, demonstrate about the diversity of viruses in the sea?
3. How did Chinese researchers and virologists isolate and identify the virus that causes Covid-19 earlier this year? How did the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses name the virus?
4. How do viruses infect and affect humans compared to other species?5. Why is it so hard for virologists to classify viruses?
6. Why did Jens H. Kuhn, the lead virologist at the Integrated Research Facility at Fort Detrick in Maryland, and his colleagues create the “megataxonomy”? How have other researchers responded to his creation?
Going FurtherNow that you know about the process that virologists undertake to identify and classify viruses, you are going to participate in a citizen scientist project to identify the stages of a virus.
Diamond Light Source is the United Kingdom’s national synchrotron. The synchrotron produces bright light that scientists can use to study anything from fossils to jet engines to viruses and vaccines. In 2019, Diamond Light Source began a virus factory and enlisted the participation of the public, as citizen scientists. The first stage of this research is complete; however, you can still participate in the work of citizen scientists to study reoviruses.
According to Diamond Light Source’s Science Scribbler:Reoviruses belong to a large family of viruses that infect a wide range of animals and plants. Some members of the family cause widespread disease, notably Rotaviruses, which are responsible for serious gastroenteritis. In contrast, reoviruses themselves, whilst they pervasively infect humans, do not typically produce symptoms, indeed they are being trialled as possible anti-cancer agents, since they specifically replicate in many cancer cells activated for division. They are therefore a good starting point to try to understand the life-cycle of this family of viruses.Now you will identify and classify the four stages of the virus, following the instructions provided. Once you have completed several tasks, you can look at some of the other biology and science-related citizen scientist projects on Zooniverse and try another.",real

Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said Wednesday that all city and county residents who want a coronavirus test can now get one for the first time since COVID-19 cases began appearing there in January.

Free COVID-19 testing is available to any L.A. County resident. https://t.co/13jZaOOegy — MayorOfLA (@MayorOfLA) April 30, 2020

The announcement, which makes Los Angeles one of the first major cities in the nation to offer free testing to all its residents, came on the same day that county health officials reported a surge in the number of new COVID-19 cases, which they attributed in part to more widespread testing.

The Los Angeles County Health Department confirmed another 1,541 cases — its largest single-day increase since the start of the pandemic. It also reported 56 additional deaths because of the coronavirus.

Health officials say despite the uptick, the rate of hospitalization and death in the county has remained steady. Los Angeles County now has a total of nearly 22,500 confirmed cases — accounting for nearly half of California's more than 46,000.

Until now, because of a scarcity of test kits, only people showing symptoms of COVID-19, essential workers and those in institutional settings such as nursing homes could receive a test in Los Angeles.

Garcetti's announcement could be a significant milestone, because health officials say without widespread testing they are unable to accurately track the spread of the disease. That information could then be used to determine when it is safe to ease stay-at-home orders.

Now, any LA city or county resident who wants a test can make an appointment and get one at one of dozens of testing sites in the area, the mayor said at a news conference on Wednesday.

But he added that people showing symptoms would still be given priority for testing.

Garcetti said Los Angeles currently accounts for about 9% of all the tests nationwide.

Biden’s Campaign Vetting Klobuchar As Potential Running Mate,"The Senator from Minnesota has been asked by the Biden campaign to submit materials for consideration. No word if she threw the binder at the staffers.

Senator Klobuchar(D-MN) is officially going through the “invasive” vetting process as a potential running mate for Joe Biden.

Klobuchar is just the latest in the list of candidates being floated.

CBS News broke the story yesterday.

Trending: After ‘Suffering In Hell’ During His COVID Treatment Coma, Drummer Rejects Satanic Beliefs The request for information from potential running mates like Klobuchar “is underway,” a senior Biden campaign aide tells CBS News. If a potential contender consents, she should be poised to undergo a rigorous multi-week review of her public and private life and work by a hand-picked group of Biden confidantes, who will review tax returns, public speeches, voting records, past personal relationships and potentially scandalous details from her past… …Biden has publicly credited Klobuchar for strong debate performances and for helping him win Minnesota, a victory that came only after she and other contenders dropped out just hours before March’s Super Tuesday primaries that helped propel Biden into the lead. He is on track to officially clinch the Democratic presidential nomination next month after several states hold primaries rescheduled because of the coronavirus pandemic… …”I need someone who’s going to be, as Barack said, ‘simpatico with me,’ who is a real partner in progress and is ready to be president on a moment’s notice,” Biden said recently. “There are a lot of women out there with the experience to do that job.” Source: CBS News

The question isn’t “Is America ready for a female Vice President”, it’s “Is America ready for a female Vice President that ate salad with a comb and made her staffer clean it after she was finished?”

Klobuchar’s anger problems are legendary–it’s the stuff of NYTimes columns and mockery in The Atlantic.

This might be the very first zero personality ticket for president in the history of the United States.

Don’t believe me? Check out Amy Klobuchar’s “joke” that she keeps telling.

Amy Klobuchar has a joke she'd like you to hear pic.twitter.com/5mh5IQepva — The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) September 6, 2019

On the plus side, Klobuchar seems to have a very good memory and if Joe forgets what he’s doing, she’ll just throw a stapler at him–or maybe one of Speaker Pelosi’s commemorative pens. (After all, she’s going to be the one pulling Joe’s strings.)

As for Joe, he’s just a shadow of his former self.

Not only can he no longer be “flirty” with women with unwanted touching and hair-sniffing because of the MeToo era and a sexual assault accusation against him, he’s just falling apart.

Here is his April 2019 video announcing that he was entering the race for President:

Joe has always been gaffe-prone, but clearly something has changed in just the past few months.

There has been a distinct decline in Joe’s mental acuity and having him locked down in his Delaware home due to coronavirus is helping him hide it. Unfortunately, he still has to do some campaigning, and when he does, it’s pretty clear that things are not so great with Joe.

Here he is forgetting who the health experts briefing him on coronavirus are–despite his near-constant use of notes.

Yikes!

He’s literally got a binder with all of his information in front of him–unless Klobuchar got her hands on it and threw it at some staffer for the Biden Virtual Rally “glitches.”

Don’t get me wrong, Klobuchar is perhaps the least insane of the Democrats that decided to run for the nomination, and wouldn’t actually be the most awful pick. She just has the likeability of a turnip. She’s also a “moderate” from a purple state and that may not go over well with the Bernie Bro/AOC/”Democratic Socialist” wing of the Democratic party. But perhaps its because “moderate” Joe has morphed into Bernie Lite and needs someone moderate to balance him out.

Whoever wins these “Veepstakes” it’s clear that their primary job will be to prop up Joe Biden.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson plans to reduce the role of Huawei in the U.K.’s 5G network in the wake of the coronavirus crisis, according to reports in the Guardian and the Telegraph.

Johnson has instructed officials to draft plans that would reduce Huawei’s involvement in building the U.K.’s 5G phone network to zero by 2023, the Telegraph reported.

The move marks a departure from the U.K. government’s previous position. In January, Johnson said he would allow the Chinese tech giant to build up to 35 percent of its 5G phone network but block access to “sensitive core” parts of the network.

The push for new plans comes amid growing backlash among Conservative MPs against Chinese investment and a lack of transparency around Beijing’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, according to the Telegraph.

The paper also reported Johnson hopes to ramp up trade talks with the United States, which has been one of the most vocal critics of the U.K.’s decision to allow Huawei into its market, citing security concerns.

The reports “simply don’t make sense,” Huawei Vice President Victor Zhang said in a statement. “As a private company, 100% owned by employees, which has operated in the UK for 20 years, our priority has been to help mobile and broadband companies keep Britain connected, which in this current health crisis has been more vital than ever. This is our proven track-record.”

886,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jason-isbell-album-reunions-coronavirus-pandemic/,2020-05-14,"Jason Isbell on releasing his new album during a pandemic: ""I need to feel a connection with people""","Alabama-born Jason Isbell has become one of the country's most acclaimed singer-songwriters. His last two albums debuted atop the country and rock charts and each won him a pair of Grammys.

But he recorded his new album, ""Reunions,"" in what now seems like another time. It will be released Friday, in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic.

""That's not what I planned on, but I would have been super disappointed if I had to wait,"" Isbell told ""CBS This Morning"" co-host Anthony Mason. ""And I think, you know, people don't need music any less right now than they will a year from now.""

He needs it even more now, he said. ""I need to feel a connection with people.""

On their farm outside Nashville, Isbell and his wife, the musician Amanda Shires, have been hunkering down at home with their 4-year-old daughter, Mercy.

Mercy can tell something is different, Isbell said.

""She even kind of misses being on tour 'cause, you know, she goes on tour with us. So she's said a few times, 'Can we pretend we're in a hotel today, Daddy?' I'm like, 'Yeah, we can do that,'"" he said.

Isbell said he doesn't know when he will be back on tour.

""Sometimes I let myself think about how nice it will be to play shows again with my band and with an audience and ride around and see new things, but I don't stay there for too awful long 'cause then I get sad,"" he said.

He has found this time challenging, he told Mason. ""You know, we lost John Prine a month ago, and that's been devastating for us.""

Prine died of the coronavirus in early April. Isbell and Shires both had performed on his final album, ""The Tree of Forgiveness,"" and had toured with the revered singer-songwriter.

""When John passed, it occurred to me that, you know, there's no such thing as overreacting at this point because if John's loss had been the only one, it would still be enough to keep us in the house for however long it takes,"" Isbell said.

So, he's been performing his new music from the studio in his barn. Isbell has said that he dealt with a lot of ghosts on his new record.

""I didn't know that's what was happening while I was writing the songs,"" he said.

One of those ghosts was his own: the alcoholic Isbell before his recovery eight years ago.

""For the first few years after I got sober and straightened my life up, it was dangerous for me to forgive myself,"" Isbell said. ""Because I didn't want to turn back into that guy.""

""You're okay being with that guy again?"" Mason asked.

""Yeah, for once, and it's taken a long time 'cause, I mean, everybody has that friend that, you know, they can't hang out with 'cause it's like, if I go out with that guy tonight, I'm going to wind up in trouble. Well, that was my own self, you know?"" Isbell said.

Isbell said the pressure to live up to his earlier albums also meant ""Reunions"" had a somewhat tortured birth.

""We could have had a better time, but I don't think we could have made a better album,"" he said. ""And, you know, now the album's done. We can have a good time now.""",real
946,https://chicago.suntimes.com/education/2020/5/14/21258988/some-us-schools-pulling-the-plug-on-distance-learning-stay-at-home-order-coronavirus-covid-19,2020-05-14,Some US schools are pulling the plug on distance learning,"CUSSETA, Ga. — After the Chattahoochee County school district called an early end to the school year, seniors lined up one day last week to complete their graduation paperwork. Students who hadn’t seen each other since in-person classes ended abruptly in March amid the coronavirus outbreak commiserated over all they’ve missed out on, including the prom and a senior class trip.

Some also wondered about what they may have lost academically.

“Honestly, remote learning, I don’t think was my favorite thing,” said 18-year-old Isabella Branson. “It’s kind of hard to stay motivated when you don’t have anything to look forward to and you don’t see your friends.”

The small district in rural Georgia is among many around the U.S. that have pulled the plug on distance learning, all citing familiar reasons. It’s too stressful, the lack of devices and internet access is too much to overcome, and what students get from it just isn’t worth the struggle.

In Georgia, where the school year is ending early for one of every 10 students, many district leaders say the final weeks of the school year would have been dedicated anyway to preparing for and taking standardized tests that are now canceled. The governor and state schools superintendent who have moved to dismantle parts of Georgia’s high-stakes testing system have said they are not opposed to fewer instructional days.

“We didn’t cut any class time out,” Chattahoochee County High School Principal Josh Kemp said. “There was no reason to pile more on our parents and students.”

But Kemp and others also acknowledge that there was material that wasn’t covered and that teachers will have to find a way to fold it in next year for returning students.

“They weren’t able to get all the standards,” said Tammy Bailey, the science department chair at the high school. “I think there will be a gap.”

Classes had been scheduled to run through May 21 but remote instruction instead came to an end May 8 in the Chattahoochee County school district. A majority of the high school’s 450 students live on the U.S. Army’s sprawling Fort Benning, while a minority live around the small town of Cusseta. Only 59% of households in the district have access to broadband internet at home.

Other districts around the country that are ending the school year early including Omaha and some nearby suburban districts in Nebraska, Washington, D.C., and some in New Hampshire. Officials say they want to relieve stress on families, ease problems for students without internet access, and focus on preparing for a fresh start in the fall.

The last three weeks of school is “probably not prime instructional time,” said Andrew McEachin, an education policy researcher at RAND Corp. But he said that kids in struggling households may suffer most from being cut off from the normalcy of a school routine.

“I think the biggest thing about cutting a school year short is not what it does on average, but what it does on equity,” McEachin said. “Even if school isn’t working as well as we want it to be, that may be the best access low income students have to learning.”

Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, said on April 16 that he trusted schools to set their calendars and the following day, state Superintendent Richard Woods wrote that schools’ focus during the pandemic should “not be on test scores” but on making sure children are “healthy, safe and nurtured.”

But Michael O’Sullivan, executive director of GeorgiaCAN, a group that supports Georgia’s testing system, says this spring has been a preview of a “zero-accountability world.”

“It’s the easy way out of a very difficult situation, but that doesn’t mean it’s going to be good for kids,” O’Sullivan said.

Some schools in Georgia are making plans to combat academic losses from the year, such as beefed-up summer sessions. The Scintilla Charter Academy in Valdosta is aiming to start the next school year on July 23, to make up the time it lost when it ended on April 30.

Scintilla Dean of School Mandy Avera said her families were “stressed and overwhelmed” by online learning. The school covers kindergarten through sixth grade, and Avera is among educators who question whether younger children can successfully acquire critical skills like learning to read without a face-to-face interaction with a teacher.

“It just created a situation where we just can’t be as interactive as we like to be at Scintilla,” Avera said. “Kindergartners don’t understand why they’re at home. They don’t understand why they can’t go back to school and see their friends and see their teachers.”

Back in Cusseta, some seniors were stressing about being able to bring only four guests to a socially-distant graduation ceremony, while others were disregarding imposed distance to hug and gossip. But Chattahoochee County Superintendent Kristi Brooks was already trying to think about the next school year, despite uncertainty on whether in-person classes will resume.

“They’re going to have missed 60 days of instruction,” Brooks said “When we come back for the fall, we’re going to have to pick up in some basic areas.”",real

UPDATED 4-18-20

There is increasing evidence that COVID-19 isn’t your typical virus. Thankfully many researchers, scientists and doctors are observing trends that are changing the way we are treating it in hospitals and at home.

I should be writing this at the beginning of all my articles in the last month but due to the fact that we are all living in real time and the information coming out is changing moment by moment even the best scientist’s theories on how to combat this illness continue to evolve. Although things could certainly change as larger studies come forth, for the moment I wanted to share with you some exciting new details that are emerging theories, which could affect future treatment development.

Current Theory and Treatment for Coronavirus

Currently COVID-19 is being treated as a dysfunction of the lower respiratory tract. It’s primary symptoms are:(1)

Fever Cough Shortness of breath

Interestingly, a large number of COVID-19 patients also report a loss of taste and smell. In mild cases of COVID-19, the virus will run its course and resolve on its own. But if this disease progresses to a critical level, patients spiral into a state of severe hypoxemia – where the body is unable to effectively deliver life-sustaining oxygen to the rest of the body. Without adequate oxygen delivery, vital organs and tissues are starved of oxygen and begin shutting down – which can eventually lead to death.

The current treatments assume that coronavirus is causing a build-up of liquid (instead of air) in the alveoli – making it difficult for oxygen to transfer through the fluid and make its way into the bloodstream. To counteract oxygen deprivation caused by this build up of fluid, COVID-19 is currently being treated as a case of acute respiratory distress, also known as ARDS. The standard treatment for ARDS is mechanical ventilation – which will force air into the alveoli in hopes of transferring oxygen into the blood.

The problem is, treating COVID-19 with ventilation isn’t working like it should. In fact, some doctors have observed that the use of ventilators may even be harming some patients. So that brings up the question – what if our current understanding of COVID-19 is wrong?

Emerging ideas on the virus…

There is mounting evidence suggesting that our initial understanding of exactly how coronavirus impacts the body may be incorrect.

Consider these mysteries of COVID-19:

Patients are showing blood oxygen levels so low that they should be life-threatening, but without showing the typical signs of distress that are expected when the same levels are reached due to lung dysfunction. (2) Doctors are saying that ventilators aren’t working as well as they should be and may even be harming some people. (2) Many patients report a loss of taste and smell, typically associated with zinc deficiency, not respiratory disease. Researchers have noted that the pathological mechanism that causes the damage to the body remains a mystery. (3) Twenty percent of COVID-19 patients have cardiac damage. (4) Fatality rates, even among places with robust testing in place, are wildly different.

These discrepancies have hinted at a new culprit as well as new possible solutions. So, should we be treating COVID-19 differently? To answer that question, first let’s look at exactly how a healthy body is designed to deliver oxygen to your tissues.

How Our Cells Are Designed Carry Oxygen

As you inhale air, oxygen enters your lungs and reaches the alveoli which is lined with a layer of cells that creates the barrier between your lungs and your bloodstream. Oxygen molecules pass through this barrier and attach themselves to a protein called hemoglobin that is bound to your red blood cells. Once your red blood cells have picked up oxygen, they set off to begin delivering it to the rest of the tissues in your body.

Think of your red blood cells like little rafts that are responsible for picking up oxygen and carrying it to your tissues which rely on oxygen for survival. And think of hemoglobin like people on the raft working as a delivery crew – tasked with receiving, holding, and dropping off oxygen molecules. Without the “delivery crew” of hemoglobin proteins, the raft is useless.

It’s also important to understand a little more about the structure of hemoglobin. A vital component of hemoglobin proteins are heme groups – which are embedded in the hemoglobin and are responsible for binding and releasing oxygen molecules.These heme groups are a metal complex and contain iron as the central metal atom, with each iron molecule capable of carrying one oxygen molecule.5 These iron rich heme groups are critical – without them your cells are unable to transport the oxygen your tissues depend on.

This understanding the body carries oxygen has sparked speculation about how COVID-19 may be exerting it’s devastating effects by creating more reactive oxygen species causing tissue damage and hypoxia.

A New Theory on COVID-19’s Mechanism of Injury

One the most puzzling aspects of COVID-19, is that despite fitting most of the criteria under the definition of acute respiratory failure there is one glaring contradiction. With the coronavirus, there appears to be hypoxia or low oxygen saturation in the blood rather than respiratory distress as seen in classic respiratory failure. Meaning many patients present with severe hypoxia with nearly normal respiratory function.6 This remarkable combination is almost never seen in severe cases of ARDS.

Interestingly, it may be creating a clinical picture similar to someone suffering from severe malaria or altitude illness.

Could COVID-19 Be affecting Oxygen Carrying Capacity?

In COVID-19’s final and severe stages, the lungs are severely damaged. But new information on this virus’s cellular process in the body is revealing that the final condition of the lungs and accompanying respiratory failure may actually be more of a case of massive oxidative stress overload disrupting the capacity of hemoglobin to carry oxygen to tissues rather than an outright attack on the air sacs in the lungs.

The theory on coronavirus affecting the blood's oxygen carrying capacity is related to the fact that increased intracellular oxidative stress is at the core of all pathogenic infections. This is often referred to as an increase in reactive oxygen species or ROS. This ROS production is at the core of much of the damage we are seeing not only to the blood’s ability to deliver oxygen to the tissues, causing severe hypoxia or low oxygen but also damaging all tissues they come in contact with. As Integrative and functional medicine doctors, we often measure markers of oxidative stress in our patient’s urine to determine if this process is out of control. One such marker is lipid peroxides. According to Dr. Tom Levy the intracellular levels of Vitamin C, magnesium and glutathione largely affect the oxidative stress which could damage the tissues, one reason why you are seeing Vitamin C being used in hospitals to treat the virus. Stay tuned as I will be writing more about Vitamin C in upcoming blog articles.

This cascade of events would explain:

Why as many as one in five COVID-19 patients have cardiac damage. Why IV nutrients that target cardiovascular function are beneficial. Why many people experience a loss of taste and smell. Why anti-malarial medications are showing promising results.

This would also explain why ventilators aren’t working quite like we’d expect. Ventilators work by forcing more air into the lungs, so more oxygen can be delivered to the blood. This is helpful when there’s liquid or inflammation in the lungs, and the blood is working normally – like in pneumonia. However, if there is an issue due to the fact that oxidative stress (ROS) has altered the blood’s ability to properly carry this oxygen, then a ventilator can’t do its job. Right now, the Journal of the American Medical Association indicates that COVID-19 patients are candidates for “early, invasive ventilation”. But if we’re ventilating patients who are struggling to keep their little oxygen boats afloat in the bloodstream due to massive oxidative stress, ventilation will do little good and could even cause damage.(8)

This theory would also give us some more insight as to why certain populations may be more at risk of contracting COVID-19.

This Might Explain Why Anti-malarial Medications are Being Considered for Treatment.

Hydroxychloroquine, also known as Plaquenil, is an anti-malarial medication that is showing promise as a potential treatment for COVID-19. If coronavirus is in fact attacking red blood cells, similar to the way malaria does, then it would make sense why an anti-malarial drug would be beneficial for coronavirus patients. But how exactly could hydroxychloroquine be exerting these antiviral effects?

Research is finding that it might be due to hydroxychloroquine’s relationship with the mineral zinc. You see, hydroxychloroquine is a zinc ionophore – meaning it enhances your body’s ability to allow zinc into your cells.9 When intracellular concentrations of zinc are increased, it displays broad spectrum antiviral activity in a few ways:

Zinc inhibits the actions of certain proteins necessary for the completion of different phases of the virus’s life cycle – essentially halting its ability to reproduce(10) Zinc supports a robust immune response by aiding in the production of cytokines and the modulation of immune cells(10) Zinc acts as a powerful antioxidant and prooxidant – neutralizing the oxidative stress caused by toxic overload of iron that has been dumped into the blood from the burst cells(11,12)

Interestingly, one of the initial symptoms reported by many coronavirus patients is a loss of taste and smell. This lack of taste and smell can be caused by a zinc deficiency. Perhaps the action of hydroxychloroquine helping zinc enter cells is part of the reason the drug has benefitted some COVID-19 patients.13 It’s important to note that in order for hydroxychloroquine to work, there must be adequate zinc levels available to allow into the cells – so hydroxychloroquine must be administered in conjunction with zinc to be most effective against COVID-19.

Hydroxychloroquine has shown promise (as well as a risk of severe cardiac arrhythmia in certain patients) but the way the drug functions has given us some powerful insights and may give us answers into how we can save more lives.

The Connection Between COVID-19 and Altitude Sickness

Another interesting connection is the fact that COVID-19’s clinical presentation is quite similar to another respiratory illness – high altitude pulmonary edema, also known as altitude sickness. In both COVID-19 and high altitude pulmonary edema clinical findings include:(14)

A decreased ratio of arterial oxygen levels to inspired oxygen Hypoxia (low oxygen levels) and tachypnea (abnormally rapid breathing) Low carbon dioxide levels A ground glass appearance in the lung tissues Elevated fibrinogen levels Diffuse alveolar damage

In altitude sickness, the lungs are functioning fine – there are just inadequate levels of oxygen to process to properly meet the needs of the body. Clinical findings similar to altitude sickness would make sense if COVID-19 is in fact causing a dysfunction of red blood cells through production of massive oxidative stress rather than a direct problem with the lungs.

So What Are Potential Options to Quench Oxidative Stress?

Even with all of the information that points to COVID-19 creating massive oxidative stress, there are still a lot of unknowns. The downside of this is of course the trial and error and continued research that needs to take place before we have real answers. The upside, is that this information gives us an array of new potential treatment options to consider:

High Dose Vitamin C:

High doses of vitamin C are garnering attention as a powerful way to potentially mitigate the effects of coronavirus. These ultra-high doses of vitamin C are speculated to fight the massive immune response and subsequent respiratory failure seen in coronavirus infection by:(15,16)

Suppressing the over-reactive inflammatory response in the lungs Minimizing the accumulation of immune cells in the tissues of the lungs Decreasing the release of cytokines (chemical messengers involved in the immune response) Slowing down the viruses ability to reproduce and spread Neutralizing the oxidative stress caused by the massive amounts of iron floating around in the bloodstream

Ideally, high dose vitamin C can be delivered intravenously, where it is more easily absorbed and utilized intracellularly. But oral vitamin C can also be beneficial if taken correctly. While regular over the counter oral vitamin C causes diarrhea, liposomal Vitamin C at frequent intervals does not, and is an effective way to increase intracellular levels. Several New York hospitals have approved intravenous vitamin C as a therapy for the first time ever in studies being conducted on the virus.

Glutathione:

Glutathione is a potent antioxidant naturally found in most of the cells in your body. Glutathione plays a few major roles in immune function including:

Functioning as a signaling molecule – helping balance inflammation levels and modulating immune system response(17) Reducing oxidative injury by neutralizing harmful toxins (18) Regulating cellular proliferation and apoptosis(19)

There is a growing mountain of evidence finding that the most effective way to take glutathione may be through inhalation. Inhaled glutathione (aerosolized or nebulized) is already being used in the treatment of a variety of respiratory-related conditions and has been garnering attention as a possible treatment option for COVID-19.(20)

Inhaled Hydrogen:

The inhalation of concentrated hydrogen gas is another potential treatment option due to its powerful antioxidant properties. Inhaling hydrogen gas has been found to:(21,22)

Reduce oxidative-stress induced damage Reduce cellular apoptosis Improve gas exchange in the lungs Block the production of proinflammatory mediators

Inhaled hydrogen gas may be particularly effective when paired with other anti-oxidative therapies such as IV vitamin C and inhaled glutathione.

Other Antiviral Drugs:

A number of other antiviral medications are being studied for their potential to treat COVID-19. These include:

Methylene Blue : Methylene Blue is a medication that has been used in the treatment of malaria due to its powerful antiviral properties – killing the virus at an impressive speed. (23) It’s also used in the treatment of a condition known as methemoglobinemia – a condition in which individuals have too much methemoglobin which is a form of hemoglobin that is much less effective at carrying oxygen. Methylene blue works by converting methemoglobin into a type of hemoglobin that can more effectively transport oxygen.(24) Remdesivir : Remdesivir is another antiviral drug used for Ebola. Remdesivir is showing benefit in solid studies – a small but well-conducted study on severe cases in the US, Canada, Europe, and Japan concluded that Remdesvir caused clinical improvement in 68% of patients. (25) Favipiravir : Favipiravir is a powerful anti-viral agent that inhibits the virus from replicating and spreading. (26) It has been approved in China and Japan for the treatment of influenza and is undergoing research to determine its potential efficacy in treating COVID-19. (27)

Hyperbaric Treatment:

Hyperbaric treatment works in two ways. First, inspired oxygen concentration is increased to nearly 100%. Secondly, ambient pressure is increased to about three times higher than the air pressure we normally breathe. This combination is designed to essential “hyper oxygenate” your blood – improving oxygen delivery to your tissues.(28)

Hyperbaric treatment may be an effective adjunct therapy to help COVID-19 patients recover, especially when administered early.

Could This Bring Us One Step Closer to Finding a Cure for COVID-19?

There are still many unknowns when it comes to coronavirus. The only thing we know for certain is that we are in a race against time. I hope we will continue to search for clues and change course when wrong.

I urge my fellow clinicians and researchers to examine this virus and its mechanism of action with fresh eyes. We entered into this field knowing we were signing up for being lifetime students. This current pandemic is calling us to rise to the occasion – the world is counting on us to find the answers it needs.

In my own practice, I will continue to give my patients and readers the most up-to-date tools they need to protect themselves amidst this pandemic. Until we have a solid understanding of this virus, I will continue to seek new information to do my part in fighting back against COVID-19 and update you when we find more information to help patients get well.

Give Your Immune System the Support It Needs

Along with continued research to identify the root cause of COVID-19, I am also working on equipping our clinic to offer treatments to support your immune system during this time. Based on our current understanding we may consider offering some of the following options.

IV Vitamin C and Glutathione: A powerful combination of two of the most potent antioxidants delivered intravenously so they can be immediately used by the cells to combat oxidative damage. Inhaled Glutathione: Inhaling glutathione delivers it directly to your lung cells – replenishing their antioxidant stores that are quickly used up when fighting inflammation. Inhaled Hydrogen: Pairing inhaled hydrogen’s impressive anti-inflammatory effects with Vitamin C and glutathione makes for a robust and powerful trio of antioxidant therapies. Nasal Ozone: Ozone gas held in the sinuses helps your body more effectively uptake oxygen and activates a healthy immune response. Ozone should not be inhaled as may damage the lungs.

And fortunately, Flatiron Functional Medicine is certainly not the only place that you may be able to receive these powerful therapies to support the immune system. Many other providers have the resources and training to deliver them as well – so please seek out a reputable and trusted clinician in your area to learn more about these options.",fake

“Even before the pandemic hit, I realized that we were in a revolutionary moment where what would be impossible or even inconceivable in normal times had become not only possible but probably absolutely necessary.”

He added, “And then came COVID-19, which has totally disrupted people’s lives and required very different behavior. It is an unprecedented event that probably has never occurred in this combination. And it really endangers the survival of our civilization.”

Earlier this month, infamous left-wing billionaire George Soros discussed how the coronavirus will shape the world in an interview with Project Syndicate’s Gregor Peter Schmitz.

George Soros is giddy and excited these days, why? Because he sees the COVID-19 “plandemic” doing amazing things to destroy the economy, to destroy capitalism, and the weaken the United States to the breaking point so his army of low-information Liberal minions can swoop in and remake it.

You can watch the PLANDEMIC documentary below:

You will always hear Liberals saying things like ‘transforming America’, ‘changing America’, but you will never hear them talking about America’s greatness because they don’t believe it is.

Soros has been quiet in 2020, but his bank accounts have not, he continues to provide over 1 billion dollars per year to support radical and anarchist Leftist groups and causes.

Black Lives Matter? That’s Soros. ANTIFA? Yep, Soros. All those races riots from a few years back? Yep, that’s Soros too.

George Soros even funded Antichrist-in-training Emmanuel Macron when he ran for president in 2017.

Did you know? America Is Under Attack By 187 Groups Funded By George Soros

You can look for him to provide all the millions necessary for the Democrats to have their ‘mail-in ballot’ election in November, and even if people go to the polls, they are voting with a Soros-financed machine.

These are happy, happy days for Globalist Schwartz György, not since he sided with the Nazis as a teenager to rob his fellow Jewish neighbors and help send them to concentration camps has he been this happy.

Watch the video below, and listen as George Soros tells how that time in his life were some of his happiest moments. Until, that is, the COVID-19 Plannedemic.

George Soros Describes COVID-19 Pandemic As ‘Revolutionary Moment’ In Which ‘Everything Is Up For Grabs’

FROM ACTIVIST MOMMY: In the May 11th interview, Soros referred to the coronavirus ordeal as “the crisis of my lifetime” and gave his radical views for change and progress in the wake of the pandemic.

“Even before the pandemic hit, I realized that we were in a revolutionary moment where what would be impossible or even inconceivable in normal times had become not only possible but probably absolutely necessary,” he said during the interview, adding,

“And then came COVID-19, which has totally disrupted people’s lives and required very different behavior. It is an unprecedented event that probably has never occurred in this combination. And it really endangers the survival of our civilization.”

He went on to say,

“We will not go back to where we were when the pandemic started. That is pretty certain. But that is the only thing that is certain. Everything else is up for grabs. I do not think anybody knows how capitalism will evolve.”

Soros also discussed the “threats” now facing the European Union. Soros is a well-known supporter of the globalist organization. He asserted that “Europe is facing several existential dangers” and that he is “particularly concerned about the survival of the EU because it is an incomplete union.”

According to the Hungarian-born billionaire, the European Union was “in the process of being created,” but that process “was never completed.”

Soros contended that the EU is “exceptionally vulnerable – more vulnerable than the US not just because it is an incomplete union but also because it is based on the rule of law.”

During the interview, the progressive philanthropist also discussed a recent conflict between Germany and the EU that involved a ruling from Germany’s highest court on May 5 that one of the EU’s Court of Justice decisions regarding policies of the European Central Bank (ECB) was not legally binding.

This resulted in the European Court of Justice asserting that it alone had jurisdiction over the ECB.

George Soros, a globalist, sided with the EU during the interview. “When Germany joined the EU, it committed itself to abide by European law,” he argued.

He expressed fears that this ruling “poses a threat that could destroy the European Union as an institution based on the rule of law” as it could lead to other countries like Poland or Hungary to try to become more independent of the EU since “the German court can question the decisions of the European Court of Justice.”

Soros asked, “Can Hungary and Poland decide whether they follow European law or their own courts – whose legitimacy the EU has questioned? That question goes to the very heart of the EU, which is built on the rule of law. Poland has immediately risen to the occasion and asserted the supremacy of its government-controlled courts over European law. In Hungary, Viktor Orbán has already used the COVID-19 emergency and a captured parliament to appoint himself dictator,” Soros claimed.

Soros claims that Orbán has positioned himself as a dictator but a new poll shows that the majority of Hungarians (54 percent) approve of the Orbán administration’s measures and would vote for him in the coming election scheduled for this year. Orbán isn’t the only world leader Soros labeled as a dictator.

In the interview he briefly talked about President Donald Trump, accusing him of wanting “to be a dictator” but going on to say that “he cannot be one because there is a constitution in the United States that people still respect.”

George Soros remained vague in discussing the “things” President Trump allegedly wants to do but said the constitution “will prevent him from doing certain things” but that it isn’t stopping Trump from trying “because he is literally fighting for his life.”

He went on to add,

“I will also say that I have put my faith in Trump to destroy himself, and he has exceeded my wildest expectations.”

It’s safe to assume that Soros has labeled Trump as an aspiring dictator simply because POTUS presents opposition for the progressive, globalist agenda that Soros heavily finances and actively advocates for.

He has $5.1 million alone invested in a super PAC that is dedicated to funding groups working against the re-election of President Trump.

George Soros also notoriously finances left-wing causes throughout the United States and around the world to the tune of $1 billion each year including abortion, euthanasia, population control, transgenderism, and same-sex “marriage.”

If there ever was an arch-nemesis for conservatives, Soros would most definitely be it. (Read more)

In March, the World Health Organization declared that the virus was a pandemic.

Coronaviruses are common in many types of animals and can sometimes jump to humans. In this case, the virus probably originally came from a bat. Two other coronaviruses have infected humans, causing outbreaks of SARS and MERS in 2002 and 2012, respectively.

The illness caused by the new coronavirus, COVID-19, appears to cause fever, cough, and difficulty breathing. Other symptoms include loss of taste and smell and gastrointestinal problems. Some people never display symptoms but could still infect others. The illness appears to be severe in around a quarter of COVID-19 patients, and thousands of people have died from the disease in the US and around the world.

Public health officials are still trying to control raging outbreaks in many countries, and scientists are searching for treatments. As that work continues, businesses are shuttered, hospitals are struggling, and millions of people are staying quarantined for their safety and the safety of others.

Many said the pandemic has led them to believe that in-person meetings are often unnecessary, and that traveling for business may not be as valuable — or essential — as they once thought.

As Paul Hudson, CEO of Sanofi, said, ""the one-business meeting trip will disappear.""

This feature is part of a series based on conversations with more than 200 CEOs on how business will be transformed by the coronavirus. To read more, click here.

As the global pandemic upends business, CEOs are figuring out what practices they need to keep — and what they can lose for good.

From scaling back on their real estate to rethinking remote work, mandated social distancing has forced leaders to confront the idea that what used to be the professional norm may no longer be the best way to continue. That includes taking a hard look at business trips and questioning when they're really worth taking.

As the pandemic shut down airlines and hotels and brought travel to a halt, the $1 trillion business travel sector took a massive hit. According to data compiled by Tourism Economics for the US Travel Association, travel spending was down by $119 billion for the period between March 1 and April 25, a decrease of more than 80% over the same period in 2019.

About 30% of total travel spending in 2019 was for business travel, accounting for about $334.2 billion in spending and about 2.5 million jobs, according to the US Travel Association. Business travel is typically also the biggest revenue generator for the hotel industry, and conventions and other meetings being pushed out into 2021 is a growing concern.

Travel industry experts have been predicting that after the outbreak eases in the US, vacations will return well before business travel does.

Business Insider recently asked more than 200 chief executive officers at some of the world's largest companies how business will be transformed by the coronavirus.

Many of these leaders noted that the pandemic has already caused their stance on in-person meetings to evolve.

""I think we're seeing that you can do a lot [via] video conferencing, and that's going to have a big impact on how often people travel for work,"" Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky told Business Insider. ""Business travel isn't going to go away, but I think it's going to look very different in the future.""

""It may be the case that we can do less travel, but we can get more done, that we're more thoughtful about what the live meetings need to be,"" said Doug Ingram, CEO of Sarepta Therapeutics, a medical research company based in Massachusetts.

The end of the one-meeting business trip

Donna Imperato, CEO of PR and communications firm BCW Global, told Business Insider that the company recently completed a pitch that was drawn out over the course of months and involved employees traveling all over the world.

In retrospect and in regards to all the travel involved, she said, ""I don't think it was necessary to spend all that time to get the same outcome.""

Imperato isn't the only leader rethinking how prominent a role business travel needs to play in future operations.

The coronavirus pandemic has forced a shift to remote work that had already been in progress for several years. And, businesses that have implemented the infrastructure for remote work in response to the pandemic may realize that that setup works for them just fine.

Some executives speaking with Business Insider said they were surprised to find that going remote has actually made their workforce more productive, perhaps because they are doing less networking and person-to-person interacting.

""Paradoxically, the crisis has significantly improved the way we operate and made us more efficient with no lunches, dinners, or traveling,"" Sir Martin Sorrell, chairman of S4 Capital, a media company based in London, said. Sorrell is also the founder and former CEO of advertising giant WPP.

This shift in mindset will likely mean that many business leaders will take a more discerning approach when scheduling trips.

""Undoubtedly, the experiments we're all going through by using video conferencing, FaceTime facilities for quick meetings a quick exchange of ideas has certainly changed significantly our behavior,"" Thomas Flohr, CEO of private jet company VistaJet, told Business Insider. ""So in the short-term, I don't see travel [is going] to rebound anywhere in the near future.""

Paul Hudson, CEO of Sanofi, a pharmaceutical company that's headquartered in New Jersey and employs more than 100,000 people globally, said that ""the one-business meeting trip will disappear.""

""People will be more comfortable with virtual meeting solutions and travel will become something we do when it's absolutely necessary,"" he said.

Embracing alternatives — for now

Several leaders said it would take a viable vaccine for this to change.

""We'll continue to rely on technology and new thinking to perform our jobs,"" Dave Burwick, CEO of The Boston Beer Company, said. ""And at least until there's a vaccine, we expect to be traveling less on planes and not interacting with large groups of people.""

Until then, business leaders are embracing virtual meetings and conferences.

""There will still be times when the industry will need to come together in person. I look forward to the day when there is a vaccine so that will be possible,"" Terry Duffy, chairman and CEO of CME Group, said. ""In the meantime, we will need to be more creative, rethinking old ways of doing business and developing new ones that fit this new reality.""

Business travel will look different once it resumes

Hilton is developing new hygiene protocols, including placing a seal on doors to indicate that no one has entered since it was last cleaned. Hilton

Hotels and other hospitality branches catering to business travelers will likely have to implement additional hygiene measures as they start to welcome people back.

55% of the business travelers surveyed by Engagious said that visible medical screenings like temperature checks and swabs before entering a venue would have a positive impact on their willingness to resume visits to places like airports, hotels, and restaurants.

Hospitality businesses are gearing up for this shift in mentality, rolling out enhanced cleaning protocols and social distancing measures. As Chris Nassetta, president and CEO of Hilton, told Business Insider, hotels will endure as gathering points for a variety of events, including business meetings, ""though likely with some adjustments.""

""As wedding receptions, business meetings, and social gatherings return, the way our Team Members deliver food and beverage service will also change,"" Nassetta said. ""We can expect the demand for buffet and communal dining to change, and the opportunity for personalized, one-on-one service to increase.""

Ultimately, it's likely to be years before business travel returns to the levels set in 2019, if it ever does.

Gary Kelly, CEO of Southwest Airlines, said in an April earnings call that business travel could take more than five years to return to levels from last year. Business travel makes up about a third of Southwest's passenger traffic, he said.

""Based on history, in a recessionary environment, it is a long recovery period for businesses. And it's intuitive to me on why that would be,"" he said. ""This one feels like it could be worse.""",real

A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump’s measures of success. But after a manic 3½ years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.

By far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. “I’m not going to play that game,” said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. “I think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they’re not uniform across states and across countries.”

But even beyond the death count, there’s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. “I’m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,” the official said.

Some Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn’t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn’t been able to focus on getting the response right.

Trump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. “So it is a war and I define victory when it’s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,” he said on May 1. “It can never be a total victory because too many people have died.”

When American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn’t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush’s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.

Others are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. “Allowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,” argued one Republican close to the president.

“The closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.” Sen. Lindsey Graham

But, he added, “If things don’t look like they’re bouncing back by September, I think that’s going to be a problem.”

The fear that Trump can’t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.

When asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump’s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the “economic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.”

A spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.

Others are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)",real

On Monday, the Canadian singer shared a video to Instagram of him playing guitar and singing “Cuts Like a Knife” accompanied with a caption sarcastically thanking the “bat eating, wet market animal selling, virus making greedy (expletives)” for starting the pandemic.

“The whole world is now on hold, not to mention the thousands that have suffered or died from this virus. My message to them other than ‘thanks a (expletive) lot’ is go vegan,” Adams wrote. “To all the people missing out on our shows, I wish I could be there more than you know. It’s been great hanging out in isolation with my children and family, but I miss my other family, my band, my crew and my fans.”

The note prompted social media outcry, with some posters accusing Adams of racism. On Tuesday, Adams issued a statement on Instagram in the same fashion: He shared a video singing “Into the Fire,” alongside a caption apologizing for his previous post.

“Apologies to any and all that took offence to my posting yesterday. No excuse, I just wanted to have a rant about the horrible animal cruelty in these wet-markets being the possible source of the virus, and promote veganism,” Adams wrote. “I have love for all people and my thoughts are with everyone dealing with this pandemic around the world.”

Adams isn’t the first classic rocker to call out wet markets in response to the coronavirus and call for veganism.

Speaking with NME in an interview published in April, Queen’s Brian May said he thinks a vegan diet would be better for people’s overall health.

“If you want to get deep into it, I think we should be looking again at whether we should be eating animals,” Queen’s co-founder said. “That’s a central issue here, this pandemic seemed to come from people eating animals and it’s becoming more well known that eating animals is not the greatest thing for our health.”

The consensus among researchers studying the spread of the virus pinpoints COVID-19’s likely origin to a “wet market” in Wuhan, China, where live and dead creatures including bats are sold as food and for alleged medicinal purposes. Though experts have not ruled out the possibility that the pathogen could have been brought to the market by an already infected person, there is no evidence to suggest COVID-19 originated outside the country.

The publications pointed at open data showing increased mortality in Moscow and St. Petersburg last month compared to previous Aprils.

The Russian Foreign Ministry attacked the newspapers on Thursday, accusing them of ""disinformation,"" and demanding retractions. Russian lawmaker Vasily Piskaryov also demanded the publications be stripped of their press accreditation.

Vice president for communications for The New York Times, Danielle Rhoades Ha, said in a statement obtained by CBS News that the newspaper's report was accurate because it was based on ""publicly available government records and interviews with experts from government-run institutions.""

Russia has the second highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the world after the United States, with more than 262,000 confirmed cases reported as of Friday. The country's official death toll, however, remains lower compared to other hard-hit countries: 2,418 COVID-19 deaths have been reported by Russian officials.

According to government data, Moscow registered over 1,700 more deaths overall last month compared to its April average over the past five years. The New York Times pointed out that that total is much higher than Russia's official coronavirus death count of 642 in Moscow for April.

The Financial Times reported a similar spike in total deaths reported in St. Petersburg in April, suggesting that the country could have 70% more coronavirus deaths than officially stated.

Neither publications have met the foreign ministry's demand for a retraction.

Moscow's Health Department reacted to the press reports on Wednesday with a statement saying that more than 60% of deaths among the city's coronavirus patients are not being included in the official virus death toll because their deaths resulted from underlying causes. Officials said autopsies are being conducted in all suspected coronavirus deaths, and defended their methodology as ""exceptionally precise.""

Russian officials have also claimed that the large scope of testing contributed to low mortality, allowing the detection of infections at early stages. According to the Russian healthcare watchdog, Rospotrebnadzor, 6.4 million COVID-19 tests have been done as of Friday.",real

Michigan residents on alert as Midland could be under 9 feet of water

Urging residents to evacuate and warning that downtown Midland could be under 9 feet of water by Wednesday afternoon, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency after the Edenville and Sanford dams breached. Several dams upstream of Midland along the Tittabawassee had either been breached or were releasing water uncontrollably after 4 to 7 inches of rain fell Sunday and Monday, including the Edenville and Sanford dams, forcing the evacuation of thousands of people in mid-Michigan. ""Please do not hesitate. Go to stay with a friend or relative or go to one of these shelters now,"" Whitmer warned, adding that even at a shelter, people should try to do the best they can to practice social distancing and wear a face covering to protect themselves and others from the coronavirus.

A new bill has been introduced into the 116th Congress (2019-2020) of the U.S. House of Representatives named H.R.6666 - COVID-19 Testing, Reaching, And Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act, with the potential to further the loss of the already vanishing health freedoms of each and every citizen of the United States. You can stand with us today by opposing H.R.6666 now (use this link to Take A Stand)

H.R. 6666, despite having been introduced by Rep. Bobby L. Rush [D-IL-1] and referred to the Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on the same day almost two weeks ago on 5/01/2020, has received little mainstream media coverage to this date, other than recent attempts to debunk claims that it would further violate the rights of Americans. As of 5/14/2020 is has 59 co-sponsors, including one Republican, indicating the potential that it may gain greater bipartisan support unless strongly opposed.

H.R. 6666 authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Director of the CDC, to allocate a 100 billion dollars, annually (or until the national COVID emergency is declared over), to employ, train, and deploy an immense workforce of “testing and contact tracers” to be sent directly to everyone’s homes for diagnostic testing and tracing of contacts suspected to have been infected or are at risk of infection with COVID-19. The bill uses broad yet highly vague language to describe the role of this veritable army of new agents of the emerging U.S. medical police state “for other purposes,” such as “support the quarantine of such contacts.”

The nebulous language of H.R. 6666 affords the government and public and private grantees under its coordination unusually broad discretion to apply its newly granted police powers under the presently defined “national COVID health emergency.” Since the national lockdown began on March the 15th, we’ve witnessed the near complete suspension of most of our Constitutionally irrevocable civil liberties, with the near complete cessation and/or modification of all socio-economic activity within the country. Moreover, executive orders have already been enacted throughout this country enabling the forced seizure of body tissue and fluids, property, forced vaccination, testing, isolation, quarantine and arrest without due process. While not all of these draconian regulations have yet been implemented en masse, they exist in the letter of the law and therefore could be enforced, especially given that bills such as H.R.6666 use broad discretionary language leaving it to the government to intepret its meaning and apply force as it sees fit. If H.R. 6666 passes, real ""teeth"" would be put to many of the laws, acts, orders, and regulations that have been passed as executive orders over the past two months, potentially locking the entire country into an irreversible control grid the likes of which we have not seen outside of countries like China.

In light of this, H.R. 6666 may be setting the stage for the implementation of what WHO director Dr. Mike Ryan of the WHO and Ventura County California officials, say will include forcibly removing family members found positive or suspected of being infected. The only way to prevent this is to make sure the bill is opposed and dies.

Eligible recipients of funds include “faith-based” and “school-based” institutions, implying that these organizations might also become, in part, testing or treatment centers.

What is Contract Tracing?

Take a few minutes to watch the important reports by independent journalists Spyro Skouras and James Corbett on the contact tracing agenda in the rapidly unfolding story of coronavirus.

Contract tracing, which on the surface appears to mitigate the risk of disease spread by identifying carriers and interfering their further contact with the healthy, is based on a series of flawed assumptions:

The disease known as COVID-19 and believed to be caused by a singular infectious disease entity, i.e. the viral particle known as SARS-CoV-2, has never been validated through Koch postulates to be inducible and solely caused by SARS-CoV-2 within a controlled clinical or experimental setting. Over 100 different types of coronavirus have already been identified in circulation naturally around the world, and there is serious doubt that we can adequately distinguish between natural extracellular vesicles such as human exosomes and novel or endogenous forms of coronovirus already present in the human virome with the tests being used today, namely, RT-PCR. Learn more about this at www.questioningcovid.com That so-called “positive cases” identified through any number of over 100 different PCR-based and antibody-testing methods are accurate indicators of the presence of COVID-19, or do not generate false positives. If false positives are not accounted for, contract tracing can cause or contribute to a falsely expanding epidemic and those who are unnecessarily quarantined and treated will succumb to greatly elevated iatrogenically induced morbidity and mortality risks, which will never be discovered because the so-called “confirmed case fatality rates for COVID-19” require no viral testing, and only “suspicion of infection.” This is because the WHO and US Vital Statistics agencies explicitly advise against confirming these suspicion-based deaths through viral testing and other clinical means, in an egregious departure from both science and evidence-based medicine.

If contact tracing is fraught with technical inadequacies, why would it be so aggressively implemented nationwide? One reason is that it provides a justification for total spectrum dominance via real-time surveillance and control of the entire population under the auspices of “public health safety,” into perpetuity. In essence, it is like a new “war on terror,” but with the enemy being defined as our own bodies, or contact between bodies, and the solution the complete removal of any privacy, nor right to exempt oneself or children from medical mandates. The system would likely include tracking GPS data of mobile device users and then following back their contacts to identify, test, isolate, quarantine, medicate, or otherwise vaccinate them when one becomes available most likely in the fall of 2020. The media has already fomented profound fear through misreporting, misrepresenting, and catastrophizing case fatality projections, over the past few months. Their egregious disregard for the truth has lead to socioenomic and psychobiological impacts that are arguably orders of magnitude more harmful and deadly than this, or any other virus believed to contribute to flu-like illness. Clearly, the media and power that be could re-manufacture another crisis, or “second” or “third” wave simply be repeating what they have already one (learn more on the topic via the Corbett Report). At which point, with an army of contact tracers, testers, quarantine enforcers, and medicators and vaccinators, the systems being funded by H.R. 6666 would be ready to further this agenda.

So, why does H.R. 6666 refrain from providing even the most rudimentary details to how one of the largest and most widespread in impact bills ever introduced will impact those affected? The more vague and broad the language, the less oversight. The truth is that the detailed plans for how H.R.666 will be implemented were already written and revealed to the public a month ago by the Rockefeller Foundation in a 30-page plan titled, “NATIONAL COVID-19 TESTING ACTION PLAN:Pragmatic steps to reopen our workplaces and our communities.” Not coincidentally, the plan proposed the exact same dollar figure was required - 100 billion dollars -- and suggested that between 100-300,000 contract tracers would be needed.

The giant coronavirus stimulus legislation signed into law Friday provides federal money for the state to provide extra and extended unemployment benefits.

The Department of Employment Security has not yet revised its website to reflect how newly eligible people can apply for the new federally funded assistance, with state officials still working out the details.

Gov. J.B. Pritzker said at a briefing Saturday a “deluge” of applications for unemployment continue to flood the department.

Under the new federal law, funding will flow to states to help cover gig workers newly eligible for unemployment compensation; 13 weeks of extra payments will be added to the 26 already allowed and, according to Section 2104 of the legislation, there will also be an “emergency increase in unemployment compensation” of “an additional $600 per week payment to each recipient of unemployment insurance or Pandemic Unemployment Assistance for up to four months. “

Tens of thousands of workers across Illinois have been temporarily out of work since the outbreak began forcing businesses to close. Last week, Pritzker ordered all bars and restaurants to stop serving dine-in customers, and on Saturday, he issued a stay-at-home order leaving just “essential” businesses in operation.

A message to our readers We’re keeping essential coronavirus news that you need to know accessible for free here at suntimes.com. This public service is yet another example of the importance of quality local journalism, so please consider supporting us through a digital subscription. Subscribe

The result is countless people are now out of work and being forced into the state’s unemployment system. Illinois alone saw more than 64,000 new claims for unemployment benefits from March 16-18, and an unprecedented 130,000-plus claims so far this month, officials said.

To handle this massive influx of new applications, IDES announced it recently adopted emergency rules for who qualifies for unemployment insurance.

Unemployment insurance (UI) basics

In normal times, UI provides temporary income via federal funds to Illinois residents who are unemployed but able, available and actively seeking work each week.

The amount residents can receive depends on their usual pay rate with benefits ranging from $51 to $580 per week. Those approved can receive up to 26 weeks of benefits in a 12-month period.

The new emergency rules adopted during the coronavirus pandemic open up UI to a much larger group of workers. This means many people who wouldn’t typically qualify for UI can get benefits during the state of emergency.

Additionally, under the federal relief bill passed last week, Illinois residents receiving unemployment benefits will receive an additional $600 weekly above what they would receive in regular unemployment benefits until July 31, 2020.

Workers temporarily laid off due to COVID-19 can get UI

Illinois residents who are temporarily out of work because their employer has closed due to the coronavirus can qualify for UI if they meet all the other basic requirements.

The state isn’t expecting anyone to go out looking for a new job during a stay-at-home order: as long as applicants are prepared to return to their job as soon as the employer reopens, they’ll be considered to be actively seeking work and will qualify.

Under emergency rules, these workers will not have to register with the employment service.

Workers who quit due to COVID-19 fears cannot get UI

Unlike Illinois residents who are temporarily laid off by their employers’ closure, workers who voluntarily leave their job over concerns of the coronavirus will not be eligible for UI. The agency says “an individual generally has a duty to make a reasonable effort to work with his or her employer to resolve whatever issues have caused the individual to consider quitting.”

Parents who leave work due to a child’s school closure can get UI

With all Illinois schools closed through at least the end of April, and possibly the remainder of the school year, parents who voluntarily leave work to care for their child can qualify for UI because they “could be considered as unemployed through no fault of” their own.

You must still meet all of the other standard requirements, and unlike workers temporarily laid off due to COVID-19, parents who voluntarily leave work must be registered with the employment service.

Anyone who’s already exhausted UI rights may be eligible for additional benefits

With the passing of the federal relief bill in Congress last week, IDES announced Tuesday that some individuals who have already received their full 26 weeks of regular unemployment benefits in the last one-year period will be eligible for additional benefits during the crisis.

“If you have exhausted your benefits, or you are close to exhausting your benefits, we are finalizing the process to continue benefits under the stimulus package,” IDES said in a Q-and-A posted on its website. The agency says more information will be issued once guidance is provided by the U.S. Department of Labor.

Here’s how to apply for UI

You can call the Illinois Department of Economic Services at (800) 244-5631 or 866-488-4016 (TTY), but users are urged to file claims via the IDES website. And do not go in person: as of March 19, IDES offices are closed to the public until further notice.

To accommodate the massive surge of applicants, the agency has staggered times for people to submit claims:

People whose last names start with the letters A through M are asked to file claims online on Sundays, Tuesdays or Thursdays.

Last names beginning with N through Z should file claims on Mondays, Wednesdays or Fridays.

Saturdays are set aside for people who aren’t able to file during their allotted time, officials said.

People without internet access should call in according to the following schedule, per IDES:",real

The ride-hailing giant announced the new feature called ""Family Style Meals"" on Wednesday. It's located in the Uber Eats app and features meals meant for sharing.

Some participating restaurants will offer a curated menu that lists a combination of items offering value and savings, the company said. Others will focus primarily on larger portions that can feed multiple members of your family.

""We know that these are tough times for families, whether they rely on school meals to feed their children or are dealing with the pressures of working from home and cooking three meals a day,"" said Kalyan Kuchimanchi, director of regional operations for the U.S. and Canada at Uber Eats.

Family Meals is launching in select markets to start. Suburbs surrounding New York City, Los Angeles, Atlanta and Miami are among the first to get the update. San Francisco, Washington, Dallas, Boston, and Houston, as well as Connecticut and New Jersey will follow and a full rollout across the country is expected by June.

Also part of Uber's announcement is a free ride donation to local school districts and youth organizations to pass out to food-insecure families. The donation of 100,000 rides is part of a broader 10 million free ride-commitment during the pandemic.

The move comes at a time when millions of Americans have been laid off and had their household income slashed due to the coronavirus fallout. The situation is particularly dire for people with low-wage jobs that cannot be performed at home.

Nearly 37 million Americans were food insecure in 2018. That number could rise by 17.1 million in the wake of the pandemic, according to Feeding America.

Dr. Andrew Kaufman may be the most censored doctor in the U.S. right now. His videos are removed and censored from YouTube very quickly.

Dr. Kaufman is so intelligent, and so articulate, that the “mainstream” media and medical authorities obviously fear him and his message, and they are doing everything in their power to suppress him.

This video (below) he did with Spiro Skouras, for example, was immediately removed from YouTube, although Spiro’s other videos remain for the most part (for now).

Andrew Kaufman is a medical doctor. Here is his full bio from his website:

In this interview with Spiro Skouras, you will most likely learn things you have never heard before about the COVID-19 pandemic. Dr. Kaufman will explain why this is all planned, and is not really about a dangerous virus at all, but a way to control people’s lives.

He will explain things about the new type of vaccine they are rushing so fast to develop, and what he believes is the real objective for this vaccine.

Dr. Kaufman has already paid a steep price to be a whistle blower, and he only expects it to get worse. He states:

This is the only important thing for me to do now, is to get this information out, so that we can prevent ourselves from living in a horrible, horrible future. I have two young children, and they are my main motivating factor, that I don’t want them to live in a world where they have no freedom. And that’s where we’re heading right now. And so whatever risks there are, they’re risks that I simply have to take. That’s why I am doing what I am doing. There have been things that have occurred. I have had consequences. I was let go from my regular psychiatry job because I refused to wear a mask. I have had several friends who are doctors or other health care professionals who have been very upset with me. (They’re) disappointed and won’t talk to me anymore. I knew that those risks were part of this. But that’s not what’s important. I’ll tell you that I would be happy to risk being taken to jail as well, because I’m not going to participate in any of these measures. I don’t wear a mask. I don’t stay at home. I respect other people’s rights to make their own choices. So I don’t go and get in people’s faces. But if anyone is willing to make eye contact and interact with me, I don’t observe any social distancing, (and so) any opportunity to hug someone, especially in public, I always take advantage of that, because I want to show people that actually all of these measures are really voluntary. Even Governor Cuomo has made a public statement that there’s nothing that they can do to enforce any of these measures and that they are voluntary. And I would like to encourage other people to make that decision, because if we rely on the authority to give us approval of how to exercise our freedom, they’re going to take more freedoms away, as they’ve been doing. So while I respect people that to go and protest at the City Hall or State Capital, they are coming from the right point of view, they’re just asking the authority figures, the government, to give them permission, when they don’t need permission from the government. They already have permission because they have inalienable rights. It’s not really a decision for me. It’s just what I feel that I have to do to preserve the way of life that I want to live for me and my children.

To defeat a lethal enemy, we sacrifice freedoms, limit contact with others, surrender financial security, and restrict ourselves from things we would like to be doing, in service of the greater good of saving lives.

It strikes me that the same thing was happening around this time 57 years ago.

Opinion

On April 16, 1963 (Good Friday that year), 50 courageous individuals chose to be commanded by the government to remain in place; they did so to combat a pernicious, nation-ravaging evil that had taken countless lives and seemingly knew no borders. Led by Martin Luther King, Fred Shuttlesworth and Ralph Albernathy, these peaceful protest marchers were incarcerated by Bull Connor. They intentionally remained in jail, eschewing bond, to combat the deathly evil of racism.

From that very Birmingham Jail, Dr. King would pen his rightly famous letter. He challenged us to pay attention to what his moment made clear, bringing to the surface the problems already present.

“We bring [racism] out in the open, where it can be seen and dealt with. … Injustice must be exposed, with all the tension its exposure creates, to the light of human conscience and the air of national opinion before it can be cured.”

Dr. King taught us that racism must be exposed. In the age of COVID-19, racism certainly has been exposed as a stubbornly infectious and lethal American virus. Racism is combining with the coronavirus to double the damage inflicted upon African Americans.

We learned last week that people of color are dying disproportionately of the novel coronavirus. While some sing the chorus “the virus knows no color”, African Americans are dying of the disease at alarming rates: people of color constitute 42% of COVID fatalities, but only 21% of the national population. Here in Chicago, the statistics are more stark: 70% of coronavirus deaths have found victims in our African American community.

The injustice has been exposed is that both COVID-19 and racism are killing the black community in Chicago and throughout America. This is not the bias of petty personal prejudice, but racism entrenched in American institutions: the legacy of intentional racist policies that led to tragic disproportions in housing, educational opportunities, food availability, employment prospects, and wealth generation.

Racism kills. It killed through the master’s whip. It killed through lynchings. It killed through the KKK. It kills through mass incarceration, with Cook County Jail serving as the worst current example. But racism also kills through the continuing effects of centuries of American policy that are every bit as lethal.

Yes, we are seeing death by COVID-19. But we are also witnessing death by racism. And through our history, racism has a much higher and even more tragic body count.

Fifthy-seven years ago, Dr. King did more than shelter-in-place to combat racism; he went to jail.

I imagine Dr. King might be encouraged to see all we are sacrificing to counter COVID-19. But I know he would also challenge us with this question: if we are willing to sacrifice to fight one deadly disease, what will America muster finally to combat the lethal virus of racism?

Americans have proven this month that, even without strong centralized leadership, we can unite to combat a pernicious killer. We can combine individual effort with state leadership and unprecedented federal investment to overcome a menacing threat.

Once we defeat the coronavirus, the time has come — and the road map has been drawn — for us as a nation finally to defeat the plague of racism.

In early February, China's ruling Communist Party was facing one of its biggest political crises in more than three decades. A rapidly spreading outbreak of the new coronavirus was a ""massive risk and challenge"" to social stability, Chinese President Xi Jinping warned top party officials in an internal speech that was later published publicly.

But with new domestic infections near zero, China has claimed victory over a virus that much of the world is still struggling to curtail. Newly confident and sensitive to criticisms that it initially covered up the outbreak, China's leadership is now seeking to recast the pandemic as a political win by arguing that its centralized, top-down governance system made it uniquely well-suited for containing and managing the virus; according to official figures, the virus has claimed fewer than 5,000 Chinese lives.

""The way the Chinese handled the coronavirus is coupled with technology, with culture and with very effective government coordination,"" said Wang Huiyao, president of the Beijing-based think tank Center for China and Globalization. ""That's something unthinkable in Western countries.""

Emboldened, China has also taken a bellicose, sometimes-threatening approach to countries that are critical of its response to the coronavirus. China has pressured European Union officials to tone down or outright remove language describing disinformation that Beijing put out during the pandemic — a story The New York Times first reported. On Twitter, Chinese diplomats have lashed out at those criticizing China's handling of the pandemic.

China has been especially aggressive in countering a narrative pushed forth with no evidence by senior U.S. officials, including President Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, that the virus originated — perhaps accidentally — in a laboratory in the Chinese city of Wuhan. Scientists, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, the U.S. government's top infectious disease specialist, say the novel coronavirus probably developed in nature. ""The sole purpose for some U.S. politicians trying to fool others with their obvious lies is to shift the blame of their own incompetence,"" a Foreign Ministry spokesman said last month. China's state broadcaster recently released a satirical cartoon video depicting Lego characters representing China and the U.S., with America's Statue of Liberty making contradictory statements and throwing insults as China's mask-wearing terra cotta warrior patiently explains.

YouTube

""One of the most striking elements of Chinese diplomacy at this particular time is just how undiplomatic it's been,"" said Elizabeth Economy, Asia director at the Council on Foreign Relations.

When Australia joined the U.S. in demanding an investigation into the origins of the virus in China, Hu Xijin, the outspoken editor-in-chief of the Global Times state tabloid, likened Australia to ""chewing gum stuck on the sole of China's shoes. Sometimes you have to find a stone to rub it off."" ""You do not know how aggressive, how unreasonable the West can be in making up their fictions,"" Hu told NPR.

A colorful provocateur who supports his country's more aggressive diplomacy, Hu justified China's more hawkish behavior as a natural response to American aggression. ""China is getting better and better, while the future success of the U.S. is not assured,"" said Hu. ""When the U.S. continually attacks China, mocks China, can you expect us to say nothing?""

While striking a more combative tone may have found support among its own more nationalistic citizenry, Beijing may not have expected the global backlash it is now encountering.

Faulty Chinese medical products, including face masks, have led some European countries to reject medical donations from China. Racism against thousands of Africans living in China's southern city of Guangzhou has wiped out much of the goodwill Beijing built up on the African continent. Several American lawmakers have argued that the U.S. should waive China's sovereign legal immunity; that would allow at least two states suing China for damages from the coronavirus to proceed to court.

China has shifted blame by accusing the U.S. military, without providing evidence, of first bringing the virus to Wuhan when it competed in sports games last October. The claim has gained traction on the mainland.

Zhao Lijian, a Foreign Ministry spokesperson known for his bellicose Twitter presence, has suggested several times that the coronavirus did not originate in China. State media outlets have repeatedly accused the U.S. of downplaying the severity of its outbreak.

""We think Americans came to the Wuhan seafood market in October when there were military sports games being held in Wuhan,"" said one former vendor at the Wuhan market where the first cluster of human coronavirus cases was reported. The seller would not use his name because he wants to open a new store and does not want to be associated with the market. ""The Americans are behind it all,"" he said.

Behind China's hostile rhetoric is a strong sense of aggrievement that other countries have overlooked its role in containing the coronavirus pandemic.

""People in China feel a sense of pride because they had to sacrifice and that the leadership in the [Chinese Communist] party led them in an effective way,"" said Susan Shirk, a former deputy assistant secretary of state who's now chair of the 21st Century China Center at the University of California, San Diego.

Others sense a more nefarious purpose behind the China bashing. ""The ultimate purpose behind fanning the flames for racial discrimination and assigning responsibility is to demonize China and suppress China's rise,"" wrote Lin Yueqin, a scholar at the state-run Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, in April.

Ultimately, what may be driving Chinese leaders' strident messaging is less a desire to impress other countries and more one to reassure its own citizens that China is standing up to American criticism.

""Either the Chinese diplomats are delusional, or they are simply doing their very best to prevent the international narrative from seeping into domestic Chinese discourse and undermining the legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party. And I would wager that the second is probably more likely than the first,"" said Economy, of the Council on Foreign Relations.

While assigning blame might score points with populist elements in both China and the U.S., it comes at a cost for an important geopolitical relationship.

""The epidemic at home was a real domestic crisis for the party leadership, and I think they've gone into overdrive to shore up domestic support,"" said Shirk, who is writing a book titled Overreach, about Chinese politics and diplomacy. ""But what's happened is they're overdoing it in a way that's causing this international backlash against them. So it's very counterproductive.""

Instead of collaborating on a global health crisis, the two countries are now even further apart, according to U.S.-China relations experts.

""The situation has decayed so much that to turn things around now and restore the level of international trust that China had previously enjoyed is all but impossible. It would be a challenge for even the most talented, cultivated and practiced diplomats,"" Zi Zhongyun, a widely respected scholar of U.S.-China relations at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, wrote in late April.

The voices of reason are increasingly being censored and silenced in China, leaving only those at the extremes of the political spectrum, Zi lamented.

Sorrento Therapeutics skyrocketed as much as 244% on Friday after the company said an antibody it was developing showed ""100% inhibition"" of the COVID-19 virus in preclinical studies.

The small biotechnology company said it planned to ""generate an antibody cocktail product that would act as a 'protective shield' against SARS-CoV-2,"" the official name of the novel coronavirus.

Sorrento said it would ask regulators for ""priority evaluation and accelerated review"" of its antibody candidate. The company added that it hoped to receive government support and partner with a pharmaceutical company to scale up manufacturing of its candidate if clinical studies find it to be successful.

A high-ranking federal scientist focused on vaccine development says he was removed from his post because of his ""insistence"" that the government spend funds on ""safe and scientifically vetted solutions"" to address the coronavirus crisis and not on ""drugs, vaccines and other technologies that lack scientific merit.""

In a statement Wednesday that was released by his attorneys, Richard Bright specifically cited his pushback against unproven potential treatments that President Trump has repeatedly advocated for during White House briefings and on Twitter.

Bright was director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority and a deputy assistant secretary with the Department of Health and Human Services until, he says, he was removed on Tuesday. Bright said he has been transferred to ""a more limited and less impactful position"" at the National Institutes of Health.

Asked about the removal during Wednesday evening's coronavirus briefing, Trump said he'd never heard of Bright. ""Maybe he was [removed after raising concerns], maybe he wasn't,"" Trump said. ""You'd have to hear the other side.""

In an emailed statement, Caitlin Oakley, an HHS spokeswoman, said: ""As it relates to chloroquine, it was Dr. Bright who requested an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for donations of chloroquine that Bayer and Sandoz recently made to the Strategic National Stockpile for use on COVID-19 patients.""

Bright said his career in vaccine development has prepared him for a crisis like this one. ""To this point, I have led the government's efforts to invest in the best science available to combat the COVID-19 pandemic,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, this resulted in clashes with HHS political leadership, including criticism for my proactive efforts to invest early in vaccines and supplies critical to saving American lives. I also resisted efforts to fund potentially dangerous drugs promoted by those with political connections.""

He added: ""Specifically, and contrary to misguided directives, I limited the broad use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, promoted by the administration as a panacea, but which clearly lack scientific merit.""

The president suggested last month on Twitter that taking a combination of hydroxychloroquine — which is used to treat lupus and to prevent malaria — and azithromycin could be ""one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine.""

He has also repeated a line about patients suffering from the coronavirus who are inquiring about taking hydroxychloroquine: ""What do you have to lose?""

As NPR reported Tuesday, a panel of experts convened by the NIH recommended against doctors using a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin for the treatment of COVID-19, because of potential toxicities.

As for using hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine alone, the panel said there was ""insufficient clinical data to recommend either for or against.""

In fact, Dr. Anthony Fauci, of the NIH and a member of the White House's coronavirus task force, said last month that hydroxychloroquine was not considered a treatment for the coronavirus.

Bright said in his statement that he is ""speaking out because to combat this deadly virus, science – not politics or cronyism – has to lead the way."" He said he will request the HHS' inspector general to ""investigate the manner in which this Administration has politicized the work of BARDA and has pressured me and other conscientious scientists to fund companies with political connections as well as efforts that lack scientific merit.""

Bright's attorneys, Debra Katz and Lisa Banks, added that they are seeking a stay of his termination. The attorneys have also represented several high-profile whistleblowers and #MeToo accusers, including Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.

The New York Times, which first reported Bright's statement, said he had led BARDA since 2016. The online health publication STAT first reported he was no longer leading the agency on Tuesday.",real

Over the weekend, the Food and Drug Administration granted two malaria drugs ""emergency use authorization"" for the treatment of COVID-19. The move makes it easier to add the medicines to the strategic stockpile, which can be drawn upon in the current public health emergency.

The drugs — chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine — have been identified as potential COVID-19 treatments based on lab tests and small, limited studies in humans.

But gold standard clinical trials in the United States only just got underway. Preliminary results from those studies aren't expected for weeks or months.

One thing is for sure, the FDA decision doesn't reflect an official determination that the drugs work against the coronavirus.

""This is not FDA approval of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19,"" says infectious diseases physician Rajesh Gandhi, who is leading Massachusetts General Hospital's COVID-19 treatment task force. ""There's an epidemic of misinformation out there, and we need to combat that.""

The emergency use authorization only applies to the supply of these two drugs in the Strategic National Stockpile, the government's storehouses of emergency medical supplies located in warehouses throughout the country.

Hospitals would need to request access to the drugs through their states, and the medicines would only be distributed to patients who have been hospitalized and tested positive for COVID-19, but for whom a ""clinical trial is not available, or participation is not feasible,"" according to the FDA.

""It's nice to know that they have it in the event we're running low or going to run out,"" says Onisis Stefas, chief pharmacy officer at Northwell Health in New York, where doctors are already using the drug for patients who can't be enrolled in clinical trials. ""It's good to have this as backup.""

The emergency use authorization won't affect patients seeking this drug from their local pharmacies, where shortages have been reported.

Sandoz, the generic and biosimilar arm of drugmaker Novartis, donated 30 million doses of hydroxychloroquine to the stockpile. Bayer Pharmaceuticals donated 1 million doses of chloroquine. The Department of Health and Human Services announced on Sunday that it accepted these doses ""for possible use in treating patients hospitalized with COVID-19 or for use in clinical trials.""

President Trump began promoting both drugs at his daily coronavirus press briefings earlier this month, prompting a spike in hydroxychloroquine prescriptions and concern about shortages and accidental poisonings.

If the drugs were helpful, doctors would be pleased to have a treatment option.

""We were told patients with COVID-19 who received this drug cleared the virus better than patients that did not receive the drug,"" says Francois Nosten, who directs the Shoklo Malaria Research Unit in Thailand and has been working with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for decades. ""But it's not sufficient information to be sure that this drug can be used or should be used in treating patients more widely.""

Preliminary findings often don't pan out.

""The whole history of infectious disease is littered with drugs we all thought were going to be promising but turned out ... not to be,"" Mass General's Gandhi says, adding that some of these medicines even turned out to be harmful.",real
565,https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2020/05/remote-career-technical-school-covid-19-pandemic/611047/,2020-05-02,"Shop Class, Over Zoom","CTE is one of the few areas of public education that has consistent bipartisan support among federal lawmakers, and it’s also favored by the public in national education polls. Massachusetts is one of a growing number of states boosting its investment in CTE: In recent years, it has distributed more than $78 million in grants to help expand CTE programs, including more classroom seats to accommodate students training for high-demand jobs.

The district has the resources for Essex Tech to adapt relatively quickly to remote learning; the school provided students with laptops or iPads at the start of the academic year, and administrators say they’ve been able to help families in need get access to mobile hotspots for internet service. The school’s leadership team also put together a thorough blueprint detailing processes and expectations for students and staff while distance learning is the norm, something teachers and parents say has eased the transition.

Not every CTE school will have the same supports to fall back on, Jarrod Nagurka, a spokesperson for the national Association for Career and Technical Education, told me. But CTE’s emphasis on creative problem-solving could help students and teachers adjust more swiftly to this new reality, Nagurka said. “We’re seeing an incredible amount of resourcefulness,” he said.

That’s been the case for Massachusetts’s CTE community more widely, which has responded rapidly to the remote-learning situation, Kevin Farr, the executive director of the Massachusetts Association of Vocational Administrators, told me. Teachers from the state’s 56 vocational programs are sharing lessons, video lectures, and ideas for activities. “We’re going to provide a solid bank of online resources from all over the country, as well as the state,” Farr said. “We have to fill that gap until we can get our kids back to school, and back to the hands-on piece.”

In the meantime, being forced to adapt to distance learning means that schools such as Essex Tech have a chance to reimagine how CTE is taught, which could be a boon for communities where the cost of building and outfitting specialized schools is an issue or for rural areas where in-person classes aren’t possible. “Necessity does breed invention, and this situation we’re all facing certainly qualifies as necessity,” Robin Lake, the director of the Center on Reinventing Public Education at the University of Washington, told me. “We’re very eager to watch what kinds of solutions people come up with and what kind of evidence we can collect to see which approaches work better than others.”

For Benouardia, the Essex Tech freshman, the forced transition to remote learning has been both challenging and rewarding. Her classroom is now the two-story house that she shares with her parents, three siblings, and grandmother. The family’s internet service has slowed down considerably with more people at home, and for some classes the workload is heavier than when school was open. There have been perks, too, such as setting her own schedule, and assignments like the litter survey. “That was the best homework I’ve ever had,” Benouardia told me. “I learned a lot from it about my neighborhood and the people who live around me. That’s going to stick with me.”

Nightlife looks completely different these days.

Bar patrons have taken things into their own hands -- shaking up cocktails at home, ordering booze from an app, turning up Bluetooth speakers to listen to a virtual DJ on Instagram live, maybe even while Zooming with friends.

But can that ever fully replace elbowing up to a crowded bar, chatting up a bartender and everything else that comes with a night out?

In the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, with new social distancing requirements and ever-changing, state-by-state safety restrictions, many owners of bars and clubs are waiting with bated breath.

The coveted counter space and tables at Dante -- a famously packed, award-winning cocktail bar and restaurant in New York City -- quickly shifted to slinging specialty drinks via curbside pickup and delivery until restrictions are eased. But the staffers are taking service amid the pandemic ""one day at a time"" until they construct a plan to fully reopen.

""To be honest, none of us have any idea as to when things will really start to change,"" Linden Pride, owner of the Greenwich Village staple, told ABC News. ""This whole process has pushed us to create a full takeout and delivery menu, as well as cocktails to-go, which has taken us out of our comfort zone to create new, alternative experiences for our guests.""

Pride said he wants to continue the new experiences ""once this is all over."" He and his wife, Natalie, got the idea from a pop-up cocktail event in New Orleans, where people ""drink in a plastic cup and walk down the street."" They found thousands of stickers left over that read, ""'One for the road,' or 'a roadie' as we call it in Australia,"" Pride added.

He hailed New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo for quickly recognizing current liquor-licensing regulations that needed to be amended.

""As soon as the changes were brought into effect, which allowed cocktails to be purchased both for pick-up and delivery, with food, we saw this as an opportunity to try and keep the business operational, which would allow us to retain staff whilst continuing to provide a service to the community,"" Pride told ABC News.

Pride said, ""it's so hard to know"" definitively what service operations at Dante might look like in the future, but that he and his staff are keeping a close eye on operations in other states, including Georgia and Colorado.

""When we're allowed to open, we will adhere to CDC, WHO and state guidelines,"" Pride said, adding that he's already stocked up on thermometers to check people's temperatures at the door and that he's looking into creating disposable menus and setting up sanitizing stations, in addition to enforcing social distancing.

""One cool initiative"" he's seen at bars and restaurants in parts of Europe, ""is the extension of outdoor dining -- with some street closures."" Pride said he sees a ""real opportunity in New York"" for designated outdoor dining and drinking areas to enable places on low-traffic streets to set up ""socially distanced tables"" and serve people responsibly.

Mayor Bill de Blasio said Thursday that the possibility of restaurants and bars opening in the city's streets is ""being very thoroughly discussed"" and ""something we might be able to reach.""

""I've been talking to restaurant owners ... they're making a great case that this could be a difference-maker,"" de Blasio said. ""You have the right social distancing and protections, the right capacity ... and the right atmosphere. We have to be smart about it."" This could only come after New York City meets the city's indicators for 10 to 14 days and meets the state's indicators, which de Blasio said could be possible in the first half of June.

Pride said that with ""any kind of reopening, it doesn't mean that customers are going to flock to [bars] and fill up those seats."" Dante will look for other inventive options to recreate what Pride calls the ""ritual and experience"" of going out, like ""creating a Friday night takeaway kit"" complete with cocktails and a playlist to give customers the full experience at home.

Pride has also been in contact with close friends in the industry, including the operator of New York's PDT, and said bars and lounges that rely solely on beverages and bottle service will face ""a huge challenge because they don't have full-service kitchens.""

A standard liquor license requires nightclubs and bars to serve food in order to run a full-service beer, wine and liquor operation, according to the New York State Liquor Authority.

Eddie Dean, owner of the Brooklyn club Schimanski, has been through many ups and downs after 30 years in the nightlife business, but he's worried now about bars and clubs.

""These businesses are built on volume. A very large percentage of small bars and restaurants pretty much go week to week hoping to make payroll,"" he told ABC News. ""I imagine a high percentage of New York City-based hospitality businesses will not reopen -- or open but not be able to sustain. It's going to be ugly.""

Schimanski ""acted fast to close down"" -- perishable items cleaned out, sound equipment covered, employees furloughed. Dean now is having ""preliminary conversations"" with the landlord to ""get through this mess as best as possible.""

""So far,"" he added, ""I have not heard anything positive for clubs. Any notion of opening at 25 or 50% capacity or even 75% isn't realistic. We will do what it takes to ensure the safety of our staff and all our guests.""

Even amid the current difficulties, Dean said there have been silver linings, like staying in touch with his team and ""thinking of new ideas and concepts."" And being able to rest a bit ""has been welcome.""

""Anyone who knows me knows I love a good challenge. This is certainly a big challenge. I can't wait to get back and do great things,"" he added.

Slate, a multi-floor lounge and nightclub with multiple bars and hundreds of hands-on games like pool and ping pong, has catered to Manhattan's lively late-night crowds for over 20 years. But it could struggle welcoming back customers at a 6-foot distance.

Owner Aristotle ""Telly"" Hatzigeorgiou told ABC News, ""We're adjusting as best we can.""

The owner's plan for a return to operations will eventually include ""strict sanitation guidelines that will be followed between each use, and we'll make sure all tables, chairs and games are spread apart enough that people can safely socially distance themselves.""

A gust plays pool at Slate in New York City in an undated photo, before the coronavirus pandemic. Slate

He added: ""Temperatures will be taken at the door. Hand sanitation stations will be placed all over the venue, and markers will be placed both inside and on the sidewalk outside for any line that may form to ensure guests stay 6 feet apart while we check IDs, take temperatures and check coats.""

Hatzigeorgiou plans to take full advantage of the sprawling 17,000-square foot, two-floor space. ""Once restaurants are given the OK to open in NYC,"" he said, ""we can start to open some parts of Slate.""

For bars with live music, like Howl at the Moon in San Antonio, COVID-19 could silence the big, bustling crowds that scribble down song requests and pass the papers up through the bar to the stage.

Denise Ramirez, a musician who plays piano at the hopping venue on the San Antonio Riverwalk, told ABC News that after three years there she has a different perspective for what a new normal could mean.

""Howl is typically a packed house, especially on weekends when we get a lot of bachelorette parties and birthday parties booking up tables,"" she said.

The music-centric bar has 14 different locations in the U.S. and has to keep track of ""all the different regulations being put in place by different state and local governments,"" Ramirez explained. ""I can only assume that's only made it more difficult for them as a company to figure out what they're going to do.""

""Their plan is to wait until bars can open at a full capacity or near-full capacity, because in their words, 'Howl has to be Howl,' which makes sense to me,"" the pianist said. ""I've been part of a now-closed Howl establishment in New York City and have seen what happens if it tries to remain open for only five people on a Tuesday. And I think it's the right move.""

Ramirez and the other entertainers, bartenders, servers and door attendants were furloughed, and she thinks they will ""wait quite a bit before reopening,"" even with the state of Texas currently reopening restaurants at 25% capacity. ""The return to nightlife is going to be a mixed bag. I would expect lots of excitement from everyone having cabin fever, but I'd also expect quite a few rules in place.""

""I don't think anyone wants to be singing on stage with masks on,"" Ramirez said about a discussion with her fellow musician friends. ""We turn to nightlife to escape from our problems, so having a reminder of the pandemic onstage in front of us would kind of defeat that purpose.""

“They’re really good results,” Dr. Richard Novak, chief of infectious disease at UIC, told the Sun-Times Wednesday of the drug made by Gilead Sciences, called remdesivir.

He added: “That’s great and should give some people a sense of relief who are concerned about getting sick.”

Remdesivir is the first drug to show such promising results against the virus, which has killed more than 218,000 people since it emerged late last year in China. Having a treatment could have a profound effect on the global pandemic, especially because health officials say any vaccine is likely a year or more away.

Get the latest news about the coronavirus and its ripple effects in Chicago and Illinois in our live blog.

The study, run by the National Institutes of Health, tested remdesivir versus the usual care given in 1,063 hospitalized coronavirus patients around the world. At the White House, NIH’s Dr. Anthony Fauci said the drug reduced the time it takes patients to recover by 31% — 11 days on average versus 15 days for those just given usual care.

Can block virus

He also said there was a trend toward fewer deaths among those on remdesivir, and that full results would soon be published in a medical journal.

“What it has proven is that a drug can block this virus,” Fauci said. “This will be the standard of care.”

A statement from the Food and Drug Administration says that the agency has been talking with California-based Gilead “regarding making remdesivir available to patients as quickly as possible, as appropriate.”

The drug is given through an IV and is designed to interfere with the virus’s ability to copy its genetic material. In animal tests against SARS and MERS, diseases caused by similar coronaviruses, the drug helped prevent infection and reduced the severity of symptoms when given early enough in the course of illness. But it is not yet approved anywhere in the world for any use.

Only hospitalized patients can use

Because the drug is given through an IV, only patients who are hospitalized will be able to receive it for the time being, Novak said.

“It’s going to be challenging to give in an outpatient setting,” Novak said.

The drug will also continue to be tested with other drugs to see if a combination of treatments will produce more positive outcomes, he said.

“We’re not done yet. We still need to find more and better treatments,” Novak said.

A less encouraging picture came from partial results from a separate study testing remdesivir in severely ill patients in China, published Wednesday in the British medical journal Lancet. Treatment did not speed recovery in that study, which was stopped after only 237 of a planned 453 patients were enrolled.

2nd study shows improvements

Separately on Wednesday, Gilead announced partial results from its own ongoing study of the drug in severely ill, hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The company said of patients who were treated with remdesivir within five days of an onset of symptoms, 65% achieved clinical recovery and 60% were discharged.

However, the results are difficult to interpret because there is no comparison group of people getting usual care, so it’s impossible to know how much patients would have improved on their own.

Stroger Hospital, which is taking part in the trial, has seen results that are “similar and consistent” with the overall results released by Gilead so far, said Dr. Gregory Huhn, an infectious disease physician for Cook County Health and principal site investigator for the trial here.

Huhn, however, said it will take more than a single drug to beat back this novel coronavirus.

“We need multiple strategies to defeat COVID-19,” Huhn said. “I think this drug ... in combination with a future vaccine, [could] provide a multi-pronged attack on COVID-19. So, I really think that an effective therapeutic along with effective prevention is going to get us to the other side of this pandemic.”

Stroger is also taking part in a trial examining more moderate COVID-19 cases. No results have yet been announced from that second study, which does have a comparison group getting usual care. The company said no new safety problems emerged in that study, and that it would publish results in a medical journal soon.

Other drugs researched

In other treatment-related news this week, two studies gave updates on anti-inflammatory drugs that aim to tamp down the severe inflammation that often develops in later stages of severe COVID-19 and often proves fatal.

A French hospital consortium reported success with using Acetemra, a Roche drug sold for rheumatoid arthritis and some other conditions, in a study of 129 coronavirus patients where 65 got the drug and the rest, usual care. No details were released; doctors said they were preparing to publish results.

A similar drug, Kevzara, did not work as well at low doses in a study of severely ill coronavirus patients, its makers Sanofi and Regeneron said. They’re continuing to test it at higher doses in critically ill patients, though.

Social distancing still needed

Novak said that the success of treating patients with remdesivir doesn’t mean that its use will necessarily have a significant impact on the need to continue social distancing.

“People are still dying from COVID-19, even with treatment from remdesivir,” Novak said. “The biggest concern has been [sick patients] overwhelming our hospitals with the number of cases. This won’t change that. We still need to be reducing the number of new cases.”

The shifts are long and the scenes are heartbreaking inside a Maryland hospital where nurses and doctors have been treating coronavirus patients for weeks, unable to let family inside to visit loved ones on their death beds.

One of the hardest moments of a recent work day for registered nurse Julia Trainor was intubating a patient, and then calling the patient's husband so he could talk to his wife. He was not allowed in the hospital.

""I had to put him on the phone and hold the phone to her ear as he told her that he loved her so much, and then I had to wipe away her tears,"" says Trainor, who works in a surgical intensive care unit. ""I'm used to seeing very sick patients and I'm used to patients dying, but nothing quite like this.""

""The hardest moment was a young woman who died and her family wasn't able to be here with her,"" Bowers said. ""I think right now, it's just frustrating and scary just not knowing what comes next."" Dr. Kyle Fischer, 35, an emergency medicine doctor who is caring for COVID-19 patients, poses for a photograph after a 12-hour shift. ""Since it's a new virus, we don't have any experience with it. For most diseases I am used to seeing it and taking care of it and this, I don't have any starting place. I know what I'm hearing from New York, I've read all of the papers it seems like, but no one knows what the correct answers are, so there's a huge amount of uncertainty and people are really, really sick. So it's hard to second guess whether or not you are doing the right thing when you think you are but you never quite know,"" said Fischer. Kaitlyn Martiniano, 25, a registered nurse who works at a biocontainment unit with COVID-19 patients, poses for a photograph after a 12.5-hour shift. ""We have a lot of patients and they are pretty sick right now but we have not yet been hit as hard as New York or Seattle, so I feel like we are very lucky with that so far. Every day you have to just be optimistic."" Said Martiniano. ""I think the reason that we are not being hit as hard right now is because so many things are closed, and because so many people are staying at home."" Jacqueline Hamil, 30, a registered nurse who is caring for COVID-19 patients in an emergency department, poses for a photograph after a 12-hour shift. ""The hardest moment of my shift today, I was in charge, and we had a really sick patient that was in a really, really small room and usually, when we have sick crashing patients, we can have a ton of resources and a ton of staff go in and help with the nurse and the doctors that are taking care of that patient. But due to the patient being ruled out for the coronavirus, we could only have five or six people in the room at a time and putting on all the gowns and gloves and masks and face shields to protect us in case the patient does have coronavirus, it takes a while, so the nurse that was in there, ended up being in the room for you know 6, 7 hours with minimal breaks and it was hard being in charge and knowing that she was stuck in the room and really nothing I could do to help her,"" Hamil said.

Story The highly infectious COVID-19 disease caused by the novel coronavirus has infected more than 580,000 people across the United States and killed nearly 24,000. In Maryland, where residents have been ordered to stay at home since March 30 to stem the spread of the disease, around 9,000 have tested positive for the virus and more than 260 have died. After finishing what for many was a more than 12-hour shift, some nurses and doctors at one hospital shared with Reuters the hardest moments of their days. The hospital asked that it not be named. The medical workers agreed that one of the toughest parts of the job - more than the exhausting schedule or adjusting to work in a new unit - was witnessing the toll on patients and families.

Capadngan, 29, poses for a photograph after a 12-hour shift Because of the hospital's no-visitor policy, which was implemented to prevent further spread of the virus, the medical staff must care for the patients' physical needs and offer as much emotional support as they can muster in the absence of the patients' families. ""The hardest moment during the shift was just seeing COVID patients die helpless and without their family members beside them,"" says Ernest Capadngan, a nurse in the hospital's biocontainment unit.

Wilson, 53, poses for a photograph after a 12-hour shift. ""There is a lot of unknowns and with that unknown is a lot of anxiety and stress that we're not used to dealing with,"" said Wilson. Communicating with the families has weighed heavily on the hospital staff. Staff cannot bend the no-visit rules, even when a family calls in desperation. ""I had a patient fall out of bed today and I had to call his wife and tell her and she couldn't come see him, even though she pleaded and begged to come see him,"" says Tracey Wilson, a nurse practitioner.

Fare, 25, poses for a photograph after a 13-hour shift. ""My team has been really great to me. We've worked really well together and we've really come together in this crisis. We don't really know each other, we all come from different units within the same hospital, so for us to come together and work so well as a team, it's been a journey but I think that's what is giving me hope,"" said Fare. ""One of the hardest moments was having to see a family member of a COVID patient say goodbye over an iPad,"" says Tiffany Fare, a nurse in the biocontainment unit. ""You can't see your loved one and then they're gone.""

Mack, 46, poses for a photograph after a 12-hour shift. ""The Covid-19 spread has affected a lot of livelihood, a lot of people's lives. It has created a crisis, death in general. So I would like to ask not one single person, but all people worldwide, to converge and join the platform that this is something that nobody can fight individually,"" said Mack. There are very few opportunities to rest during a shift, although colleagues look out for one another and try to cover for each other when someone needs a break. Cheryll Mack, a registered nurse in the emergency room, says she tries to get outside for 15 minutes during the day to breathe. ""It has given me relief, just fresh air,"" Mack says.

Bell, 41, poses for a photograph after a six-hour shift. ""The hardest thing in all of this, has been taking care of fellow healthcare providers. It really hits home and it's really scary when you see someone that could be you coming in and now you're taking care of them. It's also hitting home that once healthcare providers start getting sick, who is going to be taking care of the public,"" Bell said. Each shift concludes with a similar decontamination drill. Nurses and doctors must remove their personal protective equipment and shower immediately before coming in contact with their family at home. ""I take a very long, very hot shower. And then I usually sit on the couch and... read a book or watch some mindless reality show in order to destress,"" says Martine Bell, a nurse practitioner.

Dr. Bontempo, 50, poses for a photograph after a nine-hour shift. ""I'm used to treating sick patients. I treat sick patients all the time. It's very different knowing that the patient you are treating, is actually a risk to you as well. That's the main difference here. No one who works in hospitals is afraid of treating sick people. Just want to keep staff safe and the patients safe at the same time,"" said Bontempo. Laura Bontempo, an emergency medicine physician, says she removes her work clothing and gear in a decontamination tent she has set up outside her home, and then wraps herself in a towel and runs inside to shower. Then she puts the scrubs in the washing machine by themselves to not contaminate any other items.

Sheehan, 27, poses for a photograph after a 12-hour shift. ""I think the hardest moment has been the fear that lives within all of us. There is a lot of unknown right now. We fear what's going to happen tomorrow, how the emergency department will look next week when we come in. We have fears about our own colleagues, whether they will fall ill. We also fear that we could be asymptomatic carriers and bring this virus home to our families and our loved ones. There has been a lot of fear over our supplies and whether we'll run out. And then obviously there is the fear that we will see patients and not be able to do everything we normally can to help save patients' lives,"" said Sheehan.",real

Eight Washington counties have received the OK to move forward with the second phase of reopening, which includes allowing restaurants to offer dine-in service at 50 percent capacity, according to the Seattle Times.

Gov. Jay Inslee's rules require restaurants that reopen to keep a daily log of customers, including their names and contact information. The logs are to be kept for 30 days, when they can be used to trace coronavirus infections.

There have been 17,773 confirmed cases and 993 deaths from COVID-19 in the state, according to date from Johns Hopkins University.

As businesses in the counties cleared for limited reopening get rolling, there are 13 regulations that they must adhere to.

In addition to the log, they will also be required to move tables far enough that there is a 6-foot distance between guests at different tables.

The state is also urging restaurants to require face coverings even when guests are not seated at their tables. Bar seating and buffets are not permitted.

Restaurants are required to provide hand sanitizer to staff and guests and screen employees for signs of COVID-19 at the beginning of each shift. A COVID-19 supervisor must be assigned to enforce the site's safety plans.

Influenza (flu) is defined as an acute, commonly epidemic disease, occurring in several forms, caused by numerous rapidly mutating viral strains and characterized by respiratory symptoms and general prostration. (1) The flu has a major impact on the lungs. Colds start in the nose and upper respiratory tract. Vomiting and diarrhea are assigned to yet another viral family.

Corona Virus

We are currently in the grip of a media frenzy and potential public health disaster. A new type of corona virus has emerged from a large city in China, Wuhan, and the world is bracing for an impact of a major epidemic. We have been here before, however, we have already experienced MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) and SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) along with the same specter of massive numbers of deaths. Corona viruses are thought to be generally mild and not very virulent. This type of virus is found very commonly in animals. Some now believe that the virus for MERS, SARS and now the Wuhan Virus has somehow unnaturally been transmitted to humans, and humans have now become another vector for this infection.

Western Medicine, Louis Pasteur and Antoine Béchamp

We have developed Western medicine primarily by following the teaching of French chemist Louis Pasteur (1822-1895) and the Germ Theory of Disease. Pasteur believed that diseases were caused by outside pathogens invading the body. Antoine Béchamp a Pasteur contemporary, disagreed. He believed that it was that the condition of the body, the terrain, was the source of illness. A healthy body is dependent upon its acid/base balance; its charge; the amount of toxicity and its nutritional status. Only tissue that is already diseased can harbor organisms that become pathogenic. We are starting to appreciate our complicated relationships with the microbial world as we have begun to explore the wonderful world of our microbiomes. This disease theories of Pasteur have led us to the doctrines of virology and immunology. This evolution began before we learned anything about vitamins, trace minerals and other nutrients. (2)

Vaccinate!

Western medicine is now leaving the world of antibiotics. Antibiotics are failing and have served to create more pathogens that are resistant to antibiotic treatments. Western medicine is now embracing vaccination. And why not? There are untold numbers of microbes and 7.8 billion people on earth to experiment upon. Pharmaceutical companies have more and more vaccines in their pipelines. All they must do is to convince us and our governments that their vaccines are the only thing that saves us from vast epidemics, severe illness and probably death. And not a surprise the Corona virus has already been patented. Even at best, this season’s flu vaccines have already proven to be 70% ineffective. The promise of herd immunity does not hold up with vaccinated populations. (3)

Nine Months to a Corona Vaccine

On January 23, 2020 the company Moderna, Inc announced that it is partnering with the US National Institutes of Health (4) to develop a vaccine to prevent infection by the corona virus within the next 9 months. They promise new technology to address this life-threatening epidemic. Sound good? It might be if vaccinations worked. It might be if organisms didn’t rapidly mutate to new forms as they pass through their vectors. It might be if vaccines didn’t also depend on heavy metals to aggravate the immune system. It might be if animal and human DNA from the viral growth medium weren’t injected into the body without any clue for the long-term consequences. Vaccines do not work.

How is the Flu Deadly?

Most of us have experienced the respiratory illness that is characterized as the flu at some point in our lives. Temperatures rise as it is part of the body’s natural defense mechanism, but not always. There are aches and pains and general malaise and coughing. Most of us take to our beds until we feel better. However, some days after the viral assault, pneumonia (inflammation of the lungs), caused by bacteria can set in. This infection can become life threatening as it spreads, and organ systems become compromised. If someone is already struggling with organ system problems, let’s say with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or renal issues, this can become the tipping point. The infection can lead to sepsis, a systemic inflammatory response, shutting down organ systems leading to death. Even in young healthy people, this response, also called a cytokine storm, can overwhelm the body.

Back to Antoine Béchamp

This is the other option. We can choose to help our body’s terrain remain in its healthy state, and if we get sick we can choose to return our body to that healthy state rather than embrace warfare on our microbial world and be left with the consequences of the “friendly fire”. The rest of this article will focus on staying well and getting well despite a flu epidemic. Admittedly, it is getting to be more and more difficult. Our water, our air and our food have become compromised like never before in human history.

Basic and Free (or almost)

Wash your hands. We can’t live our lives and avoid contact with other people. However, we can minimize the challenges to our immune system by frequently washing your hands. After the SARS outbreak in 2003, a Toronto epidemiologist related that the installation of numerous handwashing stations and maintaining sanitary protocols stopped the spread of SARS in its tracks. (5)

Plain soap and water will do. You can find alcohol and chemical wipes everywhere, but this is not the best choice as these chemicals strip your skin of their natural oils which also protect you. It’s better to use wipes that have been infused with essential oils. Essential oils have power antiviral activities and can be inhaled and infused. Using a diffuser in public spaces such as schools could cut down viral transmission. This reference holds a long list of the most effective essential oils and herbal remedies. (6)

The So-Called Flu Season.

“...it has been my observation that those patients receiving a Vitamin D injection in the fall have never had a substantial cold or flu during the winter. Interestingly, the dose of a single injection is 400,000 IU (International Units). While that seems a substantial dose, after administering many thousands of injections, I have never seen an example of the Vitamin D levels climbing too high. As a matter of fact, some individuals are so depleted at the intracellular level that they might need 2 or 3 injections over the winter months to preserve optimal levels of vitamin D.” Dr. Dale Guyer, Indianapolis posting in Facebook.

Vitamin D is a primary tool for preventing infection of all kinds. The flu season coincides with the greatest lack of sunshine and the opportunity to create vitamin D in the skin. It is easily supplemented. Optimal levels should be 70-80 ng/ml. Supplementing vitamin D can be preventative. High doses can be used to treat an acute incidence of the flu. (7)

Linus Pauling and Vitamin C

Linus Pauling’s claim to fame was to make vitamin C a household word. He extolled the virtues of vitamin for prevention and treatment for colds and the flu. Vitamin C can be used in smaller doses as prevention and ramped up to bowel tolerance for treatment. In severe cases, a physician may offer even higher doses in an IV treatment to speed recovery from the flu. Using vitamin C in a phospholipid delivery system can also provide higher and effective doses. (8)

Hydrocortisone

Dr. William Jefferies spent his entire career studying hydrocortisone or cortisol. In his 80’s, he made an interesting discovery. After deliberately infecting some volunteer students, he discovered that the virus inhibited the pituitary hormone ACTH which is responsible for the adrenal production of hydrocortisone. That feeling of malaise and the aches and pains and headaches that come with the flu are quickly eradicated by using supplemental hydrocortisone. Practitioners can provide the drug Cortef to be used orally. However, hydrocortisone 1 % cream can be found in drug stores and applied to the skin. To prevent the flu, establish that there are no underlying hydrocortisone deficiencies. Practitioners rely on an Adrenal Stress Index saliva test or morning cortisol in the serum to identify problems. Dr. Jefferies used maintenance doses such as 5 mg of hydrocortisone every 6 hours. In the case of an acute flu, larger doses should be used immediately, and relief is rapid. (9)

Ozone

Antibiotics are starting to fail as mentioned above. But we really don’t have to worry much despite the dire prognostications. Ozone, a gas, which is a very reactive form of oxygen can treat any infection. Ozone treated water can be used in hand washing and cleaning surfaces. Ozonated oils such as olive oil can be gargled if there is a sore throat. You can use ozone in your ears, vaginally, or rectally for a full body treatment. You can also ozonate your bath water. A practitioner can help you with intravenous options if a serious infection has persisted. The American Association of Ozone Therapy is a great resource to learn about ozone. (10)

To Be Continued

We are just scratching the surface so far on all the methods we may use to deter getting an infection and what steps we can take to treat an infection. Humanity has survived on the earth for millions of years. There are multiple modalities, both conventional and traditional that can strengthen the immune system and help prevent infections. We can open the door to rediscover and identify our rich histories of healing modalities. We have choices. We don’t have to rely only on hastily devised, unproven and untested therapies alone.

Matt Damon and his family are self-isolating in the small seaside town of Dalkey in Ireland.

Since Dalkey is not used to hosting A-list celebrities, the actor has become the talk of the town. Damon agreed to an interview on an Irish radio show, ""Fully Charged,"" where the hosts asked him to surprise a fan who just happens to be a nurse on the front lines of the coronavirus battle.

To kick off the interview, Damon explained that he was in Europe filming a movie when production moved to Ireland but then shut down due to coronavirus.

Rather than fly home, he and his family chose to stay put in Dalkey, and they've been there for about two months now.

""I don't know if you're fully aware that the Dalkey people are protecting you like a glorious gem,"" radio host Nathan O'Reilly told Damon during the interview.

Locals have even created a Facebook group to track Damon — and he's aware of it. ""That's when I realized how great this place was and how protective everybody is here,"" Damon said. ""I had no idea this was happening behind the scenes."" O'Reilly admitted joining the group to try and find Damon for the interview.

The reason Damon agreed to do the interview was because a famous friend convinced him to. U2 singer Bono lives nearby, and while the pals can't see each other face to face due to social distancing rules, they have been FaceTiming. On one call, the Irish singer told Damon: ""You know, there's a local radio station that's looking for you.""

""That was the final impetus for me,"" Damon said. ""I was like, 'I really got to check those guys out and call into the show.'"" The hosts were absolutely delighted that Bono helped facilitate the interview, which they conducted with Damon via video conference.

Damon called Dalkey ""incredible"" and one of the most beautiful places his family has ever been. ""Obviously what's going on in the world is horrible, but for my family, it timed out right,"" Damon said. ""I'm with my whole family and I have my kids and we have teachers with us because we were planning on missing school for about eight weeks. So we have what nobody has, which is live human beings teaching our kids.""

Damon knows this is a luxury for parents in a time of remote learning. He's also grateful that in a time when travel is limited, he's stuck in a picturesque place.

Damon said while most of his family is together in Ireland, his eldest daughter, Alexia, from his wife Luciana Bozán Barroso's previous marriage, is in college in New York City. She and her roommates had COVID-19 ""early on,"" Damon said, adding ""she got through it fine,"" and she will reunite with the rest of the family at the end of the month.

Of course, the hosts couldn't end the interview without asking Damon about ""Contagion,"" the prescient 2011 film about an uncontrollable pandemic. ""You're oddly prepared for this because you were in 'Contagion.' Life is literally imitating art now,"" host Graham O'Toole said.

Damon said has spoken to screenwriter Scott Burns and some of the people who consulted on the movie about the current pandemic. ""Anybody who says you couldn't predict this, just look at 'Contagion.' I mean, 10 years ago we made a movie just by talking to experts and asking them how this would look and how it would kind of go down,"" Damon said.

""The whole thing is just tragic and sad. I hope some good can come out of it. Luckily, this isn't as lethal as it might've been, so maybe this is a dry run for the big one that might come along, because these things do come along every few decades,"" he continued. ""Best to be ready for it.""

To end the interview, the hosts had Damon surprise a nurse who asked if there was any way she could see him. The nurse, Anais, who is from France but lives in Dublin, was shocked to see Damon join the video conference. ""I just can't breathe at all,"" she said.

Damon thanked Anais for all she and other frontline workers are doing. ""I feel like that is the one thing to come out of this — we will never ever ever look at you guys the same. And that's a good thing,"" he told the nurse.",real

A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump’s measures of success. But after a manic 3½ years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.

By far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. “I’m not going to play that game,” said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. “I think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they’re not uniform across states and across countries.”

But even beyond the death count, there’s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. “I’m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,” the official said.

Some Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn’t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn’t been able to focus on getting the response right.

Trump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. “So it is a war and I define victory when it’s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,” he said on May 1. “It can never be a total victory because too many people have died.”

When American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn’t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush’s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.

Others are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. “Allowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,” argued one Republican close to the president.

“The closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.” Sen. Lindsey Graham

But, he added, “If things don’t look like they’re bouncing back by September, I think that’s going to be a problem.”

The fear that Trump can’t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.

When asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump’s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the “economic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.”

A spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.

Others are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)",real

Voting by proxy — without being ""present"" as the Constitution requires — is an unprecedented move, which wasn't even resorted to during other challenging moments in US history.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Neither Civil War nor Great Depression nor any other national crisis has pushed the House to allow lawmakers to vote by proxy — without being ""present,"" as the Constitution requires. That's about to change during the coronavirus pandemic.

The House approved Friday a package of historic rules changes so Congress can keep functioning even while it's partly closed. The shift will dramatically change the look, if not the operation, of the legislative branch — launching a 21st century WFH House, like others, ""working from home.""

Members Congress clinb the steps of the House of Representatives for final votes, at the Capitol in Washington, Thursday, July 31, 2014. AP

""This House must continue legislating,"" Rep. Jim McGovern, the chairman of the House Rules Committee, said during a lengthy session ahead of the vote. ""And we have to do so in a way that is safe for all those around us.""

Debate over the changes has been fierce. As President Donald Trump encourages Americans back to work, the 435-member House has stayed away due to health risks while the smaller Senate has resumed operations.

Democrats argue the House can rely on technology for remote work as the pandemic drags on. But Republicans objected to what they see as a power grab during the crisis. The vote was 217-189.

Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma, the top Republican on the rules panel, warned the changes will fundamentally alter the nature of the institution, ""and not for the better.""

One by one Republicans lined up Friday to speak against it.

""We should all get to Washington, do our jobs,"" said Rep. Bradley Byre, R-Ala.

Under the new rules, House lawmakers will no longer be required to travel to Washington to participate in floor votes. They will be allowed to vote by proxy — assigning their vote to another lawmaker who will be at the Capitol to cast it for them. Eventually, a provision allows for direct remote voting, once the technology is approved.

Just as important, the House committees — the bread and butter of legislative work — will be able to fully function remotely. Committee hearings are prime-time for lawmakers — the chance to grill officials, spar with colleagues and have much of it captured on C-SPAN. House lawmakers will be able to draft bills, conduct oversight and even issue subpoenas from the comfort of their homes.

""This is about allowing the people's House — and the people's representatives in committees — to work,"" Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., who has helped lead the effort, testified before the Rules Committee.

With the Capitol physician warning it could be years before Congress resumes full operations, lawmakers are anxious to chart a new normal and not be sidelined.

Rep. Mary Scanlon (D-PA) tweeted this ""surreal"" photo of the House chamber as members of Congress practiced social distancing during a Friday vote. Twitter/Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon

An earlier proposal was shelved two weeks ago as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi insisted she wanted any change of this significance to be bipartisan. She tapped a task force to try to reach a bipartisan compromise.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy proposed a ""hybrid"" plan that would allow the committees to conduct work remotely but stopped short of allowing the proxy voting on the floor.

A key Trump ally, McCarthy argues if other Americans are at work, Congress should be, too. ""It's a very sad day inside this House,"" the California Republican said. He mocked Pelosi for having claimed the House would serve as the ""captain"" of the ship, last to leave during the crisis, only to go home.

The changes are expected to be temporary, only through the remainder of this session of Congress, at the end of the year. Democrats insist the changes should be used only under times of crisis.

But Republicans warn there will be legal challenges to legislation passed during this period, questioning the constitutional legitimacy of proxy votes. The House has never allowed proxy floor votes, even during some of the most challenging eras in the nation's history. Lawmakers convened during the 1918 Spanish Flu epidemic and only stayed away a short time after the 2001 terror attacks. Proxy votes had been allowed in committees, but that ended decades ago. Under the new rules, one lawmaker can carry up to 10 votes by proxy to the Capitol.

""You got to be here,"" said another Trump ally, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio. ""You can't phone it in.""

But Hoyer, quoting President Abraham Lincoln, told his colleagues, ""We must act and think anew.""",real

152,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/25/health/coronavirus-immunity-antibodies.html,2020-03-25,Can You Become Immune to the Coronavirus?,"
As the number of people infected with the coronavirus surpasses 450,000 worldwide, and more than one billion are locked in their homes, scientists are wrestling with one of the most pressing questions of the pandemic: Do people who survive the infection become immune to the virus?
The answer is a qualified yes, with some significant unknowns. That’s important for several reasons.
People who are confirmed to be immune could venture from their homes and help shore up the work force until a vaccine becomes available, for example. In particular, health care workers who are known to be immune could continue to care for the severely ill.
Growing immunity in the community also is the way the epidemic ends: With fewer and fewer people to infect, the coronavirus will lose its toehold and even the most vulnerable citizens become more insulated from the threat.
Immunity may also bring an early treatment. Antibodies gathered from the bodies of those who have recovered may be used to aid those struggling with the illness caused by the coronavirus, called Covid-19.
On Tuesday, the Food and Drug Administration approved the use of plasma from recovered patients to treat some severe cases. A day earlier, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced that New York would become the first state to begin testing serum from people who have recovered from Covid-19 to treat those who are seriously ill.
“It’s a trial for people who are in serious condition, but the New York State Department of Health has been working on this with some of New York’s best health care agencies, and we think it shows promise,” Mr. Cuomo said.
The body’s first line of defense against an infectious virus is an antibody called immunoglobulin M, whose job is to stay vigilant in the body and alert the rest of the immune system to intruders like viruses and bacteria.
Days into an infection, the immune system refines this antibody into a second type, called immunoglobulin G, exquisitely designed to recognize and neutralize a specific virus.
The refinement may take as long as a week; both the process and the potency of the final antibodies can vary. Some people make powerful neutralizing antibodies to an infection, while others mount a milder response.
The antibodies generated in response to infection with some viruses — polio or measles, for example — bestow a lifetime of immunity. But antibodies to the coronaviruses that cause the common cold persist for just one to three years — and that may be true of their new cousin as well.
A study in macaques infected with the new coronavirus suggested that once infected, the monkeys produce neutralizing antibodies and resist further infection. But it is unclear how long the monkeys, or people infected with the virus, will remain immune.
Most people who became infected during the SARS epidemic — that virus is a close cousin of the new coronavirus, called SARS-CoV-2 — had long-term immunity lasting eight to 10 years, said Vineet D. Menachery, a virologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston.
Those who recovered from MERS, another coronavirus, saw much shorter-term protection, Dr. Menachery said. People who have been infected with the new coronavirus may have immunity lasting at least one to two years, he added: “Beyond that, we can’t predict.”
Still, even if antibody protection were short-lasting and people became reinfected, the second bout with the coronavirus would likely be much milder than the first, said Florian Krammer, a microbiologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York.
Even after the body stops producing neutralizing antibodies, a subset of immune memory cells can reactivate a response effectively, he noted.
“You probably would make a good immune response before you even become symptomatic again and might really blunt the course of the disease,” Dr. Krammer said.
A crucial question is whether children and adults who have only mild symptoms still generate a strong enough response to remain immune to the virus until a vaccine is available.
Dr. Marion Koopmans, a virologist at Erasmus University in Rotterdam, and her team have screened antibody responses in 15 infected patients and health care workers.
The researchers are also using banked blood samples from about 100 people who were known to be infected with one of four coronaviruses known to cause the common cold.
If those samples show some immune response to the new coronavirus, too, Dr. Koopmans said, it might explain why some people — children, for example — have only mild symptoms. They may have antibodies to related coronaviruses that are at least somewhat effective against the new one.
The quickest way to assess immunity is a blood test that looks for protective antibodies in the blood of people who have recovered. But first you have to have the test.
Antibody tests are used in Singapore, China and a handful of other countries. But they are just coming to market in much of the West.
Last week, Dr. Krammer and his colleagues developed one such antibody test that could be scaled up in “days to weeks,” he said.
The team validated the test in blood plasma taken from three patients with Covid-19. The researchers are seeking speedy approval from the F.D.A.
Dozens of other labs are also at work on a dizzying list of tests, although they, too, are mostly based on slim data that has not yet been reviewed by other scientists.
“No matter who makes them, as long as they’re reliable, that’s a super nice tool,” Dr. Krammer said. Because this is a new coronavirus, the test should deliver “basically, a yes or no answer, like an H.I.V. test — you can figure out who was exposed and who wasn’t.”
On Wednesday, officials of Public Health England said they had purchased millions of newly developed antibody tests and were evaluating them for patients to use at home. Citizens who discovered they had been exposed and now had some immunity to the coronavirus might be able to return to normal lives, the officials said.
That would be particularly useful for health care workers. Those who know they have at least some immunity could be placed on the front lines of emergency care, sparing colleagues who have not been exposed.
[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]“If this really goes on for months at a time, for 18 months as some people have projected, having health care workers who are immune to the virus will be really, really helpful,” said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University in New York.
But tests like these may not be of much use for diagnosis of coronavirus infection as it gets underway, because of the time it takes for the body to begin producing antibodies.
Dr. Krammer’s test picks up an antibody response as early as three days after symptoms emerge. Given that people may not show symptoms for as long as 14 days after infection, however, that is too late for the test to be useful as a diagnostic tool.
Finding people with powerful antibody responses might help point the way to new treatments, however. Essentially, antibodies extracted from the blood of recovered patients are injected into those who are ill.
Several teams have already been working on such an effort, following early reports from China of success. A Beijing-based company called AnyGo Technology has provided 50,000 tests to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and to hospitals in Wuhan, Beijing and Shanghai, according to its founder, Dr. Le Sun.
Dr. Shangen Zheng, a doctor with the Chinese military, said his team had treated more than 10 patients so far, and data from many more patients treated with plasma in Hubei Province is being assessed.
This approach is actually “something very old-fashioned,” Dr. Krammer said. It was used to save American soldiers infected with the hemorrhagic Hantaan virus during the Korean War, and to treat people in Argentina infected with the hemorrhagic Junin virus.
Before the method can be put into wide use, however, scientists must work out safety issues, such as ensuring that the plasma taken from recovered patients is free of other viruses and toxins.
Pharmaceutical companies like Takeda and Regeneron are hoping to sidestep some of those questions by developing antibodies against the coronavirus in the laboratory.
Ultimately, it is only with these tests that scientists will be able to say when enough of the population has been infected and has become immune — and when the virus has begun to run out of hosts.Reporting was contributed by Denise Grady.",real

Already we're seeing warning signs: businesses that could stay closed despite the economy reopening, businesses not feeling confident enough to invest, and state and local government not being able to bounce back.

There is a way to prevent the slow growth problem: Congress needs to pass more stimulus.

George Pearkes is the global macro strategist for Bespoke Investment Group.

This is an opinion column. The thoughts expressed are those of the author.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

US economic activity has started to bounce from its COVID-19 recession lows, but focus on short-term improvements ignores the pain that could stick around for years to come.

A wide variety of high-frequency data indicators from airport passenger volumes to demand for gasoline to applications home loans have all bounced as Renaissance Macro economist Neil Dutta wrote last week, and companies are also reporting encouraging trends in late April through early May.

That's good news, and a sign that the combined support from Congress and the Federal Reserve has prevented the worst-case scenario, while the gradual reopening of the economy allows for some consumer activity that wasn't feasible before.

Taking a step back, however, reveals a deeply concerning picture.

A lesson from the financial crisis

From 1947 to 2007, per capita real GDP of the US economy rose very predictably and steadily over time by about 2.2% per person per year.

But following the last global crisis, instead of returning to that steady trend, output shifted to a lower gear. CUNY economist JW Mason has identified the huge difference between the old trend and the new one as a policy failure that could have been avoided.

That shortfall in real GDP has huge consequences over the long-term. By the fourth quarter of 2019, it meant the standard of living (roughly proxied by the level of GDP per person) Americans enjoyed was over 20% lower than it would have been if the country returned to its post-World War II, pre-2007 trend.

The concern for the US economy now is not whether easing lockdowns lead to more activity than during the depth of the lockdown, but whether the climb in economic activity returns to the pre-pandemic trend or not.

Returning to the post-2009 trend is much easier than to the pre-2008 trend; it requires just 1.6% per person real output growth per year, lower hanging fruit than the 2.2% from pre-crisis.

But there is a lingering question about whether the country can achieve that relatively modest goal.

There are three primary reasons.

The destruction of small businesses

First, the permanent closure of businesses, especially small businesses. A team of economists from the University of Chicago published a paper last week that suggested 40% of job losses through April were thanks to permanent business shutdowns.

When businesses close, workers can get re-hired elsewhere and owner-operators can find new sources of income, but the process of re-hiring and finding new income is slowed relative to if the business simply re-opens its doors. Therefore a bounce-back in activity may be slowed by fewer businesses being able to reopen.

Weak investment

Second, capital expenditures. A huge range of companies ranging from tech giants like Facebook or Microsoft to oil producers like Exxon Mobil or Occidental have reduced their planned capital expenditures — investments in big ticket items like new facilities or equipment — for 2020.

That foregone capex is both lost income for suppliers of companies, but it also means that future economic gains from that new equipment or factory are lost.

Weak post-financial crisis capex was one widely-cited reason for slow growth. The economy never saw investment rise above 5% of GDP in the last cycle (net of depreciation), which is usually the low point during previous recessions.

Low investment and low growth are a mutually reinforcing cycle — if there is low growth then companies are less likely to feel comfortable spending on big projects, but the lack of this capital investment then limits the ability of the economy to grow. This vicious cycle has kept growth low following the last crisis and we may be on that path again.

Hampered state and local governments

Thirdly, state and local governments are running out of funds to support their citizens.

Most state and local governments have some form of mandate to run balanced operating budgets, so when tax receipts fall, outlays must as well. These governments cut a million jobs in April (70% of which were education-related) and will continue to shrink their workforces as long as sales and income tax receipts lag.

Ongoing contraction from governments, who are crucial employers and economic actors, will weigh on the whole country's economic bounce.

Potential good news

While this may seem quite gloomy, there are some offsetting factors.

The stock market's recent bounce is actually good news for capex. Rising stock prices send a signal to management teams that they can continue investing in their businesses, and the recent pop in prices is likely to reassure businesses that the coast is clear.

Second, the US is projected to run a budget deficit totalling roughly 12% of GDP this year, with billions of dollars in stimulus checks, lots of credit to keep businesses from shuttering (including PPP loan/grants and Fed lending programs), and big top-ups to weekly unemployment insurance checks.

If businesses don't actually shutter thanks to PPP and other programs, and if consumers are being provided enough cash to spend when they're able, it's possible the economy can return to the pre-coronavirus trend; that's what a BlackRock analysis from April suggests will happen.

But the biggest way to ensure the US economy bounces back is further federal government action. More stimulus in the form of cash distributions to households would lead to higher demand that gives businesses a reason to invest more than they otherwise would, and state and local government budget holes can easily be filled by the federal government via new legislation.

A new relief package unveiled on Tuesday by House Democrats does much to fill the gap, offering more cash distributions to households and plugging holes in state and local government operating budgets.

Taking these steps would help sustain the trajectory of growth into a true V-shape that returns US output to the post-2008 trend or even better starts a path towards the higher, post-war trend which we've been below for so long",real

Moderna's chief financial officer Lorence Kim and chief medical officer Tal Zaks dumped the staggering value of stocks on Monday and Tuesday when the share price skyrocketed following the company's announcement of what it described as 'positive' results from its vaccine trial.

The two executives pocketed almost $25 million in profits in a day's work before experts cast doubt on the vaccine's success and sent shares tumbling.

Kim exercised 241,000 options for $3 million Monday, then instantly sold them for $19.8 million, taking a tidy profit of $16.8 million, SEC filings seen by CNN Business show.

On Tuesday, Zaks exercised $1.5 million stock options before making a profit of $8.2 million when he immediately offloaded them for $9.77 million.

Stocks in Moderna surged as much as 30 percent Monday to $87 a share, after it released promising results of its COVID-19 vaccine trial

Moderna's chief financial officer Lorence Kim (left) and chief medical officer Tal Zaks (right) dumped the staggering value of stocks on Monday and Tuesday when the share price skyrocketed following the company's announcement over its vaccine trial

The biotech company released results from its COVID-19 vaccine trial Monday, after it became the first US company to start a clinical trial for a vaccine back in March.

This sparked hope that a vaccine for the deadly virus could make it to market by January and sent Wall Street investors into overdrive.

Stocks in Moderna surged as much as 30 percent Monday to $87 a share, and the company's market value climbed to $29 billion.

While investors raced to get a slice of the firm, the two insiders CFO Kim and CMO Zaks dumped the near-$30 million of shares between them on Monday and Tuesday.

According to filings, Kim also offloaded stocks in the days before the results of the trial were announced, selling 20,000 shares worth $1.3 million on May 15.

The timing of the sales may appear suspicious but Moderna insisted this week's sales from the two insiders were executed under automated insider trading plans, known as 10b5-1 plans.

Such plans lay out future stock trades at set prices or on set dates, with transactions typically being carried out without the insiders taking any action.

'These transactions are executing automatically pursuant to these trading plans,' the company said.

Experts have said this means the deals are perfectly legal.

Andrew Gordon, director of research services at Equilar, told CNN Business the executives' actions would only pose a 'legal issue if they created or modified their 10b5-1 plan while in possession of material insider information.

'It's not uncommon for insiders to sell shares they own, nor is it bad for them to capitalize on the current stock price.'

The company's share price wavered more as the week went on as the medical community gave a mixed response to the apparent success of the vaccine trials.

The company's share price wavered more as the week went on as the medical community gave a mixed response to the success of the vaccine trials. Dr Fauci called the trials 'optimistic'

Health website Stat cast doubt on the vaccine Tuesday, saying not enough information was available to understand if the phase one trial was a success and sending shares down to $71.67 that day.

Shares fell further to a low of $67.05 Thursday, down 16 percent from its Monday close.

Other experts have also voiced their skepticism over the trials.

Peter Hotez, a vaccine scientist at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, told Nature.com he was 'not convinced' by Moderna's claims.

'I'm not convinced that this is really a positive result,' Hotez said.

Shares then went up again Friday to $68.60 after Dr Anthony Fauci, the federal government's top immunologist, said he was 'cautiously optimistic' about Moderna's vaccine.

'Although the numbers were limited, it was quite good news because it reached and went over an important hurdle in the development of vaccines. That's the reason why I'm cautiously optimistic about it,' Fauci said at a CNN town hall on Thursday.

The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which Fauci is head of, is developing the vaccine in collaboration with Moderna.

Dr. Carlos del Rio, an Emory University professor of medicine which is testing Moderna's vaccine, echoed Fauci's optimism in an interview with CNBC Friday.

'I am cautiously optimistic. We are developing at a pace that has never been done before,' he said.

Moderna's phase one study of 45 participants and measuring the antibodies in eight participants found all eight had developed antibodies to the virus at levels at or above the antibodies found in people who have recovered from COVID-19

'Trying to think that, a year after a virus has been identified, we will have a vaccine ready to deploy and ready to go into massive distribution, it's simply mind-boggling to me.

'I have to be a little cautious and say I hope it happens, but I don't want to be - I want to make sure we do it the right way.'

Moderna's phase one study of 45 participants and measuring the antibodies in eight participants found all eight had developed antibodies to the virus at levels at or above the antibodies found in people who have recovered from COVID-19, the company revealed.

It expects to enter phase two trials with 600 participants soon and phase three trials in July.",fake
1961,https://theduran.com/dr-fauci-taken-to-task-as-covid-19-narrative-swings-wildly-again-video/,2020-05-23,Dr. Fauci taken to task as COVID-19 narrative swings wildly – again [Video],"Anybody who has been following the story about the coronavirus pandemic is hopefully aware of the constantly changing double, triple, quadruple and n-speak that the “experts” give us concerning the need for social distancing, wearing masks, not touching each other, and in America, especially about not being together in “non essential” places like… church. All of this has been more or less led and spurred on by one Dr. Anthony Fauci. We reported three weeks ago on some rather amazing accounts suggesting that this doctor was somehow connected to the research programs in a “chimeric virus” containing strains of SARS, HIV and other goodies to produce a supervirus – one that is incurable. That research program was ongoing in the United States before the government got wind of it and shut it down, rightly so, since it was a program designed to bring about nothing but death. However, the allegation goes, Fauci managed to channel money illegally to Wuhan, China, to a lab there to further the research, and it is that virus, the causal agent of COVID-19, that we all have come to know and roundly hate.

So goes the allegation. It seems like wackadoo conspiracy theory still to me, but there is some interesting detail behind it, so it is possible that there are at least several true elements. However, Dr Fauci works for President Trump on the Coronavirus Task Force, and of late, the President has been ignoring the good doctor’s “for your own good” advice more and more. On Friday, May 22, the doctor did a reversal from his long-held course that we must be isolated until the end of time (and our media controlled) and suggested that isolation for too long may do “irreperable harm… including to our own health.”

Yeah. We knew that already. Ask anyone who has been riding this thing out in their home for the last two months. Do you feel better now? Now, granted, we have done a lot to adapt to the present pandemic, but the rhetorical churn and froth over how this is being handled, and how and what the virus itself does is such that for the last week or two, it has been extremely difficult to know what to report on here. The only constant about COVID-19 seems to be the never-ending stream of unqualified nonsense (we have stronger words for that, you know) that have everyone who tries to stay informed jumping and paranoid… or, has them finally coming to the conclusion that seems to be true:

Nobody really knows.

It would be okay if someone, anyone, in leadership said this honestly and continuously, as a preface for trying to establish some sort of common ground. We know less about COVID-19 than the experts act like, and the increasingly political nature of the handling of the pandemic is far more dramatic than the pandemic itself has turned out to be.

The video included with this article shows the response of one entertainer, Dave Portnoy, who has been skeptical of Dr Fauci’s position for a long time. After Dr. Fauci suddenly whipsawed to a different point of view (in truly Orwellian splendor, without acknowledging he was wrong), Dave does not let him get away with it.

If nothing else, the video ought to help all of us blow off some long-built-up steam.

Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti lambasted US President Donald Trump on Thursday for appearing in public outside of the White House while not wearing a face mask.

Speaking to MSNBC host Andrea Mitchell, Garcetti was asked about Trump's avoidance of protective face covering.

Garcetti responded saying ""he's our commander in chief"" and that ""real men wear face masks”.

The LA mayor stressed that wearing masks is a gateway to ""increasing freedom"" and increased ""economic activity"", adding said that ""modeling"" the use of protective face covering is important for leaders.

For the past two weeks, Nathan Tetreault of Lillian, Ala., has suffered through likely COVID-19 symptoms: dry cough, fever, waking up in the middle of the night struggling to breathe.

""I don't know if I have it. However, chances are pretty darn likely,"" Tetreault says.

Doctors wouldn't test him last week because he didn't meet the required criteria early on: He's not someone who's over 65 and showing symptoms, and he hasn't traveled outside the U.S. or come into contact with anyone he knows of who has tested positive.

National Coronavirus Testing Capacity Remains A Problem Nationwide Coronavirus Testing Capacity Remains A Problem Nationwide Listen · 7:30 7:30

""The scariest thing is not getting answers, not knowing what's gonna happen when you call the doctor and they're just like, 'Yeah, you're on your own,' "" he says.

Tetreault is now feeling better. He's supposed to go back to his job at a supermarket. But he's worried he could be infectious. He says if he knew he was positive, he could ask for more time off.

There's still a serious shortage of testing for COVID-19 across the U.S., in spite of President Trump insisting the situation is improving. While COVID-19 testing criteria can vary depending on where you live, tests are being rationed in every state. Demand is far outstripping capacity from Alabama to Oregon.

In Portland, Ore., Melissa Burgess, her husband and their 1 1/2-year-old son have been holed up in their small house for two weeks. She had mild symptoms. Her husband, though, got much sicker — but not bad enough to go to the emergency room or get a test, according to their doctor.

Fortunately, his health is improving.

""And so maybe it wasn't that, and thank God, but the anxiety in the past few days has been pretty high,"" Burgess says.

Still, Burgess isn't taking any chances. She wears the family's one mask — they got it from a neighbor — when she cares for her husband. They're worried that if she gets sick, there will be nobody to take care of their son. Her parents live nearby and usually they'd help out, but they can't come over and risk getting sick.

""The point being, if everyone was able to just get a test, to know if they had it or not, then we could at least have comfort in knowing that someone could take care of our son,"" Burgess says.

People who responded to NPR's call-out on social media were frustrated that testing is still being rationed and not everyone who's showing symptoms can get one.

Betsy Larrabee of Longmont, Colo., said her husband is sick with many symptoms of COVID-19. Their son has leukemia, and yet their doctor said the only thing they could do for now is to isolate at home.

""How is that sound medical advice? Especially with a highly contagious disease, once both parents go down with it,"" she says. ""We had no choice but to expose our kids and pray for the best.""

There are signs that testing is becoming more widely available, with some caveats.

Idaho's Blaine County, home to the Sun Valley Resort, has reported some of the highest rates of COVID-19 in the United States. A woman there in her 30s was able to get tested. But because she wasn't that sick, her swab was sent to a commercial lab. She got the positive result 12 days later.

""We've never had sufficient test capacity from the beginning of this ordeal,"" says Abner King, CEO of Syringa Hospital & Clinics in rural northern Idaho.

Most of its tests are sent to a commercial lab in California, which has its own backlog to deal with.

""We have a lot of people that want to get tested and that are upset when the screening criteria says, no, you don't qualify to get tested,"" King says. ""They'll literally go to the next hospital down the road and try there, but we're all in the same boat.""

King just hopes people in his community who think they might be sick are heeding Idaho's stay-at-home order. That's not of much solace to people such as Melissa Burgess and her family next door in Oregon.

Burgess, however, stresses that she lays no blame on local physicians and health care staff.

""They are working so hard,"" she says. ""They're in a hard position to have to tell people, no, we can't prescribe you a test right now because there aren't enough.""",real
22,https://www.worldhealth.net/news/next-frontier-mitochondrial-medical-applications-2020/,2020-02-19,The Next Frontier of Mitochondrial Medical Applications (2020),"Becoming the world's most advanced and largest professional mitochondrial technology and manufacturing leader is the vision of most biotech companies in the field of mitochondria and mitochondrial research, and preventive medicine.

Mitochondrial disorders are multi-systemic and commonplace, and it belongs to a prevalent category of inherited neurometabolic diseases (prevalence: 1:4300). Such diseases are clinically, genetically and chemically heterogeneous so that recognition and diagnosis are frequently difficult, but thankfully, for most of the patients, recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has led to great improvements in genetic diagnosis. Due to the variability of features and nature of the biochemical or genetic defects, early referral to a specialized center is recommended because improved diagnostics and NGS use have enabled an earlier diagnosis for many, as well as sometimes early instigation of effective therapy and precision medicine.

There is currently no cure available for the majority of such conditions, and clinical care is largely restricted to negating the complications of these diseases or assisting prevention through prenatal testing, mitochondrial donation therapy and preimplantation genetic diagnosis. As such, the limited options and lack of curative treatment options have created more opportunities and investments into individual therapy trials, focused on optimizing oxidative phosphorylation and improving antioxidant capacity. In essence, a combination of vitamins, including coenzyme Q10 (ubiquinone), thiamine and riboflavin in addition to other regenerative medicinal approaches in the telomeres, stem cell and senescent cells is recommended. As of February 2020, more than 250 trials are ongoing worldwide investigating potential therapeutic approaches.

Mitochondrion Application Biomedicine Inc. (MAB or MitoBioMed) is one such company conducting such trials and aims to fulfil this mission by forming a strong competitive team with our medical institutions and customers, as a long-term and trusted technology and capacity provider in the global mitochondrial /cell therapy industry. Scientists are working night and day, racing to find a cure for the novel coronavirus. An East-meets-West combination of medicines is now suggested to be the recommended course.

With the advent of an ageing society, many studies in the past ten years have shown that mitochondria are closely related to ageing and degenerative diseases (such as neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, etc). This is because when mitochondrial function is abnormal, it will trigger a lack of energy supply and oxidative stress, and even induce cells to enter apoptosis or autophagy, which will cause disease.

MAB also establishes a series of training and certification mechanisms for medical personnel (such as doctors) and cooperates with medical institutions and academic institutions around the world. This makes it a prime candidate for impact investing towards sustainability development, in alignment with the United Nations and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

The Company along with other biotech companies in the field have developed many product lines, including mitochondrial activated stem cells (Mitocell), mitochondrial biologics (Mitobio), mitochondrial activated immune cells (MAKcell), mitochondrial function tests (Mitoscan), mitochondrial aesthetic medicine, mitochondrial cell bank(Mitobank), mitochondria activated herbal extracts (Dynamito), mitochondria activated health food (Mitofood), mitochondria activation culture medium(Stemoto), etc., Mitocell, Mitobio, and MAKcell are all ready for the next phase of clinical development. Other products are cooperatively sold in the fields of preventive health care, medical beauty, cell culture, detection and analysis. These products have proven safety and effectiveness in preliminary studies.

Furthermore, Mitochondria for stem cell therapy is another frontier for regenerative medicine. Stem cells are primitive and unspecialized cells, they are a type of cells that are not sufficiently differentiated and have the potential to regenerate various tissues and organs. In medicine, stem cells have long been considered to have potential for medical applications because of their strong potential for treating physical damage caused by disease, aging, genetic factors or trauma. In international research, mitochondria are an important factor affecting the quality of stem cells. By analyzing the function of mitochondria in stem cells as a way to identify the quality of cells, it provides a scientific way to identify cell quality. The company's research is to improve the quality and function of stem cells by screening and increasing mitochondrial function. Stem cells activated by mitochondria have better therapeutic effects. Our company's mitochondrial activated stem cells have also been proven to be useful in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, Osteoarthritis, Multiple System Atrophy

Lastly, in addition to the aforementioned products in the market, mitochondrial replacement techniques (MRT) work to prevent transmitting mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) diseases from mother to the next generation. Such diseases vary in presentation and severity. The goal of MRT is to prevent the transmission of such diseases by creating an embryo with nuclear DNA (nDNA) from the intended mother and mtDNA from a woman with non-pathogenic mtDNA through modification of either an oocyte (egg) or zygote (fertilized egg). This will help alleviate common symptoms including developmental delays, seizures, weakness and fatigue, muscle weakness, vision loss, and heart problems, which in combination lead to an increase of morbidity and in some cases premature death. While research continues to be conducted, if effective, MRT could satisfy the desire of women seeking to have a genetically related child without the risk of passing on mtDNA disease.

In the US alone, mitochondrial diseases affect around 1 in 5,000 individuals. It is also estimated that 1,000-4,000 children are born with a mitochondrial disease every year Therefore, there is a direct need to focus on building a world class professional mitochondrial technology and manufacturing leader, with a purpose in creating affordable healthcare and biotech leadership in preventative medicine. It also creates a space for the community of social impact investing to be more deeply involved in health and wellbeing.",fake
458,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ford-general-motors-coronavirus-ventilators-medical-supplies/,2020-04-27,How Ford and GM joined the fight against the coronavirus,"This past week another 4.4 million Americans joined the unemployment line, and among the companies shedding the most workers are America's carmakers. The ""big two"" – General Motors and Ford – built nearly 4 million vehicles here in America last year, today they are making exactly zero; their factories closed to prevent the coronavirus from spreading among employees.

While they are no longer making cars, both GM and Ford are applying their manufacturing muscle to the pandemic by turning out ventilators and personal protective equipment in huge numbers. Last week we spoke to GM CEO Mary Barra and Ford executive chairman Bill Ford remotely, both of them were in Michigan, and they told us they're thinking creatively to figure out how to get their workers back on the line and keep them there.

Bill Ford: We're shut down pretty much everywhere in the world except China right now. And then, of course, we were shut down in China earlier. And we've never had a time like this where everything has been shut.



Norah O'Donnell: I know that Ford reports its first quarter earnings in a few days and the projection is a loss of $2 billion. And those losses will continue to mount. Can you sustain that?

Bill Ford: Well, obviously, not indefinitely.

Between them, Ford and General Motors had nearly $300 billion in revenue last year. Today, that river of money is running dry.

Mary Barra is CEO of GM, the first woman to run the company in its history.

Norah O'Donnell: Has COVID-19 proved to be an existential threat to GM's long-term health?

Mary Barra: Between the strength of our balance sheet with the steps we've taken in the past, we will get through this and we will learn a lot of lessons that we'll apply.

Norah O'Donnell: I mean, what's the long-term prognosis for-- for General Motors if you're not making cars?

Mary Barra: No one knows-- when things are going to get back to what I refer to as a new normal. I've heard others refer to it as the new abnormal.

Mary Barra, CEO of GM

In the ""new abnormal,"" GM and Ford have each tapped into about $15 billion in private lines of credit to pay their bills. One estimate is that Ford is burning through $165 million dollars a day. Remember, it was just 11 years ago, in the last financial crisis, that GM declared bankruptcy. Ford avoided that, but did get a $6 billion government loan.

Norah O'Donnell: So do you think you'll need another loan to get through this crisis?

Bill Ford: We don't think so. We think we can get through this. And we think we can get through it and get back to work. But we're in an unprecedented time. And so I suppose you never say never. But that's not our plan.

Part of the financial pressure is that under their contracts with the United Auto Workers union, Ford and GM continue to pay millions of dollars to their idled workers.

And now there's political pressure, with protests taking place in their home state of Michigan, and some demonstrators demanding an economic restart.

Norah O'Donnell: What do you think's driving those protests?

Bill Ford: I think people are-- are understandably nervous, scared-- scared about the disease, but also scared about their own economic well being. And so I mean I get it. I totally get it.

Norah O'Donnell: Many people in your state want to get back to work soon.

Bill Ford: Well, I think we'd all like to get back to work soon. But we have to do it safely. And that's not a political question. That's really a scientific question.

Bill Ford

As Ford and GM shut down auto production in March, Michigan emerged as a major COVID-19 hot spot. The state has the third largest number of deaths in the nation, and its health care workers have endured shortages of protective gear. The state's largest health system, Beaumont, says that 1,500 of its employees are presumed to have COVID-19.

Norah O'Donnell: What were your marching orders to your team when this crisis began?

Bill Ford: My team didn't need marching orders. Right from the very start, it was from our local hospital saying, ""Hey, we don't have any protective equipment, who can help us,"" our company just jumped into action.

And that began Ford's transformation from carmaker to medical supply manufacturer. The company has since churned out millions of face shields, masks, gowns, and portable respirators for health care workers. This past week, ford began producing ventilators for patients.

Bill Ford: There are companies that can make complicated things, but they make them in small numbers. There are also companies that can make lots of things, but they can't make complicated things. You know, we turn out an F-150 every 52 seconds. So when we look at this crisis-- as a country and said, you know, ""Which industry is positioned to help us not only in terms of sophisticated machinery, but can do a lotta them and a lotta them quickly,"" the auto industry is uniquely positioned to do that.

In mid-March, it looked as if American hospitals would quickly need thousands of ventilators that didn't exist.

As the pandemic spread, GM's Mary Barra learned about a small innovative ventilator manufacturer in Washington state called Ventec.

Norah O'Donnell: Was putting the company's assets and people to work, to fight this pandemic an easy decision?

Mary Barra: It was a very easy decision. When I got the call and we got the introduction to Ventec the team just moved so quickly. And we thought if there's a way we can help, we absolutely want to do it.

After one phone call with Ventec, Phil Kienle, GM's vice president of North American manufacturing, got on a plane with three of his engineers.

Phil Kienle

Phil Kienle: When we were on the flight to Seattle, I asked everybody to have a mindset of what if your parents, your wife, one of your children had this COVID disease, and absolutely needed one of these ventilators? How far would you go to get this thing into production? How fast would you move?

Norah O'Donnell: And given the speed with which you needed to act, how did you go about sourcing 400 different parts for ventilators?

Phil Kienle: Our global purchasing and supply chain team really pulled off a miracle in sourcing this. We were in Seattle on a Friday. That same weekend, they were already sourcing the components for us.

GM and Ventec began transforming GM's Kokomo, Indiana, facility virtually overnight, from one that made electronic car components to a ventilator factory. It was ideally suited because both products contain a lot of circuit boards.

Then they called on a mixture of salaried GM employees and union workers from the UAW.

George Vandermeir

George Vandermeir has been with GM for 43 years. He used to make sure parts for pickup trucks met safety standards. He's doing the same now for ventilators, with parts so small they need to be picked up with a set of tweezers.

Norah O'Donnell: When were you scheduled to retire?

George Vandermeir: Yesterday. So I just extended my retirement for another month or two just to make sure this gets off the ground and everything works well so we can get these ventilators out.

Tracy Streeter used to move sheet metal with a forklift at his old GM job. That was before he was laid off because of COVID-19.

Tracy Streeter: And just brought that plant to a standstill.

He is one of 46 laid-off workers from a GM plant in Marion, Indiana, who got the call from Kokomo.

Tracy Streeter: I went and asked my wife. She's an LPN. And her eyes lit up and she went, ""You get to help."" So it was a no-brainer.

Norah O'Donnell: Your wife is a nurse and she said, ""This is an opportunity to help.""

Tracy Streeter: Exactly.

Tracy Streeter

In just two days he was trained to assemble and test a part of the ventilator that holds oxygen and has to be airtight.

Tracy Streeter: There's a little tiny screw that goes into-- the part that I build. But even though that screw is so small, it's an important part. I look at it in the scheme of things, I'm just probably just as insignificant as that small little screw. But I play a part in what's happening in the bigger scale.

Phil Kienle: It went from a discussion to production in less than three weeks.

At first, GM and Ventec were operating on their own. In late March, President Trump ordered them to make ventilators under the Defense Production Act. Twelve days later they signed a half-billion dollar contract to make 30,000 for the federal government by August.

GM says it's not making any profit on the ventilators, but the project is teaching the company valuable lessons to help get its car factories open faster, says Phil Kienle, head of manufacturing for North America.

Phil Kienle: Well, we've actually pretty much used-- Kokomo as a beta site, if you will, for new safety protocols that we'll instill when General Motors restarts.

Norah O'Donnell: That's really interesting. So not only are you making ventilators, you're also learning about how to work safely in this new era once you reopen the car plants.

Phil Kienle: Absolutely.

Norah O'Donnell: Many of those working on Kokomo, Mary, told us that they get their temperature taken before they go into work. Is that going to be the new normal in American manufacturing?

Mary Barra: Yes it will be. And before I walked into this facility today I had my temperature scanned. I think it's-- a very important part of the protocol.

Bill Ford: In the plant I'm in today-- we're wearing face masks and we're wearing face shields.

Ford's executive chairman, Bill Ford, says the company has also installed plastic barriers between each workstation to enforce social distancing.

Bill Ford: Everybody's also wearing watches that buzz if you get within six feet of somebody else.

Norah O'Donnell: That's the first I had heard about these wristbands that buzz when you get within six feet of somebody.

Bill Ford: Yeah, we're trying it out.

The watches that Ford is testing are made by Samsung and use bluetooth technology.

Bill Ford: It also tells you who you've come into contact with that's also been wearing that-- that-- wristband, so that if anybody was infected, it's very easy to trace who they were interacting with.

Ford is testing the watches with small teams of workers now making medical equipment.

Norah O'Donnell: And what do you do when it buzzes?

Joanne Ritchie: Back off. (LAUGH)

Joanne Ritchie

30-year Ford employee Joanne Ritchie is on a line that's made over a million face masks. Just six weeks ago, in another ""clean room,"" she was making transmission valves.

Joanne's daughter, Andrea is a critical care nurse in one of the hospitals near Detroit that has seen both shortages of protective gear and multiple staffers diagnosed with COVID-19.

Norah O'Donnell: And when your manager called to ask if you would come back not to make cars, but to make face masks, did you think about your daughter and helping her?

Joanne Ritchie: That was the first thing that came to my mind. I thought, ""I'm gonna protect her. If I can, I'm gonna protect her. I'm gonna give her what she needs to do her job.""

Joanne Ritchie goes to her job at the factory every morning at 4:30 a.m., seven days a week. About an hour after she leaves for work, her daughter heads for her job at the hospital, to treat COVID-19 patients.

Joanne Ritchie: The first couple days that she came home, she was-- you couldn't even look at her in the face. She didn't wanna talk. And I says, ""I'm worried about you. I'm-- I'm waiting to make sure that you come home at night (CRYING) 'cause I don't know if you're gonna come home.""

Norah O'Donnell: She really is on the frontlines.

Joanne Ritchie: Oh yeah, she is. Sorry about that. (LAUGH)

Turns out, it runs in the family. During World War II, Joanne's grandmother, Chiara worked for the Hudson Motor Car Company in Detroit, helping to make planes and engines for the U.S. war machine, just as millions of other women did in factories all around the country.

Norah O'Donnell: Your grandmother Chiara was a real Rosie the Riveter.

Joanne Ritchie: Yes, she was. You just step up to the plate.

GM's George Vandermeir also stepped up. The first shipments of ventilators he helped build went out to Chicago area hospitals last week.

Norah O'Donnell: When you first saw a ventilator built and completed, ready to ship, how did that make you feel?

George Vandermeir: It was amazing. What we could do in such a short period of time, taking a vision and making it reality in three or four works. And we all got that opportunity to sign the box of the first shipments.

Norah O'Donnell: Worth putting retirement off for?

George Vandermeir: Absolutely. Hands down, no question.

During a recent webcast, O'Keefe discussed two stock picks he finds attractive in light of the market turmoil.

Southwest Airlines' strong balance sheet gives the carrier an edge over its peers, while UBS is better exposed to high-quality credit, he said.

Click here for more BI Prime stories.

Market crashes are no fun for the fund managers whose holdings shrink in value.

But for value investors specifically, every one of these episodes is an opportunity to find downtrodden companies that become much cheaper compared with their long-term prospects.

This is yet another reason that stock pickers like Daniel O'Keefe prefer their approach over the alternative that buys index and exchange-traded funds.

The Artisan International Value Fund he comanages looks for stocks the market is underpricing relative to their intrinsic or cash-flow-derived value. It has returned more than 6% over the past 15 years, double the performance of its category, according to Morningstar data.

In light of the coronavirus crisis and its impact on market valuations, O'Keefe singled out three of his holdings that have attractive value propositions.

For starters, he is not giving up on US airlines even after Warren Buffett, a godfather of value investing, liquidated his stake in the battered industry.

O'Keefe's fund first bought Southwest Airlines in the first quarter as the pandemic halted most travel. And as an indication of the low-cost carrier's ascendancy, its stock has held up better than every other US airline this year even though it is down 55%.

O'Keefe said one characteristic that should give Southwest an edge going forward is its balance sheet, which includes nearly $4 billion in cash.

""They have the enormous financial resources to survive what I think most people would agree is a temporary and anomalous situation,"" he said during a recent webcast hosted by Ariel Investments.

The airline's other advantages include its exclusively domestic itineraries and extensive network of low-cost flights, he added.

Not every airline with these characteristics may be able to survive the crisis. O'Keefe pointed to Boeing CEO David Calhoun' prediction that a major US airline could go bust this year amid the coronavirus pandemic.

""That will be of enormous benefit to Southwest,"" O'Keefe said, adding, ""They are in the best position to take market share when the others are clearly impaired.""

The second distinctive opportunity he identified is across the pond and in a completely different industry. UBS was the sixth-largest holding in his global value portfolio as of March 31.

He views it as a cheap stock that has undeservedly been painted with the same brush as the rest of the European banking industry.

""It's a wealth-management business,"" O'Keefe said. ""Yes, it has the investment bank. But it's a fairly de-risked investment bank over the last 10 years.""

He added that UBS as a whole did not have as much low-credit exposure as some of its peers. The majority of its credit exposure is to wealthy clients and includes so-called Lombard loans that are secured against a portfolio of liquid assets.

""If you don't want to own a bank, but you want to benefit from the undervaluation of banks, something like UBS is really interesting,"" O'Keefe said.",real

The European Union may start offering financial support to companies hard hit by coronavirus that are not able to receive financial assistance from their home governments, EU Economic Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni told Handelsblatt.

“This is important for pan-European value chains, for example in the car industry. If one link fails there, all the others are affected,” said the official, who also served as Italian prime minister from 2016 to 2018.

The measure would come as an additional instrument to the existing reconstruction plan that will be presented next week, the commissioner noted. On Monday, the EU’s two biggest economies, France and Germany, proposed to establish a 500-billion-euro Recovery Fund that would help corona-hit industries with financial grants. Some EU states, including Germany, believe that this support should come under the condition that its recipients, such as Italy, would first implement certain reforms. Former Italian PM Gentiloni, however, said during the interview that he did not believe that there was any “conditionality” around the financial assistance.

The emergency plan may turn out to be much more costly in the end, according to recent reports. It has been criticised by certain EU members in the north, including Austria, whose chancellor has recently argued that the most corona-affected countries should be helped by “loans” rather than simple grants.

The two-country initiative was still welcomed by many EU nationals and officials, including President of the European Council Charles Michel, but many social media users and tax payers remained sceptical regarding the proposal.

736,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nih-cancelled-coronavirus-research-grant-60-minutes-2020-05-10/,2020-05-10,Why it matters that the NIH canceled a coronavirus research grant,"When 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley recently sought to report on the origin of the novel coronavirus sweeping the globe, producer Ashley Velie pointed him to Dr. Peter Daszak, a disease ecologist whose work in sampling and researching coronaviruses in wildlife has helped identify potentially dangerous emerging diseases in humans. It turns out Pelley had previously reported on Daszak and was familiar with his research into how coronaviruses—such as the one causing COVID-19—move from bats to humans.

But this time, Daszak's story took an unexpected turn. Shortly after Pelley finished interviewing him last month about COVID-19's origin, the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) abruptly canceled a five-year, $3.7 million grant supporting his research. Pelley and Velie had a new story to report and returned to Daszak for a second interview.

Several U.S. officials, including Florida Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz, had raised suspicions about the Wuhan Institute of Virology, one of Daszak's key collaborators in China. When a reporter mischaracterized key details of the NIH grant during a White House press conference last month, President Trump said he would check if any U.S. funds had been granted to the Wuhan Institute, and if so, he said, they would immediately be terminated.

But the $3.7 million grant was not given to the Wuhan Institute. It had been awarded to Daszak's New York-based organization, EcoHealth Alliance. A week after President Trump said the funds would be terminated in China, the NIH took action against EcoHealth Alliance, giving the organization no reason for the grant's termination. Ending an NIH grant usually requires a full investigation and proof of an egregious action like scientific or financial fraud—neither of which applied to EcoHealth Alliance.

Fellow scientists have spoken out about the unsettling precedent the NIH set. ""This is cutting off your face to spite your nose,"" Gerald Keusch, a former director of NIH's Fogarty International Center, told Science. ""This is the worst kind of thing that political interference can cause in a democracy.""

Recognizing the ramifications of NIH's decision involves understanding of the scope of Daszak's work—and its impact on future coronavirus pandemics.

Pelley and 60 Minutes first met Daszak for a 2004 report. At the time, scientists were still trying to determine the origin of the coronavirus that had caused a global outbreak of SARS, and ecologists like Daszak were among the virus hunters on the case.

For this earlier report, Pelley traveled to Malaysia, where Daszak and a colleague were trying to find the source of another deadly virus, Nipah, which had killed 40 percent of the people it infected. The ecologists eventually traced the virus to bats, which ate the fruit from trees farmers had planted over their pigsties for shade. Pigs then ate bits of tainted fruit the bats had dropped near them.

But even as he was trying to figure out how Malaysian pig farmers had contracted Nipah, Daszak had his eye on future outbreaks.

""What worries me the most is that we are going to miss the next emerging disease,"" Daszak told Pelley at the time, ""that we're suddenly going to find a SARS virus that moves from one part of the planet to another, wiping out people as it moves along.""

From the archives: Hunting viruses

As part of his efforts to predict and prevent future pandemics, Daszak subsequently became president of EcoHealth Alliance, which researches where pandemics come from and how to stop them. Much of his work involves bats, which have become breeding grounds for deadly viruses.

As Daszak explained to 60 Minutes, no one knows for sure why bats are such adept hosts for disease, but one theory is that bats are the only mammal naturally capable of sustained flight. Flying, Daszak explains, burns a lot of oxygen and puts a lot of stress on bats' cells. As a result, their immune system kicks in.

""Bats can't live with that sort of immune response all the time, so they dampen down their immune response. That's been shown,"" Daszak said. ""And in dampening down their own immunity, they allow viruses to proliferate. So bats carry a higher amount of virus and a higher diversity of viruses than other mammals.""

Bats, Daszak and a team of international scientists discovered, were the origin of the 2003 SARS outbreak. While scientists do not yet know the origin species of COVID-19, the closest match has been found in a bat coronavirus in China's Yunnan province that shared 96 percent of its genetic material with the virus that's known to cause COVID-19.

As hunting for virus origins shows, partnerships with scientists around the world are key. Daszak's EcoHealth Alliance has worked for years with the Wuhan Institute, and together they've catalogued hundreds of bat viruses, including dozens of previously unknown coronaviruses. The antiviral medication Remdesivir, the only drug so far proven to help patients with COVID-19, was initially tested against the viruses Daszak and his team had discovered under previous funding from the NIH.

Daszak said EcoHealth Alliance had been spending about $100,000 a year collaborating with the Wuhan Institute.



""I can't just show up in China and say, 'Hi, I want to work on your viruses,'"" he said. ""I have to do this through the correct channels. So, what we do is we talk to NIH, and they approve the people we can work with in China. And that happened. And our collaboration with Wuhan was preapproved by NIH.""

Last year, the NIH reauthorized EcoHealth's five-year grant after independent scientists reviewed the application. According to Daszak, EcoHealth's grant received a high-priority score and was in the top three percent of grants the NIH reviewed last year.

The NIH would not tell 60 Minutes why EcoHealth Alliance's grant was canceled or whether anything like it had happened before.

Daszak says the consequence of NIH pulling the $3.7 million grant will be felt for years to come.

""It matters because number one, our work is used in developing vaccines and drugs to save American lives and the lives of people around the world. So that matters a lot,"" Daszak said. ""Number two, if we really want to know where viruses are going to emerge and cause the next pandemic, we need to have scientific collaborations like this. They're our only eyes and ears on the ground in countries that are very difficult, for political reasons, to work in.""

""We are the frontline of preventing the next pandemic,"" he said. ""And we need to get on with our job.""

Some business shifts seem like natural moves — restaurants offering takeout, venues livestreaming concerts or retailers scaling up online sales.

Businesses that are based around gathering people together for a tour, a game, travel or a conference are finding new ways to get money coming in the door.

Milwaukee Food & City Tours can't load up buses of strangers to take them on a tour of Milwaukee these days. Stay-at-home orders and social distancing requirements make it nearly impossible. Even with the easing of restrictions, it's unknown when the general public will feel comfortable gathering again.

The company started receiving phone calls for cancellations as soon as President Donald Trump declared a national emergency. By the next day, more than $200,000 in business was canceled or refunded, said company owner Theresa Nemetz.

""Within 48 hours, I realized we were completely out of business unless we pivot,"" Nemetz said.

Can these stores survive?:Can these 13 retailers outlast coronavirus?

Lost Penney? J.C. Penney says it plans to close nearly 29% of stores – or 242 locations – as part of its bankruptcy

Coming up with a new line of business was the only way Nemetz could keep paying her five-person full-time staff and continue to call part-time workers.

The idea was to bring the sights and tastes of Milwaukee to customers' doors with care packages. Instead of taking people through the city for sausages at Usinger's and pretzels from Milwaukee Pretzel Co., Milwaukee Food & City Tours is packing those items up (along with virtual tour experience access) and shipping it out.

Milwaukee Food & City Tours started in late March with quarantine care kits and shelter-in-style kits.

Nearly 2,000 care packages have been sold. The move is sustaining Nemetz's business. She has not had to furlough staff members. She also received federals funds through the Paycheck Protection Program.

The selection has expanded with specialty care packages for events like birthdays, Mother's Day and Cinco De Mayo. The kits vary in price from around $35 for a chocolate self-care kit to $78 for the ultimate snack break.

Milwaukee Food & City Tours is thinking about offering tours again to private groups with guides leaving adequate distance and talking through headsets. But it's also thinking about how these care packages can become a lasting part of the business.

""For the next couple of years, it's possible that some individuals won't be able to do a tour,"" she said. Instead of having travelers visit Milwaukee to learn about the city, she'll ship the experience to them.

Marla Poytinger isn't sure when her company will be able to bring 1,500 people through her bars for ax throwing, mini-golf, shuffleboard and painting again on a Saturday night.

The live, host-led trivia game her company launched during the pandemic will remain part of Bars & Recreation Inc.'s business line after bars open.

""Even if the world goes back to normal, which I don’t think anyone expects, there is still a huge market of people who ... still need to gather and interact but can’t or aren't willing to come together physically,"" Poytinger said. Public games are $9 per registration, which can include all the people quarantined together.

The company, which runs Axe MKE, Splash Studio, NorthSouth Club and Nine Below, is seeing maybe just 1% of its normal revenue, she said.

Many businesses like hers would lose all their revenue unless a new product could be sold.

Daniel Cruz was launching his new laundry service for Airbnb hosts, Washbnb, as the pandemic halted travel. The company faced a total loss. Cruz thought about shutting down, but laundry still needs to get done, even during a pandemic.

Washbnb shifted gears to offering services to people who are elderly or immunocompromised in the Milwaukee community, charging around $10 to $20 a load with delivery. The company is also offering a pay-what-you-can model. It is operating at a loss and actively looking for investors to raise $450,000.

Nearly all the trade shows that BoothCentral Inc. works with to manage vendors are canceled for the foreseeable future.

""No events are collecting vendor payment,"" said BoothCentral co-founder Tim Gill. ""We had to pivot or we would be at a standstill.""

BoothCentral's development team built a new platform out in 10 days to replicate the experience of an in-person trade show. This is not just a live stream. The virtual event page contains a main livestream and vendor rooms, among other areas, with the goal to replicate the buzz of an in-person event.

It held its first virtual event in the middle of April.

""We didn't go into this thinking it would be extended this long,"" he said. ""But we just knew that we had to do something.""

On its new platform, BoothCentral is hosting art fairs, home and garden shows, and career fairs. The company is now growing and hiring to add to its staff of 10 employees. Even once in-person events are held again, BoothCentral anticipates hybrid models with online components.

""There is no going back to normal at this point,"" Gill said. ""We see that this is going to be the new way.""

Disney, Universal, SeaWorld, Busch Gardens and Legoland theme parks in Central Florida have presented reopening plans to local governments with proposed reopening dates or are preparing to do so in the coming days.

Theme parks in Florida, California and across the U.S. have been closed since mid-March or delayed their summer openings because of the global COVID-19 pandemic. No post-COVID-19 reopening dates have been set for Disney and Universal parks in California.

Florida’s Orange County Economic Recovery Task Force laid out preliminary plans for a phased reopening of theme parks in the Orlando area once the coronavirus crisis begins to wane. The Florida task force’s initial recommendations call for Disney World and Universal Orlando theme parks to reopen at 50% capacity in Phase 1 and at 75% in Phase 2.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has asked Florida theme park operators to submit formal reopening requests that have the support of local and county officials.

Universal Orlando’s proposal to reopen on June 3 was unanimously approved by a local county economic recovery task force on Thursday, May 21, according to NBC affiliate WESH-TV. Universal’s reopening plan must still be approved by county and state officials, according to WESH.

Universal’s plan calls for reopening its Florida theme parks to passholders on June 3 and 4 and to the general public on June 5.

Disney and SeaWorld are expected to make formal presentations to the Florida task force in the coming days, according to local Florida news outlets. Legoland Florida has presented a plan for reopening on June 1.

Recent movements by the major industry players have offered encouraging signs that the full reopening of Florida theme parks could be coming soon.

The Disney Springs and Universal CityWalk outdoor malls at the theme park resort properties have reopened in recent days with new health and safety protocols.

SeaWorld has conducted test runs with riders wearing protective face coverings on the Mako hypercoaster to make sure the masks won’t fly off during the 200-foot drop and 73 mph ride over 4,760 feet of track.

Disney World has come to terms with unions representing theme park employees on issues such as temperature checks, protective face masks and paid time off for Disney cast members who contract COVID-19, according to Motley Fool.

Legoland Florida’s plan to reopen on June 1 has received approval by city and county officials, according to the Lakeland Ledger, a local news organization.

The park’s reopening plan was submitted to DeSantis on Thursday, May 21, according to Legoland officials.

Legoland Florida proposes to reopen at 50% maximum capacity, admitting approximately 6,000 visitors per day, according to the Ledger.

Legoland’s reopening plan includes new protocols for increased sanitization and social distancing — even in parking lot spaces.

Temperature checks will be required of all visitors with the park baring anyone with a fever and their party. Protective masks will be highly recommended but not required with the park providing complimentary face coverings to visitors who don’t bring them. Park employees will be required to wear masks.

Online ticket purchases will be recommended but not required for Legoland Florida. Only cashless payments will be accepted in the park. Interactive play areas and character meet-and-greet photo opportunities will be temporarily discontinued. Self-service buffets, salad bars and soda fountains will be closed.

Legoland Florida’s new Pirate Island Hotel — originally scheduled to open in April — will open on June 1, according to the park.

SeaWorld Entertainment interim CEO Marc Swanson said he hoped to reopen SeaWorld Orlando in June during an industry and hospitality roundtable discussion this week, according to CBS affiliate WKMG-TV.

SeaWorld Entertainment — which operates SeaWorld Orlando and Busch Gardens Tampa in Florida — has submitted reopening plans to DeSantis, Swanson said at the roundtable meeting.

Upon approval, Swanson said park officials would be ready to reopen in June following two to four weeks to “ramp things up,” according to WKMG.

Less than two weeks later, on March 16, Carl's Golfland's two brick-and-mortar locations were effectively shut down because of the COVID-19 pandemic

""My life flipped on the 5th of March,"" said Carl Rose Jr., ""and it flipped again on the 16th.""

The two life-altering dates forever will be intertwined, as far as Junior is concerned, especially as he tries to make the best of a situation that's been rotten for millions of businesses throughout the nation and world.

Carl's Golfland has kept all 180 of its employees on the payroll, and has donated more than $350,000 to hospitals and charities, mostly in Southeast Michigan, but also some nationally.

It's all part of Rose's #ShankThisVirus Campaign, which drew national notoriety Sunday when he got a shoutout on NBC during golf's return-to-live-action charity exhibition featuring Rory McIlroy, Dustin Johnson, Rickie Fowler and Matthew Wolff. On Sunday morning, given his long-standing relationship with event sponsor TaylorMade, Rose decided to add a $100,000 donation to the exhibition's purse.

""Mom and Dad started this in 1958, the year I was born, and Southeast Michigan and the country has been so good to my family and my business. I've been very, very fortunate,"" Rose said over the phone Tuesday. ""It just felt right to me. My mother and father, I know what type of people they were, and how they would look at this, and it just felt right to me. I wanted to try and make a difference.

""I started thinking about what Mom and Dad would do. They were very generous people, even when they were small.

""We've all gotta help each other.""

Carl's Golfland has two shops, in Bloomfield Hills and Plymouth, which are among the most acclaimed golf-apparel outfits in the country.

They do huge business, particularly in the spring months, as Michigan's estimated half-million recreational golfers gear up for the season.

This year, though, the shops suffered significant financial damages, with the stores being forced closed since mid-March. Rose and his staff installed curbside pickups for online sales, but that only made up for about 15 percent of the typical business. It's popular Demo Days were canceled.

Only recently has Carl's Golfland been allowed to open its ranges and its fitting stations, and give lessons.

But Rose still made the commitment to keep his staff, and fund the charity, which in Michigan has helped Gleaners Food Bank, Detroit Public Safety Foundation, Henry Ford Health System, St. Joseph Mercy Oakland Hospital, Hurley Medical Center, DMC Detroit Receiving Hospital, SAY Detroit and the American Red Cross, plus a couple initiations outside the state, including the New York City Fire Department Foundation and The Beacon in Houston.

The donation during the NBC broadcast of the golf exhibition — one of the first live televised sporting events since mid-March, joining NASCAR, which returned Sunday — supports the American Nurses Foundation and CDC Foundation.

""We're banged up, we're bruised, and it's gonna be a while until we're not,"" Rose said. ""This is something that's gonna have repercussions for years to come.

""You get one bruise and that heals up, and you've got another one. But I think we're gonna be one of the lucky ones. My heart bleeds for many people in our country, businesses you know aren't gonna come back.""

Golfers can purchase a #ShankThisVirus t-shirt at carlsgolfland.com, with all proceeds — the entire $18 cost of the shirt — going to charity, thanks to Carl's Golfland, founded by Carl and Donna Rose as a small driving range in Pontiac.

Among notable golfers who have joined the #ShankThisVirus campaign are LPGA players Lexi Thompson, Morgan Pressel and Maria Fassi, and LPGA legend Annika Sorenstam.

Russia, however, started to build up its reserves long before the crisis emerged.

Russia has become a saviour of the global gold markets as the pandemic has spurred abnormally high demand for the precious metal while it has at the same time also crippled companies' ability to produce gold in the amounts requested by market players, the vice president of Russian gold industry giant Zolotoy Monetnyy Dom, Alexey Vyazovsky, says.

""When a pandemic or war emerges, gold is everyone's first choice to buy. But right now buying gold is problematic. Refineries where gold alloys are purified, mints where gold coins are minted, some banks and exchanges, all infrastructure, including even some mines are closed due to quarantine"", Vyazovsky says.

The gold expert explains that Russia mines some 300 tonnes of gold each year and has huge amounts of gold stashed in reserves - something that is now saving the market. Vyazovsky stresses that the Russian government has allowed companies to export gold, with the main flows of the precious metal now going to the two main European gold hubs - London and Switzerland - which were experiencing acute shortages of physical gold.

This situation turned out to be highly profitable for Russian gold companies, the expert notes.

""Gold prices are on the rise in Russia as it's traded in rubles. So now the gold-mining companies are getting incredible profits"", Vyazovsky says.

Russia has indeed been boosting its gold reserves for some time and started doing so long before the coronavirus pandemic hit the world. When Moscow started dumping its holdings of US Treasury bonds, it also started buying the precious metal, supposedly as a replacement for its dollar-nominated assets. In 2019, Russia became the biggest gold buyer in the world, closely followed by China.

A new bill has been introduced into the 116th Congress (2019-2020) of the U.S. House of Representatives named H.R.6666 - COVID-19 Testing, Reaching, And Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act, with the potential to further the loss of the already vanishing health freedoms of each and every citizen of the United States. You can stand with us today by opposing H.R.6666 now (use this link to Take A Stand)

H.R. 6666, despite having been introduced by Rep. Bobby L. Rush [D-IL-1] and referred to the Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on the same day almost two weeks ago on 5/01/2020, has received little mainstream media coverage to this date, other than recent attempts to debunk claims that it would further violate the rights of Americans. As of 5/14/2020 is has 59 co-sponsors, including one Republican, indicating the potential that it may gain greater bipartisan support unless strongly opposed.

H.R. 6666 authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Director of the CDC, to allocate a 100 billion dollars, annually (or until the national COVID emergency is declared over), to employ, train, and deploy an immense workforce of “testing and contact tracers” to be sent directly to everyone’s homes for diagnostic testing and tracing of contacts suspected to have been infected or are at risk of infection with COVID-19. The bill uses broad yet highly vague language to describe the role of this veritable army of new agents of the emerging U.S. medical police state “for other purposes,” such as “support the quarantine of such contacts.”

The nebulous language of H.R. 6666 affords the government and public and private grantees under its coordination unusually broad discretion to apply its newly granted police powers under the presently defined “national COVID health emergency.” Since the national lockdown began on March the 15th, we’ve witnessed the near complete suspension of most of our Constitutionally irrevocable civil liberties, with the near complete cessation and/or modification of all socio-economic activity within the country. Moreover, executive orders have already been enacted throughout this country enabling the forced seizure of body tissue and fluids, property, forced vaccination, testing, isolation, quarantine and arrest without due process. While not all of these draconian regulations have yet been implemented en masse, they exist in the letter of the law and therefore could be enforced, especially given that bills such as H.R.6666 use broad discretionary language leaving it to the government to intepret its meaning and apply force as it sees fit. If H.R. 6666 passes, real ""teeth"" would be put to many of the laws, acts, orders, and regulations that have been passed as executive orders over the past two months, potentially locking the entire country into an irreversible control grid the likes of which we have not seen outside of countries like China.

In light of this, H.R. 6666 may be setting the stage for the implementation of what WHO director Dr. Mike Ryan of the WHO and Ventura County California officials, say will include forcibly removing family members found positive or suspected of being infected. The only way to prevent this is to make sure the bill is opposed and dies.

Eligible recipients of funds include “faith-based” and “school-based” institutions, implying that these organizations might also become, in part, testing or treatment centers.

What is Contract Tracing?

Take a few minutes to watch the important reports by independent journalists Spyro Skouras and James Corbett on the contact tracing agenda in the rapidly unfolding story of coronavirus.

Contract tracing, which on the surface appears to mitigate the risk of disease spread by identifying carriers and interfering their further contact with the healthy, is based on a series of flawed assumptions:

The disease known as COVID-19 and believed to be caused by a singular infectious disease entity, i.e. the viral particle known as SARS-CoV-2, has never been validated through Koch postulates to be inducible and solely caused by SARS-CoV-2 within a controlled clinical or experimental setting. Over 100 different types of coronavirus have already been identified in circulation naturally around the world, and there is serious doubt that we can adequately distinguish between natural extracellular vesicles such as human exosomes and novel or endogenous forms of coronovirus already present in the human virome with the tests being used today, namely, RT-PCR. Learn more about this at www.questioningcovid.com That so-called “positive cases” identified through any number of over 100 different PCR-based and antibody-testing methods are accurate indicators of the presence of COVID-19, or do not generate false positives. If false positives are not accounted for, contract tracing can cause or contribute to a falsely expanding epidemic and those who are unnecessarily quarantined and treated will succumb to greatly elevated iatrogenically induced morbidity and mortality risks, which will never be discovered because the so-called “confirmed case fatality rates for COVID-19” require no viral testing, and only “suspicion of infection.” This is because the WHO and US Vital Statistics agencies explicitly advise against confirming these suspicion-based deaths through viral testing and other clinical means, in an egregious departure from both science and evidence-based medicine.

If contact tracing is fraught with technical inadequacies, why would it be so aggressively implemented nationwide? One reason is that it provides a justification for total spectrum dominance via real-time surveillance and control of the entire population under the auspices of “public health safety,” into perpetuity. In essence, it is like a new “war on terror,” but with the enemy being defined as our own bodies, or contact between bodies, and the solution the complete removal of any privacy, nor right to exempt oneself or children from medical mandates. The system would likely include tracking GPS data of mobile device users and then following back their contacts to identify, test, isolate, quarantine, medicate, or otherwise vaccinate them when one becomes available most likely in the fall of 2020. The media has already fomented profound fear through misreporting, misrepresenting, and catastrophizing case fatality projections, over the past few months. Their egregious disregard for the truth has lead to socioenomic and psychobiological impacts that are arguably orders of magnitude more harmful and deadly than this, or any other virus believed to contribute to flu-like illness. Clearly, the media and power that be could re-manufacture another crisis, or “second” or “third” wave simply be repeating what they have already one (learn more on the topic via the Corbett Report). At which point, with an army of contact tracers, testers, quarantine enforcers, and medicators and vaccinators, the systems being funded by H.R. 6666 would be ready to further this agenda.

So, why does H.R. 6666 refrain from providing even the most rudimentary details to how one of the largest and most widespread in impact bills ever introduced will impact those affected? The more vague and broad the language, the less oversight. The truth is that the detailed plans for how H.R.666 will be implemented were already written and revealed to the public a month ago by the Rockefeller Foundation in a 30-page plan titled, “NATIONAL COVID-19 TESTING ACTION PLAN:Pragmatic steps to reopen our workplaces and our communities.” Not coincidentally, the plan proposed the exact same dollar figure was required - 100 billion dollars -- and suggested that between 100-300,000 contract tracers would be needed.

At times, it seems that he is the last subscriber to the “Great Man” theory of history.

Well, none of us have control over our own obituaries

The problem is that history tends to be written by the survivors — a heel turn late in life, for instance, will obliterate any contemporary admiration. In Los Angeles, this is most clearly borne out by William Mullholland. Mulholland — an obsessed engineer whose dream was to supply Los Angeles with enough water for generations of growth — performed an examination on the St. Francis Dam hours before it collapsed, killing hundreds in one of the worst disasters in California’s history. Brilliant and witty as Mullholland was, he is now known primarily for that disaster and his abysmal behavior in the Owens Valley water conflict, which inspired the movie Chinatown.

Well, none of us have control over our own obituaries, assuming we are lucky enough to get an obituary at all. But it is certainly curious to see a man with such an obvious interest in his legacy make moves that may destroy it. This brings us to the reopening of the Tesla Fremont plant in apparent violation of an Alameda County health order prohibiting the factory from operating.

Last week, California Governor Gavin Newsom announced that some manufacturing in the state would be allowed to resume on May 8; but if the state and the county disagree, the more restrictive order is the one that matters. And although some counties may go slower than the state in reopening business, no one may go faster, according to Sonia Angell, the head of the state’s department of public health.

The immediate action began with tweets: Musk railed against the Alameda County order to continue sheltering in place and threatened to leave California. He also filed suit against Alameda County. Tesla began making cars again at its Fremont, California factory last weekend, The Verge’s Sean O’Kane reported. Workers who had been placed on furlough were called back. On Monday, Musk tweeted confirmation of that reporting and said, “If anyone is arrested, I ask that it only be me.” Shortly after that, Nevada Gigafactory workers received an email calling them back to work as well, O’Kane reported.

California should let Tesla & @elonmusk open the plant, NOW. It can be done Fast & Safely! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 12, 2020

On Tuesday, US President Donald Trump tweeted his support for Musk: “California should let Tesla & @elonmusk open the plant, NOW. It can be done Fast & Safely!” Later that evening, Alameda County announced it had received Tesla’s safety plan for Fremont and that “Tesla can begin to augment their minimum business operations this week in preparation for possible reopening as soon as next week.” On Wednesday, an internal email sent from Tesla said that the company is ramping up its production this week to get to full capacity, Bloomberg News reported.

Fremont is located in one of the six counties that make up the San Francisco Bay Area, which was the first in the country to issue shelter-in-place orders and close non-essential businesses — a move that Musk resisted at the time, causing a county health official to remark Musk had created a public health risk. But the Bay Area’s quick action — along with a little bit of luck — ensured that the cities in it were spared the full horror of the outbreak, at least so far. Though the first community-transmission cases were detected here, only about 350 deaths from COVID-19 had been confirmed as of the beginning of May; University of California San Francisco epidemiologist George Rutherford estimated that the Bay Area’s action had saved more than 1,000 lives.

“California has been progressive and forward-thinking in how they’ve handled COVID-19, and that shows in their numbers,” John Brownstein, who leads the Computational Epidemiology Lab at Boston Children’s Hospital, tells The Verge.

Meanwhile, elsewhere in the country, major outbreaks have occurred at meat packing plants. One report from a Chinese restaurant showed that a single person’s breathing infected 10 people from three families, two of which were sitting at separate tables, over the course of an hour and a half. Another report, of an outbreak in a South Korean call center, showed that one infected employee in the call center resulted in 94 cases — though how much of that is attributable to touching shared objects and how much was airflow remains unknown. A choir rehearsal with a single sick person resulted in 45 cases. At one Staten Island Amazon warehouse, there have been at least 35 cases; across 125 Amazon warehouse facilities, workers have recorded at least 606 cases. At least one Amazon warehouse worker has died of COVID-19.

“It’s outrageous.”

There are still things we don’t know about how the virus spreads, but we do have some clues from these reports: closed environments where people spend a lot of time in proximity seem to be risks, says Brownstein, who is also a professor at Harvard Medical School. Brownstein thinks there are ways to mitigate risk from these environments, but those decisions will vary by location and should be made by local and state governments.

“The biggest thing that offended me about what’s being proposed here is the civil disobedience aspect,” says Mark Cullen, director of the Center for Population Health Sciences at Stanford, in an interview. “Any time you take what turns out to be brilliant planning on the part of our six counties — and to snub the value of that very publicly, make this ‘fuck you’ libertarian statement, and say ‘if you don’t do what I want, I’ll move to another state’ — highlights what’s wrong with public health thinking and policy. It’s outrageous.”

There’s another unknown: what happens if businesses that are reopening must shut down again, says Liliana Tenney, a senior instructor at the Colorado School of Public Health. Until there’s legislation to protect these workers, we should respect local, state, and federal restrictions — and err on the side of caution, Tenney says. That protects all citizens, but particularly workers who face the choice of either working at places like Tesla or unemployment.

“Most employers are very nervous about this return to work.”

“What we’ve seen through our experience is that most employers are very nervous about this return to work and the return to operations,” Tenney tells The Verge. “And they are doing everything in their power to enact safety measures but also to pause and take it slowly.”

All of the experts I spoke to agreed there are ways to make workplaces like Tesla safer. One is to group workers into cohorts, so if one person in the group gets sick, the number of people who are exposed is smaller. Screening people for coronavirus on a daily or weekly basis will also make it less likely a disastrous outbreak will occur, particularly if it’s paired with contact tracing. Personal protective equipment, such as masks and gloves, may make workers safer, too. Managing the facility — spacing people out, increasing ventilation, and disinfecting surfaces more frequently — will also lower risks to the workforce.

A “return to work” playbook from Tesla incorporates these ideas, which the company says were inspired by measures implemented at the Chinese Gigafactory. Measures include increased cleaning, providing hand sanitizer, enforcing social distancing, temperature checks at the entry of the factory, adjusting work shifts, reducing the number of people allowed on company shuttles, and providing personal protective equipment. One of the assembly lines is, famously, a tent in a parking lot, which may also provide better ventilation than indoor lines.

“It’s hard to stay six feet from people.”

Production lines are moving more slowly than usual, according to internal Tesla correspondence seen by CNBC. Three Fremont employees told the outlet that their temperatures were taken at the factory entrance, dispensers for hand sanitizer had been placed, and they’d been given surgical masks. Scheduled break times were meant to reduce contact in bathrooms and dining areas.

Still, several employees feel they are being pressured to return to work, NBC News reported. One worker said that her supervisor told her that if she didn’t return to work as directed, she was in danger of being fired. Internal Tesla emails viewed by NBC said that employees who didn’t return to work would no longer receive unemployment insurance, and would have to take unpaid leave. A worker told NBC that staying away from people in the plant was difficult. “It’s hard to stay six feet from people,” the anonymous employee told the outlet. “It’s a production line. There’s a lot of people.” Another worker told The New York Times that the production line hadn’t changed much, making it difficult to avoid other workers.

That was echoed in comments to Joseph Geha, a reporter for the Bay Area News Group: “The work that we do requires us to constantly be in close proximity to people,” the worker said. (The negative views are not uniformly held: a worker told Geha that they were fine with the factory reopening.) Another worker told The San Jose Mercury News that tools used on the production line are shared and aren’t being cleaned or sanitized between uses.

“I think Tesla did a pretty good job, and that’s why I had it to the point where on May 18, Tesla would have opened.”

On one level, the kerfuffle is bewildering. Musk has spent years presenting himself as an enthusiastic acolyte of science. What’s more, in an interview with The New York Times on May 9th, an Alameda county official said that the county and Tesla had been close to an agreement to reopen the plant on May 18.

“We were working on a lot of policies and procedures to help operate that plant and quite frankly, I think Tesla did a pretty good job, and that’s why I had it to the point where on May 18, Tesla would have opened,” said Scott Haggerty, the county supervisor for the district where the Fremont plant operates, according to The New York Times. “I know Elon knew that. But he wanted it this week.”

The May 18 restart would have put Tesla squarely in line with other automakers’ efforts to reopen their plants. Mercedes-Benz fired up its Alabama facility on April 27. BMW’s South Carolina plant started up on May 4; GM began production on May 11, as did Honda, Subaru, and Volvo. Toyota planned to restart its US production this week. Fiat Chrysler will resume on May 18, as will Ford. Volkswagen has postponed starting up its plants indefinitely.

What’s more, car sales cratered in March. In April, though, they seemed to slightly recover, though sales were still down 50 percent compared with April 2019. So why start the fight with Alameda at all?

“As the world comes back online, Tesla will be competing against other automakers who are literally throwing out all the stops.”

Just before the coronavirus-related health orders closed plants, Tesla was launching its Model Y SUV. SUVs, along with pickup trucks, were among the few bright spots in the market these last few months, says Jessica Caldwell, an analyst for Edmunds. Dealers have also been offering remarkable incentives, such as zero percent interest loans for as long as seven years. Different areas in the world are recovering at different speeds, Caldwell points out. So Musk might want his factories up and running for when markets — in the US or elsewhere — recover. And Tesla makes cars at just two places: Shanghai and Fremont.

“If they’re not producing at either factory they have no global production,” Caldwell says. “And as the world comes back online, Tesla will be competing against other automakers who are literally throwing out all the stops.”

The Model Y is particularly important, says Karl Brauer, the executive publisher at Autotrader and Kelly Blue Book. “He’s got enough demand in the US and globally that he can probably sell most — if not every — Model Y about as fast as he can build them.”

“Elon rightfully feels that taking a non-conventional approach has served him relatively well.”

There’s another factor, and it’s political. Before starting his standoff with Alameda County, Musk was already agitating to open Fremont on a private call with President Donald Trump and some other CEOs. Musk told Trump that he did not view returning to work as a significant risk, and the president agreed, The Washington Post reported. SpaceX, Musk’s commercial space company, is heavily reliant on government contracts; if Musk were trying to curry favor with Trump, it wouldn’t be the first time.

There’s also Musk’s image to consider, says Brauer. “Elon rightfully feels that taking a non-conventional approach has served him relatively well for the last 15 years that he’s been at Tesla,” Brauer says. “So if it’s unconventional to break a government mandate if he doesn’t think it’s a necessary level of caution, it plays into his image and his customer base, which likes his unconventional approach.”

But the question may be if Musk loses more than he gains by aligning himself with Trump and others who have persistently tried to convince Americans that stay-home orders aren’t necessary, Brauer says. He might gain new customers — people who ordinarily might not care about electric vehicles but want to support Musk for pushing back against government overreach. Longtime Tesla customers, though, might feel alienated, particularly those who are more collectively-minded.

“I drive a fucking Tesla.”

Cullen, the epidemiologist, is among that group. “I drive a fucking Tesla,” Cullen tells The Verge. “When the cheap ones came out, I bought one. I love the car. I don’t love Musk.”

If Musk reopens Tesla successfully, and without sickening his workers, we should all expect an “I told you so!” tweetstorm. But if Fremont workers get sick and bring COVID-19 with them into the places where they live, seeding outbreaks like we’ve seen with meatpacking plants and other close-quarters facilities, Musk stands to lose a tremendous amount of confidence the public has placed in him. Historically, Musk has been a connoisseur of risk — but now he’s gambling with his legacy.

If Alameda County’s COVID-19 case counts spike two or three weeks from now, Musk’s role in seeding an epidemic will likely be the first line in his obituary. Under the Great Man theory of history, the man in question takes all the blame.",real
639,https://chicago.suntimes.com/2020/5/6/21249524/justices-wary-obamacare-birth-control-coverage-changes-donald-trump-contraceptive-coronavirus,2020-05-06,Justices wary of ‘Obamacare’ birth control coverage changes,"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court seemed concerned Wednesday about the sweep of Trump administration rules that would allow more employers who cite a religious or moral objection to opt out of providing no-cost birth control to women as required by the Affordable Care Act.

The justices were hearing their third day of arguments conducted by telephone because of the coronavirus pandemic. The first of two cases before them Wednesday stemmed from the Obama-era health law, under which most employers must cover birth control as a preventive service, at no charge to women, in their insurance plans.

In 2017, the Trump administration announced it would broaden an exemption to the contraceptive coverage requirement that previously applied to houses of worship, such as churches, synagogues and mosques. But the change was blocked by courts.

The Supreme Court’s four liberal justices suggested they were troubled by the changes, which the government has estimated would cause about 70,000 women, and at most 126,000 women, to lose contraception coverage in one year.

Chief Justice John Roberts, a key vote on a court split between conservatives and liberals, suggested that the Trump administration’s reliance on a federal religious freedom law to expand the exemption was “too broad.”

And Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who joined the conversation from a Maryland hospital where she was being treated for an infection caused by a gallstone, gave the government’s top Supreme Court lawyer, Solicitor General Noel Franciso, what sounded like a lecture.

“You have just tossed entirely to the wind what Congress thought was essential, that is that women be provided these .... services with no hassle, no cost to them,” said Ginsburg, who is expected to be in the hospital for a day or two.

The court’s conservative justices seemed more willing to side with the administration, with Trump appointee Justice Brett Kavanaugh suggesting the administration’s changes might be considered “within the bounds of reasonable.”

Beyond exempting churches, synagogues and mosques from the contraceptive coverage requirement, the Obama administration also created a way by which religiously affiliated organizations including hospitals, universities and charities could opt out of paying for contraception, but women on their health plans would still get no-cost birth control. Some groups complained the opt-out process itself violated their religious beliefs.

That opt-out process was the subject of a previous Supreme Court case, but the court, with only eight justices at the time because of the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, didn’t decide the issue. It instead sent both sides back to see if they could work out a compromise.

That didn’t happen. “Is it really the case that there is no way to resolve those differences?” Roberts asked at one point.

After the Trump administration took over, officials announced a rule change that allows many companies and organization with religious or moral objections to opt out of covering birth control without providing an alternate avenue for coverage.

New Jersey and Pennsylvania challenged the rules in court, and a judge blocked them from going into effect. The judge found the Trump administration did not follow proper procedures for issuing the rules. An appeals court agreed, and the administration appealed to the Supreme Court to step in, as did the Little Sisters of the Poor. The order of Roman Catholic nuns had been instrumental in challenging the Obama administration rules.

But on Wednesday, Justice Sonia Sotomayor questioned why the Little Sisters of the Poor were even at the court because for a number of reasons they don’t have to provide contraceptive coverage. Sotomayor also referenced the coronavirus pandemic during her questioning, asking attorney Paul Clement, who was representing the nuns, whether an employer might be able to object to paying for a coronavirus vaccine. He said “no.”

Even though the Trump rules remain blocked, a ruling by a federal judge in Texas in June already allows most people who object to covering contraception to avoid doing so.

In the second case the justices heard Wednesday, political consultants and pollsters were among those asking the Supreme Court to strike down a federal law from 1991 that bars them from making robocalls to cellphones. The case only arose after Congress in 2015 created an exception in the law that allows the automated calls for collection of government debt.

The court wrestled with whether it could get rid of just the government-debt restriction or would have to invalidate the entire ban on cellphone robocalls. “No one wants robocalls on their cellphone,” Roberts said, though he typically votes for the challengers in free-speech cases.

The argument provided a light moment of the day when Justice Stephen Breyer got cut off when someone tried calling him. Breyer said after he rejoined the court’s arguments: “The telephone started to ring, and it cut me off the call and I don’t think it was a robocall.”",real

Fake ID papers used by Nazi SS leader Heinrich Himmler in an attempt to flee Germany in May 1945 have been donated to the Military Intelligence Museum in the UK town of Shefford, the BBC reports.

The documents, which were unearthed 75 years after Himmler’s death, have recently been handed over to the museum by the great niece of Lieutenant-Colonel Sidney Noakes, a lawyer who joined the UK Intelligence Corps in 1943.

The papers are expected to be put on display after the planned reopening of the museum, which was closed due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

Himmler used the fake documents, which identified him as Sergeant Heinrich Hizinger, as he planned to hide out in northern Germany’s Harz Mountains following Adolf Hitler’s suicide and the subsequent unconditional surrender of the country in World War Two.

On 22 May 1945, Himmler and his two companions were arrested after an Allied patrol asked for their identity papers, which carried an official stamp used by SS members in a bid to flee Germany.

The three men were then sent to a detention camp, where Himmler revealed his real identity and was then reportedly given a “gentle interrogation” by the British security service MI5; shortly after, the SS head committed suicide by swallowing a cyanide capsule.

Bill Steadman, curator of the Military Intelligence Museum, has meanwhile been cited by the Daily Mail as saying that “without this damning stamp on the document it is possible that Himmler may have been able to pass through the system unnoticed, and escape as did many other wanted Nazis”.

As one of the masterminds of the Holocaust, Himmler oversaw the implementation of the so-called “Final Solution”, a plan for the genocide of all European Jews.",fake

The U.S. is fast approaching a full 100,000 Coronavirus deaths, but this weekend, Trump went golfing at a course in northern Virginia that’s a part of his own company. During a recent appearance on MSNBC, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) delivered a memorable takedown of the efforts from the president and his allies to distract Americans from the actual devastation at hand. Ahead of the November election, Trump seems desperate to rush into any kind of rhetoric except the reality of the situation.

As Schiff summarized on Twitter:

‘Over 90,000 Americans have died from COVID-19. Our economy is in a downward spiral to Great Depression-levels. Trump doesn’t want the public to focus on his tragic failures. So, to paraphrase Steve Bannon, in order to distract: His people are flooding the zone with excrement.’

The conspiracy theories from the president and his allies have been numerous at this point. Towards the beginning of the crisis, the president even claimed that concern about the virus was a “hoax” and suggested that coverage of the then-growing crisis was some kind of plot to make him look bad. That obviously was not true. More recently, the president’s team’s conspiracy theories have included the idea that the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine is some kind of untapped goldmine for Coronavirus treatment, but a new study reveals that among tens of thousands of Coronavirus cases, usage of the drug was linked with a higher death rate across the board.

Hydroxychloroquine, the antimalarial drug touted by President Trump, is linked to increased risk of death in coronavirus patients, according to analysis of 96,000 patients published in the Lancet. Hydroxychloroquine is unproven for fighting coronavirus. https://t.co/LpHS9CuEmL — MSNBC (@MSNBC) May 23, 2020

Most recently, Trump staged a spectacle at a White House press conference on Friday when he claimed that governors must allow churches and other houses of worship to reopen this weekend or else he would “override” them and reopen the churches himself. Trump has no authority to “override” governors, and besides, religious and political authorities around the country have already been collaborating on the development of safe reopening plans for houses of worship. Trump’s spectacle was for show.

1937,https://www.naturalnews.com/2020-05-23-trump-orders-churches-worship-to-reopen.html,2020-05-23,President Trump orders houses of worship to reopen … threatens to override states that refuse,"(Natural News) President Donald Trump has declared places of worship, such as churches, synagogues and mosques, as essential services and has called on governors to allow these religious institutions to reopen. The president has also said he will âoverrideâ the decisions of any state leaders who don’t agree to reopen churches.

âThe ministers, pastors, rabbis, imams and other faith leaders will make sure their congregations are safe as they gather and pray,â said Trump at a hastily scheduled appearance Friday in the briefing room of the White House.

The president’s order comes as he criticizes the “hypocrisy” of some governors who have allowed liquor stores and abortion clinics to remain open while keeping houses of worship under lockdown.

âItâs not right, so Iâm correcting this injustice and calling houses of worship essential,â Trump told reporters.

In response to the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, most houses of worship in the U.S. have closed their doors for the time being, with some providing virtual services. However, others have tried to continue with normal services and bringing their congregations together, which has prompted some pushback from local authorities. (Related: Churchgoers vow they would rather DIE than skip services during coronavirus lockdown.)

State and local officials critical of order

Trump made no mention of how exactly he would compel governors and state authorities to reopen religious institutions. Currently, legal experts are saying that the president has no power to compel state governments, especially if the order to shut down places of worship was done lawfully.

State and local politicians have similarly expressed resistance to this order.

Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo said she will not alter her state’s lockdown protocols to reopen churches. Similarly, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot announced that her city will be ignoring Trump’s demand.

âBy no means can the president order any locality, any state to do something that he doesn’t have the power to do,â said Lightfoot. âAnd he can’t do that here.â

Public health experts have raised concerns about the risks entailed with reopening religious institutions, especially when there have already been several cases of outbreaks spreading from church congregations. A small outbreak of COVID-19 broke out in rural Arkansas which spread from a pastor and his wife to around three dozen of their parishioners. At least two churches in Texas and Georgia have already shut down after reopening when several of their members tested positive for the coronavirus.

Listen to theÂ Health Ranger ReportÂ with Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, as he talks about how the lockdowns have been weaponized to the detriment of humanity.

CDC issues guidelines for reopening of places of worship

TheÂ Centers for Disease Control and PreventionÂ (CDC) released guidelines Friday afternoon about what communities of faith should follow if they want to maintain good health when they reopen.

Religious institutions should, above all, establish and maintain lines of communication with local and state authorities, provide proper protective equipment for staff and congregants and abide by local, state and federal laws and regulations put in place to protect everyone.

Once churches reopen, the CDC laid out seven key guidelines they need to follow:

Follow social distancing regulationsÂ — Limit the size of gatherings and consider holding services in large or outdoor areas.

— Limit the size of gatherings and consider holding services in large or outdoor areas. Encourage the use of face masksÂ — Both staff and congregants should wear face coverings, especially when social distancing is difficult to follow.

— Both staff and congregants should wear face coverings, especially when social distancing is difficult to follow. Intensify cleaning, disinfection and ventilation effortsÂ — Develop a proper schedule when employees will clean and disinfect all frequently touched surfaces in the building. Increase ventilation in the building and ensure that the church’s current ventilation systems are working properly.

— Develop a proper schedule when employees will clean and disinfect all frequently touched surfaces in the building. Increase ventilation in the building and ensure that the church’s current ventilation systems are working properly. Promote healthy hygiene practicesÂ — Encourage both staff and attendees to practice proper hygiene, such as the washing of hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.

— Encourage both staff and attendees to practice proper hygiene, such as the washing of hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Provide childcare services for congregantsÂ — Consider opening proper childcare services, or partnering with nurseries in the area.

— Consider opening proper childcare services, or partnering with nurseries in the area. Minimize the sharing of worship materials and other itemsÂ — Consider temporarily limiting the sharing of materials, such as worship aids, prayer books and other items.

— Consider temporarily limiting the sharing of materials, such as worship aids, prayer books and other items. Train staffÂ — Train both clergy and staff in the above-mentioned guidelines.

The CDC further stated that, during these troubling times, faith leaders should continue providing congregants with spiritual and emotional care and counseling services.

DespiteÂ these guidelines, it remains unclear if Trump can force state and local authorities to reopen houses of worship. The U.S. Constitution reserves considerable powers to states and several courts have already set restrictions on in-person worship services during the pandemic for the promotion of public health.

1068,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/operation-warp-speed-coronavirus-vaccine-development-trump-top-officials/,2020-05-15,"Trump announces top officials for ""Operation Warp Speed"" for coronavirus vaccine development","President Trump expressed optimism on Friday about the timeline and success of a coronavirus vaccine on Friday, as he announced new top officials to lead ""Operation Warp Speed"" intended to develop and identify an effective vaccine. Moncef Slaoui and General Gustave Perna will lead the federal government's effort to develop and distribute a vaccine as quickly as possible.

Sloui is a former pharma executive, and Perna is the commander of the United States Army Material Command.

The president told reporters in the White House Rose Garden he thinks they're going to have a vaccine in the ""pretty near future,"" by the end of the year. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar also said a vaccine should be available to the public by January.

However, experts like Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading infectious diseases expert, say a vaccine will take 12-18 months to develop.

J.B. Pritzker was urged Thursday to relax his five-step plan to re-open Illinois — by allowing restaurants to open at 25% capacity on June 1 with strict safeguards for their employees.

Illinois Restaurant Association President Sam Toia said without changes, Pritzker’s plan would have a devastating impact on restaurants and bars because it would force them to wait until June 28 at the earliest to re-open to dine-in customers.

Instead, Toia proposed restaurants be allowed to move to Phase 3 on June 1 and relax restrictions every 14 days, instead of waiting 28 days between phases.

“We would have a lot of restrictions. Personal protective equipment. Face coverings. Social distancing. Taking the temperature of employees when they come in to work,” Toia said.

“June 1 is still three weeks away. ... Indiana, Texas, Arizona, Georgia and Tennessee are open. Let’s see if they have a spike. If they do, OK. If they don’t, I would really urge the governor to look at letting us re-open with 25% or less capacity, then use the 14-day model and, hopefully, by mid-June be at 50% capacity.”

Toia acknowledged restaurants operate on razor-thin margins and “economic models don’t work on 25% capacity.”

But, with restaurants literally fighting for survival, he’s willing to take what he can get.

“If we wait until the end of June, it will be 16 weeks that 50% or more of the restaurants in the city of Chicago have been closed and [the other] 50% are 80% down in sales. I don’t think there is any economic model out there that says you can stay in business” in that situation, Toia said.

“The further we go, the harder it is gonna be for restaurants to re-open. The National Restaurant Association is predicting that 20% of the restaurants won’t re-open. That’s basically looking at the end of May. If we go `til the end of June, it could be 45% or more of restaurants that never re-open. And restaurants are the soul of every neighborhood in Chicago,” Toia said.

“The governor understands the desire to open up sectors of our economy as quickly as possible because he shares that same sense of urgency,” said Jordan Abudayyeh, Pritzker’s press secretary. But, she added, “the state’s five-phase plan was put together by health experts and lays groundwork for how we move forward with a new normal. From day one, the governor has relied on science and data to drive the response to this deadly virus and staying on this course will continue to save lives.”

The governor’s plan has been criticized for being too conservative, moving too slowly between phases and setting too many hurdles to get there.

Although he divided the state into four regions, each authorized to re-open on its own timeline — based on positive test results, hospital admissions for COVID-19 symptoms and ICU beds and ventilators — no region could move to the next phase without waiting 28 days.

And none could return to normal until there is either a vaccine for the coronavirus or widely available treatment. That means no gatherings larger than 50. No conventions at McCormick Place. No major festivals like Lollapalooza and Taste of Chicago. And no major sporting events with fans in attendance.

Schools, restaurants, bars, movie theaters and gyms would have to wait until Phase 4 — June 28 at the earliest — to open, and even then would have strict limits on capacity.

Business groups and their allies in the Illinois General Assembly are concerned that, by the time various regions meet those hurdles, scores of businesses already will close for good, taking thousands of jobs with them.

That’s Toia’s argument in a nutshell.

“Governor Cuomo has been at the forefront just as much as Governor Pritzker has. But why is New York using a 14-day period to move between phases and we’re using a 28-day period?” he said.

But how willing will customers be to return to restaurant dining?

“If we’re only opening with 25% or less capacity, I think people will come. I don’t think everybody will run out. But enough people will. … It’s all about cash-flow,” Toia said.

A mayoral appointee to the Zoning Board of Appeals, Toia said he has talked to Mayor Lori Lightfoot “and her team” about his plan.

“The mayor wants to see what the governor is gonna do. But the mayor is trying to be very progressive with us. There’s communication going on about maybe closing some streets for outside dining with the tables on the street. That way, we could have social distancing,” Toia said.

“There’s no question that she wants to think outside the box about how we help these restaurants throughout our 77 communities stay viable as we move ahead.”",real

Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Thursday banned gatherings of 500 or more in the city, effectively forcing the hand of Broadway producers who had previously said that Broadway would be “open for business” unless advised not to by the government.

Shows will resume the week of April 13, only 10 days before the official cut-off for eligibility for the Tony Awards. Cuomo said venues of under 500 can only be filled to half their capacity.

On Broadway, would-be theater attendees were turned away, some shaking their heads in disbelief. “I had been hoping to catch one but it’s all canceled,” said Quinn Heath, 24, who was visiting from Boston.

Closing all Broadway theaters for a month is unprecedented, said Laurence Maslon, an arts professor at New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts. “Nothing comes close to this amount of time ever.”

The move comes a day after Broadway’s two largest theater chains revealed that a part-time usher and security guard who worked at two theaters in recent days tested positive for COVID-19 and was under quarantine.

The pressure on Broadway to go dark steadily increased as other entertainment hubs shuttered, including Carnegie Hall, the Metropolitan Opera, the NBA, NHL, CinemaCon, Coachella and Major League Soccer.

Actors took to Twitter to share their sadness. “My heart is with all my friends and colleagues,” wrote Tony Award-nominee Judy Kuhn. “This is really bad for everyone who depends on the theater for their livelihoods.” Kerry Butler, a Tony-nominated star of “Beetlejuice,” said the shuttering ”is the right move to keep everyone safe.”

For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.

The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover.

Other theaters far from Broadway have closed their doors, including the Wallis Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts in California, which canceled or postponed all productions and programs through March 31. The 5th Avenue Theatre in Seattle closed its doors, citing the state’s mandated cancellation of public gatherings. The 1,600-seat Curran Theater in San Francisco decided to scrap performances of “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.”

Broadway producers were cautious until now, with a wait-and-see approach for an industry that grossed $1.8 billion last season. The Broadway League, a trade organization representing producers and theater owners, recommended that actors refrain from greeting fans at the stage door.

The league said it had increased the frequency of cleaning and disinfecting all public and backstage areas. It also added alcohol-based sanitizer dispensers for public use in the lobby of every theater.

Producers have been historically unwilling to cancel shows, which had an average paid admission last week of over $100. The last time they did so was in 2016, when a ban on travel in New York and the suspension of public transportation due to snow forced theater owners to cancel one day’s shows. Superstorm Sandy in 2012 darkened Broadway for four days and cost more than $8.5 million in lost revenue. Broadway theaters stayed open during the 1918 influenza epidemic.

Broadway is particularly vulnerable to the new coronavirus because its audience skews older, thousands of people are packed into small seats for every show and the industry is dependent on tourism. Of the 14.8 million admissions in the 2018-2019 season, 65% were made by tourists — 46% from Americans outside New York and 19% from other countries.

Actors’ Equity Association, which represents more than 51,000 actors and stage managers nationwide, had urged officials and producers to consider the health and economic welfare of theater workers in their decision.

The shuttering of all 41 Broadway theaters will cause chaos to the spring theatrical calendar, which culminates in the Tony Awards on May 19. Several shows — including “Company,” “Caroline, Or Change,” “Diana” and “Mrs. Doubtfire” — had scheduled to open during the time when theaters are closed.

Maslon noted that many of the spring’s biggest shows were waiting to open and he saw no reason why the Broadway League wouldn’t adjust its eligibility date. “I think they have to extend the season,” he said.

Established shows will likely weather the storm better than one’s waiting to open. “If it’s ‘Lion King,’ they’ll just pick up where they left off. But for shows like ‘Diana’ or ‘Hangman’ or ‘Company,’ which are still in previews and still trying to figure it out, it’s going to be very complicated.”

Last week, attendance was actually higher than the previous week, but many believed that Broadway would not be able to avoid the effects of the outbreak forever, especially if school groups and tourists decided to skip New York in big numbers.",real

The counter-demonstrators, who showed up unannounced, lacking any permission from the authorities, argued that the anti-lockdown rally attracted many right-wing extremists. “Against conspiracy fantasies, anti-semites and the right-wing agenda,” one of the posters read.

Although both rallies ended without a major incident, scuffles broke out between police and counter-protesters. A bottle was hurled at the officers from the crowd, police said. One person was arrested but was released later.

The anti-lockdown gathering was greenlit to go ahead after organizers agreed to cap the number of its participants at 750 instead of some 3,500-4,000, as originally requested. The Hamburg Administrative Court ruled to limit the number of those who could join the rally so police would be able to enforce the social distancing guidelines, imposed to stem the coronavirus pandemic.

Less than 20 minutes after the meeting officially kicked off, at about 3:17 p.m. local time, the maximum allowed number of participants had already arrived, police said, noting that it had to block more people from coming.

The demonstrators stood several feet apart from each other, chanting slogans and holding anti-lockdown banners, some of which read: “The right to distance instead of a ban on contacts,” “Free accessible tests for everybody instead of the quarantine for everybody” as well as “Stop the corona madness! Basic law now!”

The participants of the rally denounced the government’s response to the outbreak, which has seen some 177,850 testing positive for Covid-19, including 8,216 who have died as a result of the disease.

One of the speakers at the rally argued that more people have died due to planned surgeries being postponed than from the virus itself. There have also been calls to make future vaccinations voluntary, although the authorities have never said that the coronavirus shot would be mandatory.

Several dozen rallies for and against the lockdown measures were also held in Berlin, including outside the Reichstag building, home to the German parliament.

That gathering also prompted a counter-action, with demonstrators branding those opposing the coronavirus restrictions “tin foil hats” and “Nazis.” Some 1000 police were deployed to ensure social distancing. In the wake of the protests, some 180 people faced administrative and criminal charges for violating the restrictions, including The Infectious Diseases Protection Act, police said.

According to the most recently published article by JAMA (An International peer-reviewed medical journal association), the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory illness that results from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Furthermore, the article shares that following initial reports of disease outbreak in China, COVID-19 has spread worldwide with cases identified in at least 67 countries across 6 continents. So if this is an acute respiratory illness why is the world-wide population running out of toilet paper? Ok, I must admit this is funny but not really!

What is coronavirus disease 2019?

According to the CDC, the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory illness that can spread from person to person. The virus that causes COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus that was first identified during an investigation into an outbreak in Wuhan, China. It spreads from person to person and the risk of infection lies if you are in close contact with someone that has it. As of March 27th, 2020, the CDC has reported 68,440 total cases nationwide. Travel-related cases 636, close contact related 1,074, and under investigation 66,730 cases.

What are the Symptoms?

It looks like the symptoms are similar to a cold or the flu, with fever, cough, and shortness of breath.

Can a Virus be killed?

This is could totally fall under a trick question category. I’ve gotten different feedback from my circle of doctors and honestly after many physician surveys and personal research, it is my opinion that the answer to this tricky question is NO. Viruses can’t function without interacting with a living cell. On their own, they’re also essentially inert — unable to move. According to The National Human Genome Research Institute, “A virus is an infectious agent that occupies a place near the boundary between the living and the nonliving. It is a particle much smaller than a bacterial cell, consisting of a small genome of either DNA or RNA surrounded by a protein coat. Viruses enter host cells and hijack the enzymes and materials of the host cells to make more copies of themselves. Viruses cause a wide variety of diseases in plants and animals, including AIDS, measles, smallpox, and polio.” In order for viruses to thrive and live these must find a host. This article further explains a virus is a small infectious agent that can only replicate inside the cells of another organism. Viruses are found wherever there is life and have probably existed since living cells first evolved. Viruses do not have their own metabolism and require a host cell to make new products. In other words, once a virus finds a host, the host and virus go into war and let the stronger one win.

Is there a Vaccine or Treatment for the Coronavirus?

NOPE! There is no vaccine or antiviral treatment against COVID-19. The best cure is prevention! Below I share my preventive tips for you and your loved ones to follow as preventive means to this worldwide threat.

The Fear Factor

It is amazing to me to see how our human nature so easily gravitates to fear mode and we are easily triggered to respond from a place of fear versus reasoning or just common sense. Although there’s much evidence that indicates that fear suppresses our immunity somehow social panic continues to prevail in the face of this so-called worldwide threat. Keep in mind that we are modeling to our children how to react in the face of challenging circumstances. Perhaps behind the scenes of this pandemic virus hides the acts of cleverly masked and highly manipulative private organizations, selective groups and why not even governments. I guess there is no way to know for sure but what we do know for sure is that through technology and social media we can get up-to-date worldwide news and respond quickly to life-altering events such as the Coronavirus outbreak.

How can We Protect Ourselves?

As I have said there’s no magic bullet to fight off this COVID-19 virus. A study published by The Journal of Hospital Infection found that the virus can linger on surfaces like metal, glass or plastic for up to 9 days. However, it can be efficiently inactivated by surface disinfection procedures. The most important line of defense you and I have against it is to be proactive to follow some specific precautions and most definitely boost our immune system. Here are some steps to implement and follow immediately:

Avoid exposure (stay home / avoid crowded places)

Keep social distance

Wash hands often with soap for at least 20 seconds

Disinfect surfaces with household cleaning products

Use disposable utensils

Do not touch your eyes, nose, and mouth

Cover your cough and sneeze

Avoid contact with sick people

Stay home and wear a mask if you are sick

Make children feel safe and share facts with them

Empathy is key

Try to maintain a normal routine

Model the behavior you want to see

Take care of yourself by boosting your immunity

How can I Boost my Immune System?

A healthy immune system is key to protect ourselves from ALL kinds of diseases. Keeping our immunity strong is most definitely the best form of prevention and our strongest defense when facing any sort of illness that threatens our lives. Boosting our immune system is a great way to keep us healthy and ready in the face of something like the COVID-19. Here are some powerful and amazing tips to help you boost your immunity:

Take a good Probiotic

As you probably know, your immune system begins in the gut. Did you know that 80% of your immune system is in your gut? Gut health has overwhelmingly been linked to the health of your immune system. Because of the foods we eat, and the chemicals in our environment,

no matter how hard we work to create toxin-free homes, the good bacteria in the gut of the average modern person is overwhelmingly low. A good source of probiotics can cause that community of good bacteria to flourish in your gut, providing continual nourishment of the immune system.

The Power of Beta 1,3D Glucan

Beta-Glucans are one of the greatest weapons ever introduced to the immune system. Beta 1,3D Glucan helps reduce free radicals, can act as an antioxidant, and it’s effective in supporting the immune system by:

Helps naturally modulate a healthy immune system

Helps reduce free radicals and can act like an antioxidant

Effective in supporting the immune system: Increases t-cell production Enhances macrophages Enhances natural killer cell functionality



Vitamin D3 a must-have

Vitamin D supplementation has been proven to assist with immune system health. A lack of vitamin D is associated with a multitude of health problems: cancer, auto-immune disease, osteoporosis, and multiple infectious diseases, just to name a few. Researchers have found that Vitamin D:

Regulates the enzymes in your brain that help with nerve growth, neurotransmitter production, and synaptic density. These are all things that are essential for brain health.

It helps maintain intracellular calcium and phosphorus levels.

Protects your nervous tissue from oxidative stress.

It helps control your immune system response.

And more.

Camu Camu as your natural source of Vitamin C

This Peruvian berry is found in the wilderness of the Amazon rainforest. Camu Camu contains more immune-boosting and inflammation-fighting Vitamin C than any other food. In powdered form, just one single teaspoonful of the powerful berry contains 1200% of your daily recommended minimum Vitamin C!

The Immune Benefits of MACA

Also, known as a powerful adaptogen, this Peruvian superfood is a well-known immune booster for its ability to increase glutathione production known to improve immune function and cause disease resistance. Maca is a cruciferous vegetable and therefore related to broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, and kale. It has a long history of medicinal use in Peru.

Exercise

When you exercise, the number of white blood cells can increase, which increases your disease-fighting arsenal. It has also been suggested that any exercise that increases your breathing and heart-rate can flush toxins out of your lungs, making it more difficult for cold and flu to take hold, and less likely that a secondary infection will develop from viruses.

Infrared Sauna

I am so blessed to have one at home, as this therapy can help you not only to detoxify the body and stimulate your immune system and immune response, but it is also known to get rid of bacteria and viruses.

Conclusion

I sincerely hope you have found this article helpful and as always I encourage you to send me your comments in the box below. Sending you lots of love and peace during this difficult season. Stay safe and stay healthy!

Trump suspended U.S. contributions to the WHO last month, accusing it of promoting Chinese “disinformation” about the novel coronavirus outbreak, although WHO officials denied the accusation and China said it was transparent and open.

""If the WHO does not commit to major substantive improvements within the next 30 days, I will make my temporary freeze of United States funding to the WHO permanent and reconsider our membership,"" Trump told its chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, in a letter posted bit.ly/3bNB3R7 on Twitter.

Earlier, Trump said the Geneva-based WHO had “done a very sad job” in its handling of the coronavirus, which emerged in China late last year, and he would make a decision on funding soon.

Trump said in the letter the only way forward for the WHO was for it to demonstrate independence from China, adding that his administration had started discussing reform with Tedros.

Trump also made various accusations against China in the letter including that it tried to block evidence the virus could be transmitted between people, pressed the WHO not to declare it an emergency, refused to share data and samples and denied access to its scientists and facilities.

China hit back on Tuesday with its foreign ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, saying the letter was slanderous.

“The U.S. leadership’s open letter is filled with phrases of suggestions, maybes, and potentialities, and is trying to mislead the public through this specious method, to achieve the goal of smearing and slandering China’s efforts in epidemic prevention and to shift responsibility in its own incompetence in handling the epidemic,” Zhao told a regular briefing.

Zhao said the U.S. decision to stop contributing to the WHO was a violation of its international obligations.

‘REVIEW AS SOON AS POSSIBLE’

A WHO spokeswoman in Geneva said on Tuesday the agency had no immediate comment on Trump’s letter but expected to have “more clarity” and a reaction to it later in the day.

On Monday, the WHO said an independent review of the global coronavirus response would begin as soon as possible and it had received backing and a hefty pledge of funds from China.

The WHO, a U.N. specialized agency, is leading a global initiative to develop safe and effective vaccines, tests and drugs to prevent, diagnose and treat COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus.

More than 4.75 million people have been infected globally and 314,414 have died, according to a Reuters tally.

The United States contributed more than $400 million to the WHO in 2019, or about 15% of its budget.

This year, the United States has already paid the WHO about $58 million, senior Trump administration officials said last month, half of what it is required to pay for 2020 - known as an assessed contribution.

The United States traditionally provides several hundred million dollars annually in voluntary funding tied to specific WHO programmes like polio eradication, vaccine-preventable disease, HIV and hepatitis, tuberculosis, and maternal and child and health.

“It’s a troubling time for them,” Common said, “because they are the people who usually are overlooked.”

On Wednesday, his criminal justice reform organization Imagine Justice launched a campaign with dozens of advocacy and activist groups calling attention to the threat that the coronavirus pandemic poses on millions of men, women and youths who are incarcerated in the U.S.

The campaign, dubbed #WeMatterToo, is urging authorities to immediately release people who have served the vast majority of their sentences, especially if they have existing health conditions that put them at greater risk of severe illness or death from COVID-19. Although state and local correctional institutions have already released thousands of people from confinement due to the pandemic, supporters of the campaign also want governments to pay for testing and housing for inmates after they are released.

Common said he also hopes to create greater public awareness about what happens inside the nation’s jails and prisons and the impact that has on society.

“We all have unanswered questions about the pandemic,” the Grammy and Academy Award winning rapper said. “But being in prison adds new levels to that questioning, because of the way that people have been treated in prison.”

A two-minute video for the campaign features the voices of inmates who say jail officials are not providing protective equipment or requiring social distancing and have not regularly sanitized shower facilities. The video, shared with The Associated Press ahead of the campaign’s launch, does not identify the inmates or where they are imprisoned.

COVID-19 outbreaks in jails and prisons around the country have caused alarm among advocates, who say inadequate mitigation protocol threatens both the lives of incarcerated people and correctional officers. Last month, the U.S. Bureau of Prisons released data that showed more than 70% of people in federal custody tested for COVID-19 were positive.

Similarly dire outbreaks have been reported in a handful of state-run correctional systems.

In Common’s hometown of Chicago, where the Cook County Jail is one of the nation’s largest jails, a federal judge last month ordered officials to ensure social distancing among the 4,000 people in custody. As of Tuesday, 161 inmates and 81 correctional officers were positive for COVID-19, according to the sheriff’s department. Many more inmates have tested positive but recovered. Seven inmates who have tested positive have died.

Guaranteeing prisoners’ safety during the pandemic is an issue of humanity, not politics, said Sam Lewis, executive director of the California-based Anti-Recidivism Coalition, one of nearly 65 partner organizations in the #WeMatterToo campaign.

“People have made mistakes that put them in jail,” said Lewis, a former life prisoner. “But that does not mean they should just die in those places. Accountability is not a death sentence.”

Before the pandemic, Common’s Imagine Justice group organized regular in-person visits to correctional facilities. Since the pandemic, visitation has been cut off or is severely limited at many facilities.

“Some of the strongest people I’ve ever met are in prison,” Common said. “I believe we can come out of this greater than we were before.”",real

-Drive-in movie theaters — Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo) May 11, 2020

The movie ""Trolls"" will be playing this weekend at the Fingerlakes Drive-In in Auburn, New York, roughly 30 miles from Syracuse, according to its owner, Paul Meyer, a commercial real estate developer who bought the business eight years ago and who estimates there are about 30 drive-ins across the state.

""Drive-ins by design are excellent places to go for social distancing,"" Meyer told CBS MoneyWatch. ""I expect we'll have a good season this year.""

In operation since 1947, the business is the oldest continuously operated drive-in theater in the state, said Meyer, who is still thinking through all the logistics of keeping patrons six feet apart at the concession stand and in lines for the bathroom. His three employees and customers will be required to wear masks, he said.

For now, the pandemic has had little impact on Meyer's drive-in, a seasonal business that would have been closed anyway when the shutdown order came into play in March. ""When COVID hit we were already closed as it was in the middle of winter time,"" he said.

There are 305 drive-in theaters around the U.S., with at least one in every state except for Alaska, Delaware, Hawaii, Louisiana and North Dakota, according to the United Drive-In Theatre Owners Association.

It's not the first time that drive-ins, which first appeared in the U.S. in the years following the Great Depression, have been touted as a refuge from disease. In the early 1950s, when the U.S. faced a major polio epidemic, the theaters sometimes pitched themselves as ""flu and polio protected,"" according to an account by Food and Wine.

""It's a responsibility on our side to be as safe as possible,"" Stephen Sauerbeck, owner of Sauerbeck Family Drive-In Theater in La Grange, Kentucky, told The New York Times.

331,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/15/nyregion/coronavirus-face-masks-andrew-cuomo.html,2020-04-15,New York Orders Residents to Wear Masks in Public,"
Imposing a stricter measure to control the spread of the coronavirus, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said on Wednesday that he would start requiring people in New York to wear masks or face coverings in public whenever social distancing was not possible.
The order will take effect on Friday and will apply to people who are unable to keep six feet away from others in public settings, such as on a bus or subway, on a crowded sidewalk or inside a grocery store.
“Stopping the spread is everything,” Mr. Cuomo said during his daily briefing in Albany. “How can you not wear a mask when you’re going to come close to a person?”
The new requirements are bound to make face coverings an inescapable and perhaps jarring sight in New York City for the foreseeable future. They could also introduce a level of mutual obligation and civic duty about wearing masks in public that is more firmly established in Asia than in the West.
Maryland also announced on Wednesday that it would require people to wear masks in public.Mr. Cuomo said local governments would enforce the order, but he noted that riders without face coverings would not be ejected from public transit. The pandemic has devastated New York’s public transit system, with 59 workers having died of the virus and 2,269 testing positive for the infection.
The state would consider issuing civil penalties to people who fail to abide by the order, but not criminal penalties: “You’re not going to go to jail for not wearing a mask,” Mr. Cuomo said.
Permitted face coverings include proper masks, as well as scarves or bandannas, the governor said.A similar rule was issued in New Jersey last week. The order, issued by Gov. Philip D. Murphy, made it mandatory for all people inside stores and other essential businesses to wear face coverings unless they are under 2 years old or have a medical condition that prevents them from wearing a mask.
Signs have popped up at stores throughout New Jersey warning customers that they will not be allowed in unless they cover their faces. Some stores have taken a stronger stance, asking people without coverings to leave.
“These restrictions that I have laid out must be followed throughout the state,” Mr. Murphy said last week. “We are taking the step to protect both customers and essential workers.”
The mandates were the latest public safety measures from two states that are at the epicenter of the pandemic in the United States. New York and New Jersey have worked in tandem since the outbreak reached the region, shuttering nonessential businesses at the same time and recently forming a coalition with neighboring states to coordinate the reopening of their economies.
In announcing Maryland’s order on masks in public settings, Gov. Larry Hogan said, “The wearing of masks is something we may have to become more accustomed to in order to safely reopen our state.”
New York, New Jersey and Maryland are so far the only states to have issued broad orders mandating face coverings in most public settings, according to the most recent information from the National Governors Association. Puerto Rico and Guam have implemented similar measures.
Nonbinding guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention encourage people to wear face coverings in settings where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain to prevent the transmission of the virus. The infection spreads primarily through droplets generated when, for instance, a sick person coughs or sneezes.
That federal recommendation was issued after research showed that many people were infected with the virus but did not show symptoms.
Across New Jersey, businesses were still grappling with the enforcement of the new rules, which some people have flouted, leading to arrests in some instances.
Supermarkets have posted signs on their doors telling customers they cannot come in without a mask, but some shoppers have refused to wear coverings and laughed off the requirement, said Matt Fattah, the owner of a C-Town supermarket in Jersey City.
“A lot of people think they don’t have to follow the rules,” Mr. Fattah said. “My employees are all on board, wear masks and gloves 100 percent of the time. Customers, first few days, it was an issue. Like the bag ban, a lot of customers thought it was a joke, that we were joking.”
Earlier this week, the owners of a toy store in Lakewood, a town near the Jersey Shore, were charged with violating the order after police spotted about 10 people crowded inside the shop. Only three of them were wearing masks, according to the police.
And in Pleasantville, a town just west of Atlantic City, a 35-year-old man was arrested on several charges, including violating emergency orders, after he came into a Dunkin’ Donuts without a mask and refused to leave after employees asked him to.
Col. Patrick J. Callahan, superintendent of the New Jersey State Police, said the police would continue to cite and arrest those who ignored orders mandating social distancing and the wearing of masks.
“Because lives are at stake, enforcement action will be taken without hesitation against those who are blatantly placing the lives of others at risk,” he said in a statement.
Mr. Murphy, the New Jersey governor, said it was up to businesses to set their own policies on how to deal with customers who do not wear a face covering.
The state order does allow people who refuse to wear a mask for medical or other reasons to enter a store and spend a limited amount of time shopping for essential goods, Parimal Garg, the state’s deputy chief counsel, explained during Mr. Murphy’s briefing on April 8.
“I think that’s benevolent,” Mr. Murphy responded. “I’d prefer to even be tougher than that.”K.C. Rondello, a disaster epidemiologist at the College of Nursing and Public Health at Adelphi University in New York, said the mask requirement would ensure compliance from those who would otherwise ignore voluntary guidelines.
“If ultimately these laws lead to greater compliance with social distancing recommendations, then they will have a very real and quantifiable effect on morbidity and mortality,” he said. “It may be difficult for people to understand or appreciate the value of a face covering. They may think, ‘What could a bandanna possibly do?’ But it can make an enormous difference.”
In New York, Mr. Cuomo said the new measures were necessary as the state continued to rein in the spread of the virus: On Tuesday, the three-day average of the number of virus patients in hospitals — considered one of the most reliable measures of the virus’s impact — fell for the first time since the outbreak began.
“All people in public must have a mask or nose covering, mouth and nose covering, and they must wear it in a situation where you cannot or are not maintaining social distancing,” Mr. Cuomo said.
The governor said a mask was not necessary if, for example, a person was walking down an empty street. But, he said, “You’re now at an intersection and there are people at the intersection and you’re going to be in proximity to other people? Put the mask on.”
He added, “You don’t have a right to infect me.”Kevin Armstrong and Lauren Hard contributed reporting from New Jersey.",real

So, let’s get this straight. At a time when the US is leading the world with deaths and infections from the disease, the Pentagon views flexing muscles with warplanes in the Asia Pacific is somehow a demonstration of American potency.

While the American public is crying out for more resources to cope with the pandemic, Washington sees fit to ramp up militarism not just in the Asia Pacific, but also in the Arctic region, the Persian Gulf and the Caribbean.

US warships despatched to the Caribbean are said to be on a mission to counter-narcotic trafficking. Few people will buy that pretext. The military force is deployed as a threat to Venezuela and its socialist government which the Trump administration has openly targeted for regime change.

A failed coup attempt earlier this month involving a private US mercenary outfit may or may not have had official support from the White House.

But one thing is clear: when Russia proposed a statement of support for Venezuela at the UN Security Council this week in which the failed coup was denounced as a violation of the UN charter forbidding aggression, the draft statement was “killed” by Washington’s envoy.

The implication is that Washington’s public position sees nothing wrong with aggression despite the flagrant violation of international law that it involves.

In that case, it could be expected that the US will attempt to block Iranian oil tankers en route to Venezuela. If aggression is acceptable to Washington then why not also a bit of high-seas piracy?

Five Iranian-flagged tankers are due to dock in the South American country in the coming days. They are reportedly ferrying $45 million worth of gasoline to alleviate Venezuela’s crippled economy as it struggles like many other nations to control the coronavirus pandemic.

Venezuela is a major exporter of crude oil but due to US sanctions its capacity to refine fuel has been decimated. This has caused severe shortages for Venezuelan transport which has, in turn, exacerbated the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Both Venezuela and Iran have warned the US to not interfere in the sea passage of the oil tankers. Both countries have been burdened with American sanctions, but they are legally entitled to conduct bilateral trade. If US warships impede the transport, then it will be viewed by Venezuela and Iran as an act of piracy. We might add that the rest of the world will view it that way too. An act of piracy compounding acts of economic aggression under heartless US sanctions.

Given the pandemic crisis, Iran’s supply of vital fuel to Venezuela is not merely a normal trade transaction, but a courageous act of solidarity and humanitarian aid.

The Trump administration has mischievously indicated it will do something to stop the Iranian ships reaching Venezuela. What that something is open to guesswork. Will it use its warships in the Caribbean to mount a blockade?

Iran has warned it will retaliate. Perhaps by attacking American warships in the Persian Gulf, where skirmishing has already taken place.

Venezuela says it is sending naval forces to escort the Iranian tankers once they arrive in its territorial waters.

In the next coming days, a showdown awaits which could have explosive repercussions, not least because the Iranian tankers are reckoned to contain 1.5 million barrels of gasoline.

The US head of Southern Command, Admiral Craig Faller, this week played down the probability of an armed confrontation with the Iranian vessels.

He is quoted as saying: “You have to ask yourself what interest Iran has in Venezuela, where we have seen recent indications of Iranian military and state support?”

Eh, let’s guess Admiral Faller, maybe simply an act of solidarity by two nations who are under the boot of American imperialism and illegal sanctions that amount to a crime against humanity.

American global power right now is seen as a farce. It has been devastated by a virus and shown to be a lying cheat over its attempt to smear China and the World Health Organization. Its sanctioning against nations struggling with a deadly disease is barbaric terrorism; and while millions of Americans are facing poverty, the US is sending warships and warplanes to all corners of the world.

Washington won’t dare do piracy in the Caribbean at this juncture. Because it can’t afford another fiasco. Its global image is already in tatters.

This article was originally published by John W. Whitehead at The Rutherford Institute.

“You have no right not to be vaccinated, you have no right not to wear a mask, you have no right to open up your business… And if you refuse to be vaccinated, the state has the power to literally take you to a doctor’s office and plunge a needle into your arm.”—Alan Dershowitz, Harvard law professor

You have no rights.

That’s the lesson the government wants us to learn from this COVID-19 business.

Well, the government is wrong.

For years now, the powers-that-be—those politicians and bureaucrats who think like tyrants and act like petty dictators regardless of what party they belong to—have attempted to brainwash us into believing that we have no right to think for ourselves, make decisions about our health, protect our homes and families and businesses, act in our best interests, demand accountability and transparency from government, or generally operate as if we are in control of our own lives.

We have every right, and you know why? Because we were born free.

As the Declaration of Independence states, we are endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights—to life, liberty, property and the pursuit of happiness—that no government can take away from us.

Unfortunately, that hasn’t stopped the government from constantly trying to usurp our freedoms at every turn. Indeed, the nature of government is such that it invariably oversteps its limits, abuses its authority, and flexes its totalitarian muscles.

Take this COVID-19 crisis, for example.

What started out as an apparent effort to prevent a novel coronavirus from sickening the nation (and the world) has become yet another means by which world governments (including our own) can expand their powers, abuse their authority, and further oppress their constituents.

Until now, the police state has been more circumspect in its power grabs, but this latest state of emergency has brought the beast out of the shadows.

We are on a slippery slope to outright despotism.

This road we are traveling is paved with lockdowns, SWAT team raids, mass surveillance and forced vaccinations. It is littered with the debris of our First and Fourth Amendment freedoms.

This is what we have to look forward to in the months and years to come unless we can find some way to regain control over our runaway government.

The government has made no secret of its plans.

Just follow the money trail, and you’ll get a sense of what’s in store: more militarized police, more SWAT team raids, more surveillance, more lockdowns, more strong-armed tactics aimed at suppressing dissent and forcing us to comply with the government’s dictates.

It’s chilling to think about, but it’s not surprising.

We’ve been warned.

Remember that Pentagon training video created by the Army for U.S. Special Operations Command? The one that anticipates the future domestic political and social problems the government is grooming its armed forces to solve through the use of martial law?

The chilling five-minute training video, obtained by The Intercept through a FOIA request and made available online, paints a dystopian picture of the future bedeviled by “criminal networks,” “substandard infrastructure,” “religious and ethnic tensions,” “impoverishment, slums,” “open landfills, over-burdened sewers,” a “growing mass of unemployed,” and an urban landscape in which the prosperous economic elite must be protected from the impoverishment of the have nots.

But here’s the kicker: what they’re really talking about is martial law, packaged as a well-meaning and overriding concern for the nation’s security.

This COVID-19 crisis is pushing us that much closer to that dystopian vision becoming a present-day reality.

For starters, let’s talk about the COVID-19 stormtroopers, SWAT team raids, and ongoing flare-ups of police brutality.

With millions of dollars in stimulus funds being directed towards policing agencies across the country, the federal government plans to fight this COVID-19 virus with riot gear, gas masks, ballistic helmets, drones, and hi-tech surveillance technology.

Indeed, although crime rates have fallen dramatically in the midst of this global COVID-19 lockdown, there’s been no relief from the brutality and violence of the American police state.

While the majority of the country has been social distancing under varying degrees of lockdowns, it’s been business as usual for the nation’s SWAT teams and police trained to shoot first and ask questions later.

In Kentucky, plain-clothed cops in unmarked cars used a battering ram to break down Breonna Taylor’s door and carry out a no-knock raid on her home after midnight. Fearing a home invasion, the 26-year-old emergency medical technician and her boyfriend—who had been in bed at the time of the invasion—called 911 and prepared to defend themselves. Taylor’s boyfriend shot one of the intruders—later identified as police—in the leg. Police fired at least 20 shots into the apartment and a neighboring home, killing Taylor. The drug dealer who was the target of the late-night raid lived 10 miles away and had already been arrested prior to the raid on Taylor’s home.

In Illinois, police opened fire in a subway station, shooting a 33-year-old man who allegedly resisted their attempts to tackle and arrest him for violating a city ordinance by passing between two cars of a moving train. Ariel Roman, a short-order cook, claimed he was suffering from an anxiety attack when he was “harassed, chased, tackled, pepper-sprayed, tasered and shot twice” by police.

In Maryland, police dispatched on a nuisance call to break up a crowd of neighborhood kids( half of them teenagers, and the other half youngsters around 4 and 5 years old) gathered in an apartment complex parking lot opened fire on a 29-year-old man seen exiting his car with a gun. An eyewitness claimed “the officer pointed a flashlight and his gun at the group immediately and began chasing and shooting a minute or two after getting out of the patrol car.” Police reportedly shot the man after he threw down his gun and ran in the opposite direction.

In Virginia, more than 80 local, state, and federal police agents risked spreading COVID-19 to “a highly vulnerable population” when they raided a low income, public housing community in an effort to crackdown on six individuals suspected of selling, on average, $20 to $100 worth of drugs.

In Texas, a SWAT team backed up with a military tank Armored Personnel Carrier raided Big Daddy Zane’s Bar whose owner and patrons were staging a peaceful First and Second Amendment protest of the governor’s shutdown orders.

Police have even been called out to shut down churches, schools and public parks and beaches that have been found “in violation” of various lockdown orders.

Now there’s talk of mobilizing the military to deliver forced vaccinations, mass surveillance in order to carry out contact tracing, and heavy fines and jail time for those who dare to venture out without a mask, congregate in worship without the government’s blessing or re-open their businesses without the government’s say-so.

There are rumblings that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) will start thermal screenings to monitor passengers’ temperatures in the coming weeks. This is in addition to the virtual strip searches that have become routine aspects of airport security.

Restaurants in parts of the country are being tasked with keeping daily logs of phone numbers, emails, and arrival times for everybody who participates in dine-services, with no mention of how long such records will be kept on file, with whom they will be shared, and under what circumstances.

With the help of Google and Nest cameras, hospitals are morphing into real-time surveillance centers with round-the-clock surveillance cameras monitoring traffic in patients’ rooms. Forget patient privacy, however. Google has a track record of sharing surveillance footage with police.

And then rounding out the power-grabs, the Senate just voted to give police access to web browsing data without a warrant, which would dramatically expand the government’s Patriot Act surveillance powers. The Senate also voted to give Attorney General William Barr the ability to look through the web browsing history of any American — including journalists, politicians, and political rivals — without a warrant, just by saying it is relevant to an investigation. If enacted, privacy experts warn that the new provisions threaten to undermine the free press by potentially preventing the media from exposing abuses of power or acting as a watchdog against political leaders.

If we haven’t already crossed over, we’re skating dangerously close to that line that keeps us on the functioning side of a constitutional republic. It won’t take much to push us over that edge into a full-blown banana republic.

In many ways, this is just more of the same heavy-handed tactics we’ve been seeing in recent years but with one major difference: this COVID-19 state of emergency has invested government officials (and those who view their lives as more valuable than ours) with a sanctimonious, self-righteous, arrogant, Big Brother Knows Best approach to top-down governing, and the fall-out can be seen far and wide.

It’s an ugly, self-serving mindset that views the needs, lives and rights of “we the people” as insignificant when compared to those in power.

That’s how someone who should know better such as Alan Dershowitz, a former Harvard law professor, can suggest that a free people—born in freedom, endowed by their Creator with inalienable rights, and living in a country birthed out of a revolutionary struggle for individual liberty—have no rights to economic freedom, to bodily integrity, or to refuse to comply with a government order with which they disagree.

According to Dershowitz, who has become little more than a legal apologist for the power elite, “You have no right not to be vaccinated, you have no right not to wear a mask, you have no right to open up your business… And if you refuse to be vaccinated, the state has the power to literally take you to a doctor’s office and plunge a needle into your arm.”

Dershowitz is wrong: while the courts may increasingly defer to the government’s brand of Nanny State authoritarianism, we still have rights.

The government may try to abridge those rights, it may refuse to recognize them, it may even attempt to declare martial law and nullify them, but it cannot litigate, legislate or forcefully eradicate them out of existence.

Up to now, we’ve been largely passive participants in this experiment in self-governance. Our inaction and inattention has left us at the mercy of power-hungry politicians, corrupt corporations, and brutal, government-funded militias.

Wake up, America.

As I make clear in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People, these ongoing violations of our rights—this attitude by the government that we have no rights—this tyrannical movement that is overtaking our constitutional republic and gaining in momentum and power by the minute—this incessant auction block in which government officials appointed to represent our best interests keep selling us out to the highest bidder—all of these betrayals scream for a response.

To quote the great Rod Serling: “If we don’t listen to that scream—and if we don’t respond to it—we may well wind up sitting amidst our own rubble, looking for the truck that hit us—or the bomb that pulverized us. Get the license number of whatever it was that destroyed the dream. And I think we will find that the vehicle was registered in our own name.”",fake

The Federal Correctional Complex in Oakdale, La., is the site of the first fatal coronavirus outbreak in the federal prison system. F.C.C. Oakdale — which houses some 2,000 inmates and employs close to 500 staff members in two low-security prisons (Federal Correctional Institution Oakdale I and F.C.I. Oakdale II) as well as a minimum-security camp — provides the economic lifeblood for a town of fewer than 8,000 people and the surrounding parish. Many of F.C.C. Oakdale’s inmates are serving sentences for nonviolent offenses, like drug sales and financial fraud.
The Bureau of Prisons maintains that it began preparing for the coronavirus outbreak in January. On March 26, Attorney General William P. Barr advised Bureau of Prisons officials that certain “at-risk inmates who are nonviolent and pose a minimal likelihood of recidivism” might be released to serve out their sentences in home confinement, under terms included in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act.
On March 28, Patrick Jones, 49, who was serving a 27-year sentence at Oakdale for possession of crack cocaine with intent to distribute, became the first federal inmate in the country to die from the virus. On April 3, Barr ordered federal prison officials to speed the release of “vulnerable inmates” from at least three federal institutions fighting major coronavirus outbreaks, including F.C.C. Oakdale. By the third week of April, seven Oakdale inmates had died. At least 100 inmates and staff members had been infected, with more than 20 hospitalized, as confusion, fear and anger gripped the interconnected community of inmates, officials, workers, family members and loved ones.Interviews have been condensed and edited for clarity. Several correctional officers requested anonymity for fear of retaliation.

Alice Jones, Patrick Jones’s mother: I talked to him in March — he always called me once a month — and I told him, “I love you, baby,” and he said, “I love you, Mama.” And that was the last time I talked to him. He was not sick. No sniffling, no coughing, nothing.
Correctional Officer 1: Me and another staff member took out an inmate to the hospital. We took him out on a Thursday [March 19]. We were told, “Oh, he has asthma.” It’s routine to take inmates that have health issues out on emergency medical trips. He said he was short of breath, couldn’t breathe. They gave him a mask. We weren’t offered any kind of protection.
Ronald Morris, correctional officer, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 1007: I got a phone call saying we had an inmate go out with Covid-19 symptoms. And yeah, they told the staff he had asthma, and I think it was even on the paperwork that he had asthma, but then they sent him out with a mask. So, hell, yeah, it was very disturbing that they sent the inmate out with a mask and didn’t provide it to staff.
Correctional Officer 1: We checked him into the emergency room, and about an hour and a half later, they moved him from a regular E.R. room to a negative-pressure room, and that’s when they had us put masks on, but I’d already been around him without a mask on. No one told us he might have Covid-19. They said, “Hey, he got asthma issues.” Two days later, I got a call telling me he’d tested positive for the virus.
Alice Jones: They lied. He did not have a longtime chronic illness. No asthma. He did 100 push-ups a day.
Christopher Walker, Patrick Jones’s son: I didn’t know about it until my grandmother called me at like 1 o’clock in the morning. I don’t see how it just took him down like that.
Claudette Crumpton, Patrick Jones’s former girlfriend: He was as healthy as a bull. I always heard in prison the doctors don’t properly take care of them. If they fill out a piece of paper saying they sick, they wait a couple of days to get permission to see the doctor. And then they wait until they get damn near to their deathbed.
Ronald Morris: We found out that Jones tested positive for Covid-19 on the 21st. That’s when we locked down both institutions. And we had our second confirmed case that day also. He went to the hospital. On the 22nd, both C.O.s who took Jones to the hospital were cleared to return to work.
Correctional Officer 1: I got a call telling me I was on administrative leave. And then seven hours later, roughly, a supervisor calls and says, “Y’all are good to come back to work.” I was upset. I mean, you already know you’re exposed to it, but you know, got to pay the bills.
Gene Paul, the Republican mayor of Oakdale: I knew about that first inmate who went to the hospital and tested positive, and I knew that a corrections officer had transported him without a mask. But I didn’t know that his wife and daughter work here at City Hall. When I come to work Monday morning [March 23], his wife tells me that her husband was that correctional officer. I was like, “What?!” I sent them home and said not to come back for 14 days.

On March 28, nine days after being admitted to the hospital, Patrick Jones was pronounced dead. The federal Bureau of Prisons claimed Jones had “long-term, pre-existing medical conditions which the C.D.C. lists as risk factors for developing more severe Covid-19 disease.”
Don Cain, inmate at F.C.I. Oakdale I, via email: I will tell you how I heard the virus got in. I was told that a staff member from education bragged about going to New York City. The first death of an inmate was a guy who was in contact with that staff member. I heard that staff member was supposedly in critical condition in the hospital on a ventilator.
Wife of an F.C.C. Oakdale correctional officer, via Facebook Messenger: There’s also a rumor saying an inmate came off the bus as a new intake, and he brought it in.
Mayor Paul: As of last week [the week of March 30], they were still bringing inmates in from other facilities. It took them about a week to stop those buses. There was a lot of the ball being passed around with, “It’s not my responsibility, it’s the marshals’ responsibility, it’s not our responsibility, it’s somebody else’s.” Well, whose responsibility is it to stop this? I mean, I love the B.O.P. being here and everything, but you think you would have taken some precaution 10 or 14 days earlier to be halfway ready for this thing, especially when you got about 2,000 inmates and about 500 employees.
Correctional Officer 2: I know there was a conversation with the warden. It was myself and one of the case managers that I used to work with — who tested positive, by the way, he’s been out for a week, week and a half — he questioned the warden and said, “What do you think about this coronavirus, do you think we’re going to have a problem?” And he said: “Oh, no, because we live in the South, and it’s warm here. We won’t have any problems.” That was his exact words. Nobody gave us new direction on what we should be doing, how we should be preparing, what to look for, anything.
Ronald Morris: We tried to talk to the warden about safety protocols. I’d say as early as March 18 we talked to him about cross-contamination among the staff. We suggested we keep staff contained and not let them work between institutions. But the warden said he didn’t think that was needed at this time.

Oakdale prison officials including the warden, Rod Myers, did not respond to multiple detailed requests for comment.
Kirk Brannan, recently released from Oakdale prison camp: What happens is that the correction officers and administrators come and go between the facilities and between us and the civilian population. So if any one of them gets exposed, then they’re going to expose us.
Ronald Morris: I’d brought up in our daily meetings that the staff going on medical trips needed P.P.E. But it took them several days to issue N95s, so at first they wore surgical masks. Then the guys did have N95s, but we had not been properly trained to make sure we are doing this properly. And at times there have been shifts they would go work without being protected at all. On March 25, we had six inmates in the hospital for Covid. Each inmate requires two staff to watch him per eight-hour shift. On March 26, we had three confirmed staff with Covid-19.
Mayor Paul: We’re a close-knit community — everyone knows everyone, so there is a lot of concern and uncertainty. About 50 percent of the people in the surrounding area work at the prison, and the ones that live in Oakdale, they go to work, and then they go home and back into the community, go to stores, that kind of thing. When that first inmate tested positive, I called the warden, but he hadn’t returned my calls. Now I have people calling in asking me questions about what’s going on, and I couldn’t really tell them anything because I didn’t know anything. People just want to hear something. Just like, “Everything’s going to be OK,” or, “I spoke with the warden, and he said they’re working on this and everything’s going to be OK.” But I didn’t really have that information. So I called up my state representative, and he was getting calls about some of the same things, and the warden had never returned his call either. And then he called our U.S. congressman, Mike Johnson’s office, and Senator Bill Cassidy.
Ronald Morris: Our warden said he was writing the playbook. I cannot tell you how many times I heard the phrase that we were “writing the playbook” for the B.O.P. to handle this kind of thing when it reached other facilities. I mean, if we were writing the playbook, we were in a ditch.

Mandatory daily temperature checks of every inmate began on March 26. To house sick inmates, prison officials converted half a housing unit in Oakdale I to quarantine inmates who had been exposed to the coronavirus or were exhibiting symptoms.
Don Cain, via email: A guy they brought over to our pod had a cough. I had no symptoms whatsoever, and neither did the other four guys in my pod, but they told us to pack up, we were going to quarantine. I for sure thought I was next to die, as I have diabetes, and they say that having diabetes, it’s the one that is the hardest to fight the virus. I just knew they were going to stick me in there with someone who was sick, and I would contract it and would not be able to fight it and pass away. I was praying, asking God not to let them take me over there to that death unit.
Correctional Officer 3: We got three inmates getting tested to see if they had the virus, and we put them on a range, which is a straight hall that got cells. I fed those guys. I wore gloves. I didn’t wear masks. I didn’t think they had it. But turns out all three of them tested positive. And they went out to hospitals. It was just a wake-up call for me.
Correctional Officer 1: It took a little while to wrap your head around that it is a big deal. Then probably Thursday [March 26], I went to sit on one inmate at one of the local hospitals, and they gave us the little yellow paper gowns to put over our uniforms, and the N95 masks and gloves and goggles. But the nursing staff were coming in like they were about to take a spacewalk — the helmets, you know?
Ronald Morris: We had inmates at four local hospitals. At the hospital 40 miles away, they have a suit they wear with the helmet. Our staff don’t. I think half of a whole floor is negative pressure. At another hospital, we got patients in a regular I.C.U., and we sit outside a glass partition so we can observe the patient. They also have some inmates in regular rooms, and the staff are sitting in the room with them. Those are not negative pressure. At one hospital, staff had N95s, gloves and gowns. The health care workers have on the same thing. There are two negative-pressure rooms, and you sit in a vestibule and observe the inmate through the glass wall. The inmate is restrained to the bed, so if something happens to the inmate, we got to go in and remove restraints.

On March 27, five plaintiffs, including three employees at F.C.C. Oakdale, filed a class-action suit on behalf of all federal employees claiming that since Jan. 27, they had “performed work with or in close proximity to objects, surfaces and/or individuals infected with the novel coronavirus,” and asking for hazard pay.
Anita Kadrovich, correctional officer: For probably over a year and a half or so, my job was to take inmates to their medical appointments. I have rheumatoid arthritis; it’s an autoimmune disease. So I do low-dose chemo every week, which wipes out my ability to fight off anything. I have no immune system. My doctor told me I should not be around any of it. He sent me a letter. But I didn’t turn the letter in. I didn’t want to leave my people stranded — it’s like leaving a man behind.
Ronald Morris: Jones died on the 28th, and by then, we probably had up to about 12 inmates in the hospital, and another confirmed staff with Covid. On the 29th, we had seven confirmed staff. Then it just hit the accelerator, and it went fast. You had inmates going to the hospital by ambulance, two or three a day. I was pleading with the warden for help — we just didn’t have enough staff. And we were forcing staff to work 30 or 40 hours straight.
Kirk Brannan: At the camp, there’s two large dorms filled with bunk beds stacked end to end, three feet apart widthwise. So when you’re sleeping on your bunk bed, you’re within three feet of 12 people snoring and breathing hard. So there’s a lot of common breaths going on in there. It’s the epitome of an environment that can spread the virus if any one person gets it.
Ronald Morris: On March 30, we had 15 inmates in the hospital with Covid. We had seven positive staff and 16 staff out awaiting tests. On the 31st, we had 17 inmates in the hospital and eight staff positive, with a lot of people awaiting results. Then the second inmate died on April 1, and by then we was running. First we had 10 positive staff. At noon that day, we had 13 positive staff. By 5 o’clock that evening, we had 17 positive staff. It was very chaotic and stressful. Most of the guys that tested positive were either working in the housing units or sitting on Covid-19 patients in the hospital. In the housing units, they were only wearing surgical masks. They say if you work in an isolation unit, you must wear an N95, but where do you think these inmates are coming from? They’re coming from a housing unit where they won’t give you that mask. That’s our biggest bitch. How is it that you don’t wear the N95 mask where the symptoms originate from? If an inmate gets sick in this area and lives in that area, you don’t wear a mask, but if you put him in an isolation area, you wear a mask.

On March 31, the Bureau of Prisons ordered a 14-day lockdown across the federal prison system: “Inmates in every institution will be secured in their assigned cells/quarters to decrease the spread of the virus.” The lockdown permitted inmates in small groups to use the phones, computers, showers, commissary and laundry facilities.
Kirk Brannan: They have the camp inmates making sack meals, bag meals, for those who are on lockdown. They’re going on three and a half weeks of living on bologna sandwiches and peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches. That’s all they get to eat for dinner or lunch. They get a little packet of cereal for breakfast. Inmates at the camp are making those bags, and we don’t know if anybody infected is making those bags or not. They’re not testing. You would think if you have a potential of having an infection, you’d have to be tested before you get to handle people’s food. Well, that’s not being done.
Ronald Morris: We have, as of about an hour ago [on April 2], 20 staff who’ve tested positive for the virus. We probably got that many out at home waiting on test results. And that changes hourly. We have approximately 18 inmates in the hospital. We got approximately 40 or so inmates in isolation; these inmates are showing symptoms of Covid-19. We got over 80 inmates quarantined that have been exposed. Both of those numbers are growing daily. I am in the community hospital working, and I’m looking at the inmate through glass in the bed. He’s sleeping. I hope he doesn’t die on my shift.

On April 2, an inmate at the minimum-security prison camp who was exhibiting symptoms was tested for Covid-19. Anita Kadrovich had been transferred to work at the camp a few days earlier.
Anita Kadrovich: We thought we were fairly safe out here, but no. When the first inmate got sick, people started looking around and started getting worried. You could just tell on their faces. Everybody was like: Oh, my gosh, it’s here. I felt the same way. When they came out to quarantine the first inmate, they had their hats on, they had their N95s on, they had the surgical mask over their N95. They had the gowns on, they had their feet covered, everything.
Correctional Officer 2: That same day, I asked the acting health-services administrator for an N95 mask, and she told me I didn’t need one. At the same time, she and all three of the nurses that were with her had on full protective gear. But I was told the surgical mask that had been provided was good enough. And that wasn’t the first time that we here at the camp had been denied. We’d requested masks two other times and were told, “You don’t need it.” They never gave us a reason other than, “Well, until there’s a positive case,” and now they tell us they aren’t testing because they assume if someone has symptoms, they have it.
Anita Kadrovich: And right after the first inmate was taken to quarantine, they called for safety to come out and decontaminate the health-service department. The safety guy told me that when he walked into the health-service department without his mask on, they were like: “No, no, put your mask on! That inmate was all around and in here!” So I’m like: “It was that serious for y’all, what about all of us? He was in our offices cleaning our doorknobs. Do we need to be decontaminated?” But they didn’t tell us any of that.
Correctional Officer 2: That inmate was one of our orderlies, so he was walking around without a mask every hour cleaning every door handle in the entire camp. He’d exhibited symptoms the previous week. He’d had a fever. And we requested the protective equipment, but they wouldn’t give it to us because they said we didn’t need it. They had a little dust mask, like a painter’s mask, and a pair of gloves that they would give us, but it’s nothing.
Anita Kadrovich: I feel like we’re guinea pigs.Kirk Brannan: Everything they’ve done has been really kind of the opposite of what they should have done. I can’t tell you how many guys, when I was leaving, came up to me and said: “Please get our story out there.” Something’s got to happen before something catastrophic happens.
Ronald Morris: You got the director of the B.O.P. saying they’ve been preparing since January, and they have a national stockpile of supplies. Well, where the hell are those supplies? Why can’t we get some? They did send us some national-stockpile N95 masks. Want to know how many? Two hundred! Two hundred! They couldn’t afford to give us any more. They know that we’re just the first institution that’s going to be dealing with this, so they need to hold it to ration it out to other institutions because they know their national stockpile is insufficient to begin with.
Heidi Burakiewicz, lead attorney on the federal class-action lawsuit: What I am constantly hearing from workers at Oakdale is that they’re looking for guidance, and they’re getting no guidance or contradictory guidance, or it’s constantly changing. I’m outraged when I hear people tell me: “I rode in a van with a sick inmate, and I asked for a mask, and they said: No, I didn’t need it.” Or: “I sat in a room in the hospital with a sick inmate, and I didn’t even have a mask on.” Or: “It was only a surgical mask.” That makes me angry. That was preventable. Somebody in this agency needs to take responsibility and start protecting these people.
Ronald Morris, via text, April 3: Five inmate deaths. Eighteen inmates in hospital, 727 inmates quarantined in five housing units. Two staff in hospital.
Don Cain, via email: A guy from our unit passed away. I did speak with him on a daily basis, so that hit home to actually know someone who was alive just last week and he is no longer here.
Correctional Officer 3: Inmates get sick with the coronavirus, and they don’t want to say anything until it’s so bad that we got to rush them out on the ambulance so they don’t die. We had one guy, he was about to die, and his cellmate waves over the corrections officer, and he was like: “Hey, uh, this guy’s not doing so well.” And then they had to put him on oxygen and rush him out to the hospital. He just laid in his bed, and he didn’t want to go to another unit, and he didn’t want to go to the hospital. All the inmates are scared because they don’t know what’s going to happen if they get it.
Don Cain, via email: People are scared and worried. They ask questions and complain, but we are told half-truths, kept in the dark.
Ronald Morris: We’ve had staff working 24 to 32 and 40 hours of overtime. You don’t have nobody to come relieve you sitting at the hospital, and inmates is going out left and right. We’re 50 minutes from the institution, so you got at least an hour’s drive. I had an officer that got to work at 6 that morning and volunteered to work at the hospital to relieve a staff member so they could go home. Ended at midnight and never got relieved, drove back to the institution because he had another shift to pull there and fell asleep three times on the highway. We cannot abandon the hospital post that we’re on or abandon the security that we’re providing for that inmate because we’ll face disciplinary action. We all take an oath to protect the public, to protect the institution, to protect each other and government property. We have a no-strike clause in our union contract. We’re bound by an oath kind of like the military to protect and serve.
Correctional Officer 2: Originally, they gave us a form, and it asked if you’d been exposed, if you had any symptoms, if you had seasonal allergies, how long you had seasonal allergies. Now all they’re doing is checking our temperature. You pull up, they put a little forehead thermometer and check your temperature: “OK, you want a mask and gloves? Go on in.” No “How are you feeling? Do you have body aches, are you nauseated? Do you have a cough, a runny nose, any of that?” We’re not questioned at all.
Anita Kadrovich: At 99 degrees, they clear you to come in. So you could have symptoms, and you could have been undetected.
Ronald Morris: If they let everybody self-quarantine, there ain’t nobody to work in the prison, and the bureau is not going to do that. So they’re going to make the excuse of “We’re doing enhanced screening to catch it, come back to work.” That’s their answer. Is it the right answer? Hell, no, it’s not the right answer. But what is the right answer? You know, where do you get the help from? I had to pressure the warden to ask for temporary-duty staff to come and assist us. Our national union was telling us that they had people in the regional office ready to assist us, and I asked him if he knew about it, and he said no, and he said: “I don’t know if we need them.” And I said: ‘‘We need help! We can’t keep going at this pace. Will you ask for help?’' I had to ask him two or three times. They started showing up late March.
Mayor Paul: I spoke with the warden on Saturday [April 4], and I mean, this guy sounded like he was fixing to explode. You could hear it in his voice, I mean, exhaustion. I feel sorry for him. He just said it’s been such chaos out there for the last couple of weeks.
Correctional Officer 3: I’m not one of the people stuck working in the medical unit. If I was, I’d be worried every day. We’ve had staff members get sick because of having to work at the hospital for so long.

Since the outbreak began, a number of correctional officers who believe they were exposed to the virus say they have requested extra sick leave to self-quarantine but have been denied. Those who have taken time off anyway risk being designated “absent without leave” by their supervisors.
Correctional Officer 2: A memo is done saying a staff member was placed on AWOL because of “abuse of sick leave.” And that’s what they consider it. If you miss more than three days, you have to have a doctor’s note. And then when they place you on AWOL, the memo goes to the warden, and well, this warden, he refers every single case for disciplinary. The common thing is you get like three days without pay, if you abuse sick leave, and then it just climbs from there. I think one staff member spent 10 days without pay for abuse of sick leave.
Anita Kadrovich: A woman I know, she’s a single mom, and they mandatoried her to go work where all the quarantined inmates are. She broke down and cried because she just thought that was her death sentence. She has two girls, and she was like: “I just know I’m going to get it.” But she went. She sucked it up because that’s what we do. Can’t cry in prison. It’s harder for us women than it is as men, because we’ve got to show that we can do the same job they can do. And it’s mostly a man’s world inside the prison, so as women we have to suck it up and do everything just like the men do. And crying is not an option.
Jordan Cain, Don Cain’s daughter: We live in Wyoming, and, you know, we don’t know anything about Oakdale or anything like that. I know my dad, I feel like he’s scared. He hasn’t called me today [April 3]. So I’m a little worried already ’cause that was kind of one of his things, like, to make sure he calls us every day so we know he’s safe. He did have a heart attack last year. I mean, I am a little nervous right now.

Ronald Morris, via text, April 5: Twenty inmates placed among four local hospitals. Seven inmates in I.C.U. Four on ventilator. Twenty-one staff positive.
Kirk Brannan: The most important thing to me right now is to try to help some of these other guys get out. And I think the tools are in place to do that, if people who can exercise the tools will do so. I think the issue is the B.O.P. is a big bureaucracy. And like any typical bureaucracy, when something comes up that has to be done, it just takes some time to get it done. And because of that, they’re ignoring the severity of the emergency. The first guy left about five days before me; he had filed a petition for compassionate release a year ago. He’s 72 years old, has some health issues. I’m 66.
Don Cain, via email: Do you know anything about the CARES Act? I know I should qualify for what I hear are the standards.
Anita Kadrovich: They have let a few out on compassionate release. So a lot of the older inmates — the majority of our campers are older, and they all have medical issues — they are panicking. They’re doing anything they can to get their paperwork in to do compassionate releases, and case managers are getting overwhelmed with all the paperwork coming in for that. Families call and ask if we can pay for them to be furloughed or in a hotel room or let them come home, and I have to say it’s not my decision.

On April 6, the inmate at the prison camp who was tested for Covid-19 received a positive test result. The following day, a second camp inmate reported Covid-19-related symptoms and was placed in isolation.
Ronald Morris, via email, April 7: The camp is now on quarantine. The warden allowed cross-contamination to affect the camp staff and inmates.
Correctional Officer 2: Right now I’m looking at the front of the unit. And we have a piece of paper on the door where everybody goes in, and it says: “This unit is quarantined. Proper P.P.E. is required.” But all these inmates, they’re all in their dorms. They’re cleaning the floors, cleaning the bathrooms and the showers and pretty much doing their normal routines. I mean, they’re still in the dorm within arm’s length away from each other. On quarantine.
Don Cain, via email: We have no gloves. Only orderlies get gloves, and they wipe down phones and computers once a day, not after every use.
Anita Kadrovich: The community is scared to death of people who work out here. I don’t take it to heart when they turn around in the aisle at Walmart because I have my uniform on and kind of run the other way. I just grab a few things and be gone. I got pulled over for speeding, and the cop found out where I worked at. He backed away from my car and said: “Have a good day!” Southern people, we want to hug everybody. I am a hugger. But no, not now.
Correctional Officer 3: I mean, I completely understand where they’re coming from, but I have never had people like — they’re scared of us. They don’t want to get infected. I try not to go anywhere after work until I change clothes. I just get home, strip, dump everything in a wash and wash it a few times, because I don’t know what I came in contact with.
Wife of C.O.: It is very scary. We have to relive, every day, being scared that my husband has contracted this virus and that he might not be showing any symptoms. We are trying to be very cautious when he comes home. He literally strips down on our back patio, sprays his clothes, shoes, even work bag and hat down daily with Lysol before coming in the house through our sitting area in our bedroom to thoroughly shower. Then he tries to distance himself from us. But it’s so difficult trying to explain to a 2- and 3-year-old that they can’t hug or sit with Daddy.

Ronald Morris, via text, April 8: All of F.C.I. I is in quarantine. And now the prison camp is in quarantine. Forty-five positive inmates in both places. Fifty-three inmates in isolation. Three on ventilators. Six in I.C.U. Twenty-two staff positive. I lost count of staff awaiting results.
Wife of C.O.: My husband is trying to find an urgent care or doctor that will test him. He has a few symptoms but isn’t running a fever, therefore no one will test him. We’ve called several urgent cares and several doctor’s offices, no luck. The E.R. said they changed criteria today to qualify for testing. So we are hoping to be able to get him tested today. He has a cough, and he can’t smell. He said he’s feeling kind of off.
Anita Kadrovich: I should get my test results later today. I have a few symptoms, but it could be my rheumatoid arthritis, because I’ve been off my medicine because it drops my immune system. So to try to build my immune system up so I can continue to work without worrying about catching it. I just quit taking my medicine.
Don Cain, via email: There is still scared people and tension in the air, and you can feel the frustration of being kept inside without going outside except to get your meal. There is a lot of bickering at each other, sense of hostility toward each other like something is going to explode.

On April 8, a violent clash between inmates and correctional officers at Oakdale I occurred after the officers tried to reintegrate a group of prisoners from the isolation unit into the general population.
Ronald Morris: The administration screwed up. These inmates were over the Covid-19 virus, but they weren’t supposed to be released back out there yet, and so when they realized this, they went back an hour and a half later and grabbed ’em and put them back in the isolation unit. And when they did that, that freaked those inmates out because they’re scared of getting this [expletive], and they thought they’d just released the virus into that unit and contaminated them. The problem was, they didn’t educate the inmates on what’s going on. It’s basic corrections 101, communicating with the inmate population. Go down there and town hall them and educate them. They didn’t do that — they kicked ’em out and then jerked them back up, and you think, Oh, hell, they just brought an infected person down here, and now we’re all going to get this [expletive].
Don Cain, via email: I know one thing is, if I do pass, my family has one heck of a suit.
On April 17, a Bureau of Prisons spokeswoman responded to a detailed request for comment with a statement: “We want to point out that following a recent visit to F.C.C. Oakdale, the C.D.C. and the Louisiana Office of Public Health commended F.C.C. Oakdale staff and confirmed their compliance with current C.D.C. guidance for Covid management in correctional facilities. We direct you to our public website for detailed information about how the B.O.P. is taking aggressive steps to mitigate the spread of Covid in all of our facilities, including F.C.C. Oakdale.”
Ronald Morris, via text, April 10: Another inmate death — six. Positive inmates: 49. Positive staff: 26.
Correctional Officer 1: You don’t know. This could be the day that you have a temperature. Or this is going to be the day that you come in contact with somebody that’s going to get you sick. Every day when I come home kind of starts my 14 days over, where I can’t have contact with my family. It’s weighing on my wife, and it’s weighing on me. I’m starting to become a little withdrawn and short. I know that my stress rubs on to her and then rubs off to the kids. And it’s not just us. I’m sure it’s the health care providers, I’m sure it’s the local parish and state law enforcement, federal law enforcement, firefighters. I mean, we all probably feel the exact same way. We have no choice.
Mayor Paul: We don’t have a morgue at the Oakdale hospital. They have run in a portable morgue. It’s an 18-wheeler on the loading dock. I understand it is for all the surrounding hospitals if needed.
Correctional Officer 2: We’re still releasing inmates if it’s time for them to be released. When they’re going to leave here, they’re going to get on a Greyhound bus, probably change two or three different buses. One’s going, let’s say, to Houston, one is going to Georgia; we send inmates all over the United States. We send inmates to Puerto Rico. We send inmates everywhere. I have brought up that if we know that they’re getting out, then why are we not putting them in quarantine? Because an inmate could not have a fever 12 hours before he leaves, get on a plane or a bus, and as soon as he gets home, he tests positive. Well, then he’s contaminated all those people.
Ronald Morris: On Monday [April 13], the U.S. Marshals showed up with two what they said were “recovered” Covid-19 inmates and said we had to take ’em. So they’re quarantined. And I was very upset — my next question was: “Are we going to be the Covid-19 hub around here?” And they were like: “No, no, this is supposed to be a one-time deal.” But we’ll see.

On April 15, a seventh inmate died. Twenty inmates were hospitalized. Fifty-six inmates had tested positive for Covid-19. Thirty-two staff members had tested positive, along with three of their family members.
Correctional Officer 2: We just want to be protected. That’s all. My husband works here. And we have three children. I have elderly parents, his mother’s elderly. We don’t want to give this to anybody. And it’s terrifying whenever we hear, you know, somebody else has it, somebody else has it. We live here. This is where we’re from. This is our home.

The tests were carried out by the Asociacion Ecuatoriana de Medicos Expertos en Medicina Integrativa, a group of integrative medicine practitioners.

Ecuador has been hit particularly hard by the coronavirus, and the current “standard of care” promoted by Western medicine — largely based on the use of ventilators — has been killing the vast majority of critical patients while utterly failing to address the real root of the problem.

Covid-19 isn’t an Acute Respiratory Disease (ARD), it turns out.

Rather, it often presents as an inflammation and blood clotting condition (see The Lancet research, below) which causes the blood to be unable to carry oxygen, resulting in patient hypoxia and eventual asphyxiation.

This is why intravenous chlorine dioxide — which immediately delivers a high dose of oxygen to blood cells — is believed to work so effectively against covid-19.

It reportedly restores the oxygen-carrying capacity of hemoglobin and clears the clotting in the lungs, all while destroying pathogens.

Chlorine dioxide researcher and advocate Andreas Kalcker has posted a video (in Spanish) where he explains the findings.

That video, entitled, “Mas de 100 Casos de Covid-19 recuperados con CDS por medicos de Aememi,” is found at this link on Lbry.tv.

A video embed is offered here:

In the video, Andreas explains that researchers were able to achieve a complete cure in just four days through the use of intravenous chlorine dioxide (ClO2).

Here’s a photo of some of the researchers holding syringes of chlorine dioxide, which is then infused into the patients’ blood, where it releases a wave of oxygen that researchers believe saturates the blood with O2 while killing pathogens:

Another clinical trial involving chlorine dioxide is currently under way, documented by the US National Library of Medicine at ClinicalTrials.gov.

The study uses oral chlorine dioxide (rather than intravenous) and is entitled, “Determination of the Effectiveness of Oral Chlorine Dioxide in the Treatment of COVID 19.”

The trial is being conducted by the Genesis Foundation and involves 20 patients.

The ClinicalTrials.gov identifier for that trial is NCT04343742.

Andreas Kalcker explains in his video that chlorine dioxide is a powerful disinfectant that destroys viruses and bacteria.

The substance has long been used in water purification processes and is approved by various US government agencies for as a water treatment and purification agent.

This video frame shows blood cells being flooded with oxygen from ClO2, instantly reducing clotting / coagulation:

Covid-19 is not an acute respiratory disease

In another bombshell science paper published May 7, 2020, in The Lancet, researchers Dennis McGonagle and others determined that covid-19 is not a respiratory disease but rather “diffuse pulmonary intravascular coagulopathy,” a kind of blood clotting that presents in lung tissue.

This explains why patients with covid-19 are dying from hypoxia (lack of oxygen) and are frequently killed by the use of ventilators.

As an ICU doctor from New York warned months ago, doctors are treating the wrong disease.

(That doctor’s YouTube channel was deleted and all his videos were censored, of course. No one is allowed to question medical orthodoxy in the medical police state known as the United States of America.)

Study authors also found the inflammation triggers a worsening of the condition, which implies that anti-inflammatory interventions might be the key to saving lives and ending the pandemic.

From the study:

The immune mechanism underlying diffuse alveolar and pulmonary interstitial inflammation in COVID-19 involves a MAS-like state that triggers extensive immunothrombosis…

MAS stands for Macrophage Activation Syndrome, and it is an inflammatory response stemming from an over-reactive immune response, similar to the “cytokine storm” that’s being widely discussed (which vitamin C helps prevent, according to published research). As the study explains:

The severity of systemic inflammation in response to human coronavirus family members has features reminiscent of a cytokine storm or macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), also known as secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis (sHLH).

Figure 1 from the study:

To simplify these findings, covid-19 is not acute viral pneumonia impacting the respiratory system but rather an inflammation-based immunological response that leads to thrombosis (clotting in the lungs) which kills the patient.

The use of ventilators only makes the problem worse, which is why previous observational studies have found that 88% of patients put on ventilators end up dying. They are dying because the ventilator treatment is the wrong treatment.

Chlorine dioxide is reportedly saving 100 percent of the patients studied so far because chlorine dioxide floods the blood with instantly usable oxygen while killing the pathogens responsible for clotting.

There is also anecdotal evidence that some people are beating covid-19 infections with high doses of aspirin, a blood thinner, although this information should not be taken as advice for treatment, and far more research is needed on blood thinners and anti-inflammatory interventions.

This may also help explain why turmeric and vitamin D are associated with strong reductions in inflammation in the body, which may prove useful in balancing the immune response and preventing the kind of imbalance that can lead to immune system overreactions.

The criminal medical cartels are censoring all treatments and cures that work to save lives

Notably, the criminal Big Pharma cartels and corrupt government regulators (like the FDA, FTC, CDC) are going out of their way to try to criminalize or suppress any non-vaccine, non-pharma solutions that might save lives.

Over the last month, we’ve all witnessed an astonishing level of aggression and mafia-style tactics used by the FDA and FTC against pioneering researchers offering a variety of possible solutions, such as chlorine dioxide or intravenous vitamin C.

They’ve even declared war on hydroxychloroquine and the medical establishment has been engineering clinical trials which are designed to fail from the start in order to discredit the off-patent, affordable drug.

There is no doubt that Big Pharma’s obedient government lackeys are at war with truth and are desperately trying to suppress information about natural cures and integrative treatments that might eliminate covid-19 before vaccines can be made available.

The techno-fascist tech giants like Facebook, Google, Vimeo, YouTube and Twitter are all-in with Big Pharma, going out of their way to censor and destroy all information that criticizes vaccines or offers wisdom about natural treatments or integrative medicine interventions.

This criminal cabal of Big Tech and Big Pharma is the enemy of humanity, as they are deliberately working to worsen the pandemic, increase suffering and death and extend the punishing lockdowns for as long as possible in order to cause several economic damage while preparing the masses for mandatory vaccines.

We are all witnessing a powerful criminal gang of corporations and regulators who are deliberately seeking to destroy human society as we know it today, and they are the gatekeepers of information on the ‘net (and in the news).

[The internet was perfectly fine before the powers that shouldn’t be decided to destroy it. Now censorship and propaganda are rampant online, and Google and YouTube searches are no longer relevant since they promote the dinosaur media lies rather than delivering the actual search trends, as they used to. The MSM is shoved down our throats even deeper, while independent researchers are delisted, etc.]

This is why we are repeating our call for the CEOs of all the top tech giants to be arrested and charged with crimes against humanity, then prosecuted in a court of law.

Also read: Amazon, Google And Facebook Have Taken Over The World And Are Now A Threat To Our Very Existence

Over the weekend, a member of Italy’s Parliament gave a rousing speech in which she labeled Bill Gates a “vaccine criminal” and demanded he be arrested and charged with crimes against humanity.

Such efforts should not be limited to Bill Gates, however. They must include the criminals of other tech giants as well as the corrupt, anti-human criminals running the FDA, FTC and CDC, among others.

Their crimes against humanity must not go unanswered, and they must be held accountable in a court of law.

The destructive, anti-human agendas of Big Pharma and Big Tech are incompatible with human freedom and a sustainable human civilization.

These anti-human institutions must be permanently dismantled, and humanity must rise up against this threat in the same way we once awakened against the Third Reich and the rise of Nazi fascism and the Holocaust.

Right now, Big Pharma, Big Tech, the FDA and the CDC are plotting to kill billions of human beings with an engineered bioweapon, a risky vaccine, and high-fatality prescription drugs that make people more vulnerable to covid-19.

These enemies of humanity must be stopped, and the truth about chlorine dioxide must be set free so that human beings can be saved from suffering and death.

To learn more about the establishment’s war on truth (and war on humanity), watch my recent interview with Dr. Judy Mikovits, who has also been subjected to extreme censorship for raising the alarm about how vaccines are spreading infectious disease.

1495,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/05/19/trump-coronavirus-rally-open-up-lock-down-hydroxychloroquine-266476,2020-05-19,Opinion | Give Trump All the Rallies He Wants,"Given the early findings on coronavirus contagion—it spreads most readily when people are in close quarters in enclosed spaces and engaged in full-throated singing or yelling—how likely is it that even a Republican governor would do Trump a favor and approve one of his traditional rallies in his state?

Not very. Could it be that the Democratic conspiracy to shut down the rallies has co-opted the Republicans, too? Or is it just a matter of Eric Trump being full of political beans? Occam’s razor would suggest the latter and that the younger Trump’s mouth simply got out in front of his brain and lapped it a couple of times.

But maybe Eric Trump is onto something. Maybe he isn’t pitching the rally idea just as a pretext to poke his opponent in the eye. If he’s sincere about thinking the rallies should go on, maybe the president shouldn’t wait for an invitation. Maybe he should just browbeat one Republican governor into okaying a big rally and have him throw open an arena’s doors. He might want to approach Florida’s Ron DeSantis, a Republican governor who is giving some gyms and restaurants permission to open at half-capacity and has invited major sports leagues to resume play in his state. The Republican governors of Texas and Georgia, Greg Abbott and Brian Kemp, might give him a thumbs up for a rally if their efforts to restart their states is any indication of their mindsets.

Think of the potential for Trump, who has chafed under the strictures of his White House press briefings. It’d be like a mini vacation from the Covid-19 grind. No one would be nagging him with “nasty” questions about whether he was going to wear a mask on stage. No one would be wearing one. They’d probably be burning masks in the parking lot! And none of that distancing either. Let the show run for a couple of hours, make sure there’s lots of spittle-laden call-and-response between the president and his supporters; high-fives; low-fives; hand-crusher handshakes and not a bottle of sanitizer within sight.

Good for Trump’s mood and some invaluable scientific value to boot. If no one gets sick, all the MAGA-world conspiracy theories will be proven true. But if and when the Covid-19 cases arrive (and I’m betting they surely would), the contract tracers could collect data for a study that shows exactly how safe a big assembly like a rally, a sporting event, or a concert really is. The main cost would be the potential deaths of dozens or maybe hundreds of Donald Trump supporters, but it’s a risk Eric Trump seems willing to take. Come to think of it, the president might want to think twice about trying this in Michigan, where his margin of victory was just over 10,000 votes; how many supporters can he afford to lose?

In another Pirro show passage, Eric Trump called “the media” a partner in the Democrats’ strategy to use the lockdown to wound the president. The media, he said, “is effectively a propaganda arm for the Democrats.”

While it’s true that the liberal commentariat has backed the lockdown, it’s a reach to claim reporters are getting their assignments from DNC headquarters. Even so, some of the Trump faithful have long adhered to the idea that the press works for the Democrats. In the past, the president’s supporters have physically attacked journalists, most notably from the BBC, the Orlando Sentinel, and OC Weekly. Earlier this month, Trump supporters harassed reporters for wearing masks as they covered the president’s visit to the Honeywell plant in Arizona. “You’re on the wrong side of patriotism—you’re like communists,” one supporter said. On May 14, a local TV reporter got heckled while covering a right-wing group’s Long Island rally calling for the reopening of businesses. Trump himself encouraged the harassment when he retweeted the reporter’s video account and added this commentary: “People can’t get enough of this. Great people!”

On Monday, the president announced that he is taking doses of hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug that he has touted as a treatment and a prophylaxis for the coronavirus. “Good things are being said about it,” Trump said, despite multiple reports that it has limited to no effect and might even be harmful in combination with other drugs. As a way to strengthen the bond between himself and his supporters, Trump could pass out complimentary pills to the audience at his rallies. What could go wrong?

CBS Los Angeles reports the cool display at Manhattan Beach has drawn large numbers of visitors over the past several weeks.

The police response is also in anticipation of this being the first full weekend that Los Angeles County beaches will be open since the coronavirus pandemic forced them to close.

All L.A. County beaches reopened Wednesday after having been closed for several weeks. Although the beaches themselves are open for active use, the Strand, the Manhattan Beach Pier and beach parking lots remain closed.

Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights, police will hike patrols around downtown Manhattan Beach, El Porto, and the Strand in order to dissuade gatherings. They will also direct traffic along the busy Ocean Drive.

Research in the UK are offering about $4500 in exchange for two weeks in a secure London facility that has a TV, Playstation gaming, WiFi, and a private bathroom to those who volunteer to be infected.

24 human volunteers are being sought after to infect with coronavirus strains 229E and OC43, while they are similar to COVID-19 they only cause a mild respiratory illness. Once infected a research team will be collecting samples such as nasal and blood, and all dirty tissues will be collected by a trained medical staff to assess the viral load.

Those who volunteer to be human test subjects will be closely monitored 24/7 for symptoms, the researchers will control your diet, and you will be barred from exercising as well as having contact with the outside world along with being confined to your room for two weeks. Along with feeling pretty miserable you will probably be able to get a good gaming or movie binge going, but that’s about it.

This study is part of the mega bucks race to find a cure or vaccine for the current outbreak of COVID-19 which is continuing to spread infection and accumulate a death toll. The company that owns the lab is called Hvivo and they also run clinical trials to find cures for cold and flu offering about $100/day for volunteers with similar perks.

Change the economy.,"Presidential reelection campaigns are generally referendums on the incumbent. A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump’s measures of success. But after a manic 3½ years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.

By far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. “I’m not going to play that game,” said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. “I think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they’re not uniform across states and across countries.”

But even beyond the death count, there’s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. “I’m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,” the official said.

Some Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn’t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn’t been able to focus on getting the response right.

Trump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. “So it is a war and I define victory when it’s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,” he said on May 1. “It can never be a total victory because too many people have died.”

When American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn’t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush’s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.

Others are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. “Allowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,” argued one Republican close to the president.

“The closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.” Sen. Lindsey Graham

But, he added, “If things don’t look like they’re bouncing back by September, I think that’s going to be a problem.”

The fear that Trump can’t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.

When asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump’s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the “economic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.”

A spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.

Others are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)",real

The course was designed in just two weeks by Dr. Susan Wilcox of Massachusetts General Hospital and Mr. Thomas Piraino of the American Association of Respiratory Care in collaboration with Harvard University, edX, and Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt's philanthropic initiative Schmidt Futures.

Dr. Susan Wilcox of Massachusetts General Hospital and Mr. Thomas Piraino of the American Association of Respiratory Care in collaboration with Harvard University, edX, and Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt's philanthropic initiative Schmidt Futures. ""Mechanical Ventilation for COVID-19"" also features a discussion forum where healthcare workers can find support and discuss crucial observations, treatments, and even start regional threads.

Online learning platform edX today announced a new, completely free course on ventilator operation for non-ICU medical professionals being reassigned to ICU units to combat COVID-19.

On top of dangerous shortages of personal protective equipment, ventilators, space, and personnel, hospitals also have a critical need for proper training. ""Mechanical Ventilation for COVID-19"" is designed for non-ICU workers who will be joining the front lines in ICUs and other critical care facilities. It was designed by Dr. Susan Wilcox and Mr. Thomas Piraino of the American Association of Respiratory Care in tandem with Harvard and edX, and funded through a grant from Schmidt Futures, a philanthropic initiative co-founded by Wendy and Eric Schmidt, Google's Executive Chairman.

The entire course can be completed in two to five hours, and it's free to access. All you'll need to do is click ""enroll"".

What the course covers

The course covers the principles and physiology of invasive mechanical ventilation. Among other things, students will learn how to troubleshoot the ventilator, the specifics of ventilating patients in special circumstances like Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome and Obstructive Lung Disease, and how standard ventilation practices are different for COVID-19 patients.

""There are reasons to opt for early intubation for COVID-19 patients (reduces the risk of aerosolization of the virus), so we are focusing on that."" Harvard University explained in a statement. ""[The course] is more about patient monitoring and treatment options that non-specialists may not be familiar with than the mechanics of operating a machine.""

The minds behind the course

Its architects, Dr. Wilcox and Mr. Piraino, are immersed in the fight against the new coronavirus. Dr. Wilcox is Division Chief of Critical Care at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and is leading the team addressing a remarkable influx of COVID-19 patients. Mr. Piraino is the Clinical Specialist for Mechanical Ventilation for the Centre of Excellence in Mechanical Ventilation at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto. ""Mechanical Ventilation for COVID-19"" was borne out of a desire to help their own teams, as well as the thousands of other healthcare workers around the globe who find themselves in exactly the same spot, especially as some cities may be nearing an apex.

A succinct, zero-fee online course is an efficient means for disseminating critical and universally useful information to as many healthcare professionals as possible, regardless of location. And that's why Dr. Wilcox and Mr. Piraino pulled the class together in just two weeks — on top of hours of emotionally and physically grueling hospital work.

""These are my heroes,"" MIT professor and edX founder and CEO Anant Agarwal told Business Insider. ""Actual heroes.""

The course could have a global impact

On top of its immediate usage, edX hopes ""Mechanical Ventilation for COVID-19"" may prove useful longterm. It has edX's standard feature of a discussion forum, in which healthcare professionals can find meaningful support amongst peers as well as a space to discuss treatments, observations, and even create trends of discussion that may be localized down to country-specific issues. The forum will be moderated by HarvardX and a medical expert who can ""pin"" the most useful questions and answers to the top of the forum for easy reference to good information.

Most edX courses are offered in English, but Agarwal told Business Insider that the company would attempt to make transcripts of ""Mechanical Ventilation for COVID-19"" available in multiple languages now that the company isn't moving at warp speed to get the course out as soon as possible.

""This effort is one of many examples of the type of community collaboration that will be required to combat the spread of COVID-19,"" Mr. Piraino said in edX's April 6 press release. ""As the entire global medical community works together to combat this pandemic, I'm proud to work with Dr. Wilcox to create a course that's universally helpful to all medical professionals in this situation.""

Last week, analysts at SVB Leerink interviewed three experts in infectious disease immunology, epidemiology, and public health about ""back to normal"" strategies in the US.

The conversation reveals how many questions remain unanswered about the novel coronavirus and how it can be stopped — from basic, disease-specific concerns like symptoms and transmission, to testing complications and herd immunity, according to a summary the analysts, led by Geoffrey Porges, sent investors.

In the US, COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, has killed nearly 80,000 people and is leading to strange complications in children that scientists still don't understand. Meanwhile, even in the fourth month of US outbreaks, confusion persists about how new testing methodologies and treatments will be deployed.

The experts, who were not identified by SVB Leerink, were particularly worried about rural and urban disparities in testing the effects as stay-at-home orders are lifted, according to the summary.

One expert is ""deeply worried"" that the US will return back to where it started, as the positive test rate is still high in several areas that plan to loosen restrictions, according to the summary.

The experts ""are concerned that once the social distance measures are relaxed there will be a surging number of infected cases,"" the Leerink analysts wrote.

New York is looking to partially reopen starting May 15, based on a set of criteria used to evaluate outbreaks at the local level. Similarly, California released reopening guidelines last week for counties and businesses.

Meanwhile, testing and tracing capabilities as a whole ""still seem shorthanded,"" particularly in rural areas, according to the experts. As reported by The Atlantic last week, the US needs to double or triple its daily testing, but the federal government has no plans to support that increase.

The experts also believe further research is required to address a number of questions about COVID-19's manifestation, duration of immunity, and the role of children in its transmission.

Here are 5 key takeaways from the report.

The role of children in transmission is still unknown

It's still not clear whether children play a major role in coronavirus transmission, according to the experts. For other respiratory diseases like the flu, children are known to be ""major drivers for community transmission,"" the report said.

But in those cases, children tend to develop severe symptoms compared to their adult counterparts, which isn't true for COVID-19. Meanwhile, such a small group of symptomatic coronavirus cases in children makes them difficult to study, the experts told SVB Leerink.

Contact tracing is a method by which public health officials work with a sick patient to find everyone they've come into contact with. One expert told Leerink that the logic is straightforward, but the logistics are not.

For 100 coronavirus cases per day, for example, and 10-15 contacts for each case, up to 300 tracing workers with 40-hour work weeks are needed, according to the summary. States like New York, Maryland, and Massachusetts are all planning to hire or hiring contact tracers, they said.

Still a long way to national testing

Testing underpins all other health and economic measures meant to combat the virus, the experts told SVB Leerink. Today, it's not coordinated at a national level, leading to ""significant variability"" among different geographic regions, according to the report.

Until testing infrastructure is ""formalized,"" country-wide reopening will be problematic, they said.

Current coronavirus tests aren't always accurate

The US Food and Drug Administration has taken steps to get faulty antibody tests off the market, but their accuracy is still wide-ranging. One expert pointed out that tests relying on pinpricks tend to perform worse than those relying on blood draws analyzed in laboratories.

Mitigation efforts alone will not end the pandemic

While social distancing helps, and more people could potentially gain immunity, the only thing that will truly stop the virus in its tracks is a vaccine, according to the experts.

""We will ultimately need vaccination (or a large number of infection cases) in combination with social distancing to contain spread and allow some return to our usual activities,"" the summary said.",real

The move is part of an attempt to reduce operating expenses by $100 million the year, and the company plans to reduce non-headcount related operating expenses to $250 million in 2021. GoPro added that its founder and CEO, Nicholas Woodman, will not be paid a salary for the remainder of the year, and that the company will shift more towards a direct-to-consumer sales model going forward.

The restructuring comes as GoPro has started to recover after its ill-fated move into the drone market. Released in late 2016 after several delays, the GoPro Karma was a basic drone that failed to impress, and GoPro ended up quitting the drone business just over a year later. Last year, there were signs the company had shaken off the pain of the move off the back of the success of the Hero 7.

GoPro says it sold 700,000 cameras in the first quarter and expects its 2020 product and service roadmap to be unaffected by operational cuts, according to Bloomberg.

1087,https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/05/15/kristof-americas-true-covid-19-death-toll-already-exceeds-100000/,2020-05-15,"Kristof: America’s true COVID-19 death toll already exceeds 100,000","Many supporters of President Donald Trump believe that the figures for coronavirus fatalities are inflated, and Trump himself shared a tweet doubting the accuracy of some virus figures.

He’s right that the death toll seems off — but not in the direction he would suggest. We’ve crunched the numbers, state by state, and it appears that somewhere around 100,000 to 110,000 Americans have already died as a result of the pandemic, rather than the 83,000 whose deaths have been attributed to the disease, COVID-19.

That’s my estimate reached with the help of a Harvard statistician, Rafael Irizarry, based on a comparison of death rates this spring with those in previous years. Some states have been largely unaffected — death rates in some even appear to have dropped, perhaps because of less driving and fewer car accidents — but others have seen huge surges in deaths.

Overall, in a bit more than two months, the United States lost more Americans to the coronavirus than died over seven decades in the Korean, Vietnam, Persian Gulf, Afghanistan and Iraq Wars.

Here’s how we reached our estimates; they are not definitive, for they are based on preliminary data, and I invite discussion.

The starting point is that the cause of death is often uncertain. Most people who die don’t get an autopsy, and many never had a coronavirus test. The precise number who died from COVID-19 is in some sense unknowable.

Still, one standard approach to measure the impact of a pandemic like this is to look at “excess deaths,” meaning mortality greater than the average for a particular time period.

For example, for the seven weeks ending April 25 in the United States, about 70,000 more Americans died than is normal for those weeks (death is seasonal and normally declines over the course of spring and summer). That 70,000 figure for excess deaths does not include Connecticut, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, which were excluded because of missing or dubious data.

The official number of COVID-19 deaths in that period for the rest of the country was 49,100. That suggests an undercount of more than 20,000 coronavirus-related deaths as of April 25.

Add those 20,000 missed deaths to today’s total of 83,000, and you already get more than 100,000 pandemic-related deaths. But the undercount probably continued after April 25, albeit at a lower rate.

We don’t have good enough mortality data to assess excess deaths in late April and early May, a period in which more than 30,000 Americans are reported to have died of COVID-19. Testing increased significantly, and over time, doctors seemed more willing to list COVID-19 as the cause of death.

“There’s probably less underreporting as time goes on,” notes Robert N. Anderson, the chief of mortality statistics at the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics. In New York City, a study likewise found enormous underreporting in the first half of April, then gradually diminishing by the beginning of May.

In the period we looked at, the undercount also diminished. Initially, there were more than twice as many excess deaths as reported coronavirus deaths, but by April 25 there were only 40% more. If the undercount thereafter were 10%, that would add a few thousand to the total, possibly bringing it closer to 110,000.

These numbers are uncertain, but the implication is that somewhere around 25,000 more Americans died as a result of the pandemic than are recorded in the death tallies.

This kind of analysis can’t determine if they died directly from the virus or indirectly. Some presumably perished from heart attacks or strokes because they feared going to hospitals and delayed calling 911, or because ambulance services were stretched thin. In other words, a modest number presumably died because of the virus without being infected by it.

One reason to think that a great majority of the excess deaths are directly caused by the virus is that in some states that seem to have meticulous reporting, such as Massachusetts, the number of excess deaths and the number of COVID-19 deaths are not so far apart.

Irizarry, who is also chairman of the department of data science at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, notes that our new estimates are built on several layers of uncertainty. It typically takes two months for deaths to be reported in a reasonably complete way, so one critical issue is how to adjust for lags in reporting. The CDC tries to estimate what the death total will eventually be based on incomplete reporting, and our estimates depend on its algorithms.

The mortality figures show enormous variation by state. Texas and California appear to have suffered more deaths from the 2018 flu epidemic than from the coronavirus so far. And according to the CDC numbers, some states, including Arkansas, Hawaii, Iowa, Kansas, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota and Rhode Island, actually experienced fewer deaths than normal in the seven weeks ending April 25. The reason might be a decline in driving and a drop in accidental deaths.

Irizarry calculates that about 70% of excess deaths nationally derive from just five states: New York, New Jersey, Michigan, Massachusetts and Illinois.

The idea that official figures are undercounts is widely acknowledged. Dr. Anthony S. Fauci told a Senate health committee Tuesday that he didn’t know if the real death toll was 50% higher than the official figures, but that “almost certainly it’s higher.”

“Most frontline doctors will tell you that the numbers are grossly underreported,” said Michael P. Jones, an emergency medicine physician who works at hospitals in the Bronx that were particularly hard hit. Especially in the early days, he said, many COVID-19 deaths were simply listed as some variant of “respiratory failure” or “multisystem organ failure.”

Dr. Alicia Skarimbas, who practices in New Jersey, said, “We signed so many death certificates, we would get behind and take turns doing them.”

Skarimbas said that she would list COVID-19 as the cause of death when that seemed obvious, but her partners might simply list “respiratory failure” unless there had been a positive test for the virus. Thus it was often random whether COVID-19 was listed as the cause of death.

The undercounting is a global problem, not just one in the United States. Dr. Christopher Murray of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington estimates that globally, excess deaths are about double the official COVID-19 death counts.

Excess deaths are often used to gauge mortality from an event or an epidemic. When Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico in 2017, the official death toll stood for a year at 64. But Irizarry and other scholars used a variety of techniques to calculate that excess deaths in the aftermath exceeded 1,000, perhaps by a wide margin. As a result of the statistical work, the official death toll is now 2,975.

COVID-19 will inevitably continue to kill people in the weeks ahead. Those who die over the next week or two have already been infected, perhaps several weeks ago. Dr. Tom Frieden, a former director of the CDC, notes that even if one could end all new infections, thousands would still die from infections already contracted.

Given the uncertainty and the lags in data, why go through this exercise of estimating deaths? Because flawed numbers based on an undercount are already a central part of the discussion, informing policy decisions, and Trump has made them so.

“We have saved thousands and thousands of lives,” he said on May 1. “Hopefully, we are going to come in below that 100,000 lives lost.” In that context, it seems worthwhile to note that this milestone has already been exceeded.

The US National Aeronautics and Space Administration is seeking volunteers who will spend eight months locked up in a lab located in Russia's capital Moscow as part of NASA’s study on social isolation. Participants will live in small groups and the isolation may last up to a year. The project is a collaborative effort between NASA and the Institute for Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

According to NASA's statement, the simulation ""will help NASA learn about the physiological and psychological effects of isolation and confinement on humans in preparation for Artemis exploration missions to the Moon and future long-duration missions to Mars"".

NASA said that all participants will be paid for the experiment. However, not everyone interested can be part of the study. Candidates should be US citizens of 30-55 years of age and speak both Russian and English fluently. They must hold an M.S., PhD, or M.D. or have completed military officer training. Nonetheless, the agency clarified that US citizens with a bachelor’s degree and relevant education and experience may also be considered.

The participants will be challenged with environmental aspects that are similar to those expected on future space missions. Living in a small crew, they will conduct scientific research with the help of virtual reality and artificial intelligence.

""Results from ground-based missions like this help NASA prepare for the real-life challenges of space exploration and provide important scientific data to solve some of these problems and to develop countermeasures”, NASA said in a statement.

Despite most people being tired of confinement within their homes during the coronavirus pandemic, social media users expressed keen interest in the project.

One might think that more than 84,000 U.S. deaths from the disease would have put life in perspective for adults involved in a kid’s game. One might think that money wouldn’t matter so much now to a bunch of millionaires and billionaires.

If one thinks that, one might be a complete idiot.

Baseball players are complaining about owners trying to pull a fast one on them with revenue splits as they negotiate to start the season, probably because the owners usually are trying to pull a fast one. And the owners surely are wondering why the players’ union is being a pain in the butt under such trying circumstances for the nation. Answer: The players’ union is always a pain in the butt.

With the country craving sports, the two sides are arguing over who gets what if and when the season starts in July, a plan the owners recently approved. The players are worried that the owners are using the pandemic to introduce a salary cap to the game, a non-starter for the union. The arguing might eventually give way to peace and an agreement, but it’s almost beside the point. While the virus was bringing the world to its knees, these rich knuckleheads were fighting over dollars.

I don’t believe Tampa Bay pitcher Blake Snell speaks for all baseball players, but his outlook is so outrageously self-centered that it’s a nice starting point for our discussion of sports and money, which are conjoined at the decimal point. Snell said in a recent video interview that he would not play for a reduced salary this season. He said he’s worried about his health, given the COVID-19 outbreak. He should be.

But for him to tie it to money is so … so … baseball.

“Y’all gotta understand, man, for me to go, for me to take a pay cut is not happening, because the risk is through the roof,’’ said Snell, who was scheduled to make $7 million this season. “It’s a shorter season, less pay. I gotta get my money. I’m not playing unless I get mine, OK? And that’s just the way it is for me.

”Like, I’m sorry you guys think differently, but the risk is way the hell higher and the amount of money I’m making is way lower. Why would I think about doing that? Like, you know, I’m just, I’m sorry.”

You want to talk about a bad look? You could have two noses and three eyes and still look better than this guy. Lest you believe Snell is a lone wolf, Phillies star Bryce Harper said: “Somebody’s gotta say it. At least he manned up and said it. Good for him.’’

Here are words to live by: If you’re looking for greed, big-time sports will never let you down. There’s something comforting about that. It’s nice to know that, in a constantly changing blur of a world, there’s something you can count on. You can also count on death.

I’m ashamed to admit that part of me thought there was no way in the world the two sides would get bogged down in money. Surely, I thought, everyone involved would realize how bad financial wrangling would look in this climate. What’s the word everyone uses now? Optics. Right. Arguing over money would be terrible optics.

Forgive me my naiveté.

There are still plenty of concerns over how baseball can return safely in this scary new world. Is it realistic to think that teams can hold the virus at bay while teammates are around each other daily and competing against other players? Is it possible to keep a clubhouse free of germs? Isn’t that like trying to tell a 3-year-old to stay out of the mud? What happens when someone tests positive for COVID-19? Nationals pitcher Sean Doolittle was correct when he pointed out recently that the players union and Major League Baseball officials had skipped right past health and safety issues in favor of conversation about logistics. Read: money.

They can’t help themselves. They just can’t.

But they need to know there could be a price to pay if they allow their haggling to become protracted. They would be wise to remember how angry fans were after the 1994-95 strike and how that anger led to empty seats for several years.

Baseball fans want baseball back. That’s the prize. But they’d like it to be safe for everyone involved. And they’d like it without the greed that pervades professional sports.

Based on the start of Pritzker’s order, that would take the date to Saturday, April 18. Even then, a host of factors could push things back, including the degree to which people can be tested and how full hospitals get.

The experts with whom I spoke are Dr. Bala Hota, an epidemiologist who is vice president and chief analytics officer at Rush University Medical Center; Dr. Elaine Morrato, founding dean of the Parkinson School of Health Sciences and Public Health at Loyola University Chicago, and Dr. Robert Murphy, director of the Institute for Global Health and Center for Global Communicable Diseases at Northwestern Medicine.

While they can’t predict for certain when the outbreak will be under control in Illinois, they do agree on this: Lifting the stay-at-home order should not happen on an arbitrary date such as Easter (April 12), as President Donald Trump has suggested.

COVID-19 symptoms typically do not become apparent until 5 to 7 days after exposure, Hota said. Severe cases on average require hospitalization after an additional 5 to 7 days. Seriously ill patients may remain contagious for longer still.

Criteria for Pritzker lifting the order should include statewide availability of on-demand COVID-19 testing, the experts agreed. There should also be — at minimum — a decline in the rate of increase in daily new cases. Murphy said the number of daily new cases should show a steady downward trend before stay-at-home restrictions are eased.

Another important consideration is how close hospitals are to capacity, Hota said. If the health care system becomes so overloaded that patients do not receive adequate care, more deaths will result from all causes, not just COVID-19.

On-demand COVID-19 testing would require the ability to test at least 4,000 people per day statewide, Murphy said. That’s comparable to the number of tests given per capita in South Korea during the peak of its successful effort to tame the outbreak. The South Korean approach is considered the gold standard for COVID-19 control.

The other experts agreed 4,000 tests per day was a reasonable target.

Pritzker said that, as of March 24, Illinois had the ability to test 2,000 people per day, but expected to be able to test 4,300 per day within two weeks.

As of Saturday evening, Illinois had recorded 3,491 COVID-19 cases, the eighth highest total for any state, including 465 new cases. On average, the number of daily new cases is doubling every three days, Illinois Department of Public Health figures indicate. New cases have been rising sharply since March 9.

In South Korea, new cases rose sharply starting on Feb. 19 and began declining on March 8 — 19 days later, according to data from Worldometer, an international statistics website.

South Korea was able to control the COVID-19 outbreak in a relatively short time because it had ample infrastructure in place due to experience with mini-epidemics such as the 2003 SARS outbreak, Murphy said. South Korea tested up to 20,000 people per day at the height of the coronavirus crisis there.

It also instituted rigorous “contact tracing,” identifying and testing everyone whom infected people had come in contact with through a combination of detective work and technology.

Some public health experts and technologists in the U.S. and other countries advocate the use of smartphone applications and other advanced tools to aid in contact tracing.

South Korea uses a special text messaging service that must be installed on all smartphones sold in that country. If someone tests positive for COVID-19, their path through the community is traced based on information provided by the patient plus credit card transaction location data and security camera video obtained with the patient’s permission.

South Korean authorities have the authority to obtain a patient’s smartphone location data but don’t invoke this unless the patient refuses to cooperate, Ryan Shin, a South Korean who lives and works in Seoul, said in an email. Shin, who graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with an engineering degree in 2012, is CEO of a Korean tech startup.

The service then broadcasts a “safety guidance message” to the phones of all who live in the patient’s neighborhood. The alert overrides other activity on the phone and displays the message accompanied by an audible alarm.

Recipients click on a link to access a page listing the patient’s activities. Shin provided a typical page, shown in the accompanying illustration.

“It says on March 21 she landed at Incheon Airport at 4:30 p.m., took a bus, and rode the elevator in a certain building with a mask on,” Shin said. “On March 22 she went to the hospital for a virus test and then went to the supermarket.”

South Koreans who become ill can use a different smartphone app or visit a website to report their symptoms to a central office, Shin said. The senders receive instructions based on the severity of their symptoms.

Smartphone apps have been developed in other countries to perform similar functions. For example, an app introduced in Singapore uses Bluetooth technology to detect other people’s phones nearby. If a phone owner tests positive for COVID-19, authorities can use the data recorded on the phone to contact others with whom the patient has crossed paths.

The Chicago experts had varying opinions about whether such technology would gain acceptance in this country.

“I never heard of anybody doing it in the U.S.,” Murphy said. “There are a lot of privacy issues. I can’t imagine it happening here.”

“It’s worth exploring,” Morrato said. “It seems like a natural extension of things going on in the private sector that could be redeployed for surveillance. But we need evidence it will make a difference in saving lives as we consider the ethical implications.”

What should happen after the Illinois stay-at-home order is lifted is a matter of debate.

Once COVID-19 is under control in Illinois, it likely will still be raging elsewhere and could easily be reintroduced by visitors. This has occurred in some Asian countries that relaxed restrictions, the experts noted.

Regardless, the U.S. needs to rethink how it deals with pandemics. COVID-19 won’t be the last, the experts agreed.

“It’s not a question of if but when,” Morrato said.",real

We need to make it easier for businesses to reopen as quickly as possible when the pandemic abates.

We also need to incentivize manufacturers to bring their operations back to the US, especially our pharmaceutical supply chain.

Marsha Blackburn is the first woman to represent Tennessee in the United States Senate.

This is an opinion column. The thoughts expressed are those of the author.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

The first quarter results tell the story of an economy under fire. Indeed, American businesses are struggling with an important decision: do we crack the window and reopen our economy? Or, continue to err on the side of caution?

States like Tennessee are leading the way by easing restrictions on local commerce, but business owners remain mired in a fog of what ifs: what if my customers are too scared to leave their homes? What if my employees are too scared to come back to work? What if this financial hole is too deep for me to escape?

Compounding these fears is the knowledge that the existing regulatory state, by its very nature, acts as a barrier to recovery and innovation. For businesses that survive the pandemic, efforts to restart operations will be met with layers of red tape, tax liability, paperwork, and the threat of opportunistic litigation.

When I ask what federal regulations make their jobs harder, with little benefit to be had, business owners can almost always provide a list. Fortunately, the American economy does not exist at the mercy of statutes, even as it functions in spite of them. Congress can and must act now to eliminate unnecessary and burdensome regulatory schemes.

Since March 5, the Senate has passed four ""rescue"" packages of legislation to alleviate the effects of the healthcare and economic crisis caused by COVID-19. However, those packages were missing permanent statutory reform that owners of businesses large and small would welcome.

Moving forward, we should focus on getting government out of the way, and unburdening business owners, reducing the potential for waste, fraud, and abuse, and promoting private investment and competition. This progress, coupled with sensible liability protections, will allow business owners, hospitals, doctors, and nurses to confidently continue serving their communities, without fear of costly lawsuits.

Shoring up America's economy will also require incentivizing business back to our shores. As we create the environment necessary for manufacturing to return to the United States, we must acknowledge that overregulation is one of the reasons it left.

American workers are facing unprecedented levels of unemployment, but if we invest now in education and training programs, we can recoup outsourced manufacturing and jobs. The bipartisan Advanced Manufacturing Jobs in America Act will jumpstart partnerships between colleges and advanced manufacturers to prepare a new, US-based workforce to take over these roles.

We must also look to specific industries to lead the way, under the guidance of targeted legislation. The global pandemic has highlighted vulnerabilities in our pharmaceutical supply chain, caused by our dependence on foreign manufacturers of active pharmaceutical ingredients. My bipartisan Securing America's Medicine Cabinet, or, ""SAM-C,"" Act will expand upon existing programs within the Food and Drug Administration to prioritize issues related to national security and critical drug shortages.

SAM-C authorizes $100 million to develop centers of excellence where universities and the private sector will work together to develop new drug manufacturing technology and processes, and train a new workforce. Proposed tax credits for manufacturers who close foreign-based facilities and open or expand domestic ones will sweeten the deal.

The American people are stronger than this pandemic, and they want their leaders to translate that strength into action.

We know the formula for a successful, productive economy. It's time Congress recognized what American businesses are telling us: if we are able to function safely and efficiently under waived regulations during the COVID-19 crisis, we can do so once quarantine is finally lifted.

The ventilators will be used to help treat COVID-19 patients and could help bolster the national supply of the medical devices, which have been in need during the pandemic.

“There was a lot of concern about the shortage of ventilators and we realized we had expertise already around the supply chain,” Park said to CNBC.

Fitbit plans to submit the designs for the ventilator to the FDA under an emergency use authorization

Fitbit plans to submit the designs for its ventilator to the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use authorization “in the coming days,” according to CNBC. An emergency use authorization is exactly what it sounds like: it allows a medical device or product that hasn’t been officially approved by the FDA to be used to treat a life-threatening disease.

Park aims for the ventilators to be the “most advanced” emergency user ventilator available for a “lower” cost, but that a price hasn’t been determined, according to CNBC. Most ventilators cost thousands of dollars, and high-end ones can cost as much at $50,000. A Fitbit spokesperson declined to give more details to The Verge.

A number of organizations have contributed manufacturing resources to make ventilators. GM and Ford have offered manufacturing space to some ventilator companies to help them produce more units. NASA developed a ventilator designed specifically for COVID-19 patients; the ventilator received emergency use authorization on April 30th, meaning it can enter production. Phone accessory maker Belkin has developed a single-use emergency ventilator in partnership with the University of Illinois which is under review for an emergency use authorization.

The trade association for the world's airlines said that demand for air travel had dropped more than 90% in Europe and the U.S. since the start of the pandemic, and warned that recovery will be even slower if lockdowns and travel restrictions are extended. ""We are asking governments to have a phased approach to restart the industry and to fly again,"" Alexandre de Juniac, the IATA's director general and CEO, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Thursday. De Juniac is hopeful that some flying will resume by the summer. ""We are aiming at reopening and boosting the domestic market by end of the second quarter, and opening the regional or continental markets — such as Europe, North America or Asia-Pacific — by the third quarter, and intercontinental in the fall,"" he said. ""So for summer we hope that you will see flights within Europe coming back, with I hope interesting prices and very safe processes of control."" The European Union's external borders remain closed to non-EU nationals until mid-June. The European Commission has recommended a phased approach for its member states to reopen borders that would start with countries with low levels of coronavirus infections.

The comments from the IATA com as travel groups are desperate to bring operations back to life and some are already rolling out plans to do so. United Airlines has expressed its aims to schedule Europe and China routes in June, Dubai's flagship Emirates Airline will recommence nine outbound routes starting May 21 and European low-cost carrier Ryanair expects to have 40% of its flights running by July 1. Budget carrier Wizz Air will restart routes from London's Luton Airport starting June 16, Lufthansa is planning service expansion in June and IAG will resume some flights in July, among others.

Mandatory quarantine 'useless'

But any hopes for a boost to the industry with some resumed travel will be dashed if governments institute mandatory 14-day quarantine periods for travelers upon arrival, de Juniac warned. ""We are advocating with governments not to implement quarantine measures that will retain people for two weeks that will arrive anywhere,"" he said. ""We think that it is useless provided we have implemented the health and sanitary controls that we are discussing with governments. It is absolutely key for the tourist industry which is so important for so many countries in Europe."" Scores of countries including Australia, New Zealand, China, Spain and potentially the U.K. are requiring international travelers to quarantine for two weeks upon arrival, with varying degrees of enforcement: in Australia, arrivals are escorted to a hotel where they must remain for 14 days, while in other countries they are expected to ""self-quarantine"" at home. Hong Kong issued state-monitored tracking bracelets that arrivals must wear to ensure they do not leave their area of quarantine. Such policies will no doubt deter many people from wanting to travel. De Juniac believes quarantine periods are simply not necessary as long as airlines and airports uphold stringent sanitation and monitoring practices. ""Is it possible to have an aircraft full and without risk of contamination? Our answer is yes,"" de Juniac said, ""provided we implement control and sanitary processes for passengers just before the flight — by asking for temperature control, by the obligation to wear a mask, by cleaning the aircraft properly and disinfecting properly, by limiting the distribution of food to prepackaged food, by limiting cabin luggage to one luggage to avoid disembarking and embarking process to be too overcrowded."" With such a multilayered approach, he argued, ""you limit the risk of contamination. ... And then the quarantine is not useful from our point of view in this case.""

These new measures are in addition to the company’s existing misinformation policy, which Instagram has been actively enforcing alongside parent company Facebook over the course of the virus’s worldwide spread over the last two months.

Part of this new effort includes a new feature Instagram is calling Co-Watching, which will let you browse posts with your friends over in-app video chat. The feature can be accessed by starting a video chat through the Instagram Direct messaging tab and tapping the photo icon in the bottom left of the video chat screen. It lets you look at saved, liked, and recommended posts together as a group.

The new misinformation measures include a new educational alert at the top of search results for connecting users with World Health Organization (WHO) resources; stickers promoting accurate and verifiable information from health authorities (like a “Stay Home” sticker to promote social distancing); more aggressive removal and moderation of coronavirus-related content from the Explore tab; and downranking of content in both the Instagram feed and in Stories that doesn’t meet the bar of third-party fact-checkers.

“If posts are rated false by third-party-fact checkers, we remove them from Explore and hashtag pages,” an Instagram spokesperson said in a statement to The Verge. “We also remove false claims or conspiracy theories that have been flagged by leading global health organizations and local health authorities as having the potential to cause harm to people who believe them.”

Prior to this new set of policies, Instagram has already begun taking action against coronavirus-related misinformation in the form of banning misleading ads for products claiming to offer cures or prevent people from contracting COVID-19 as well as temporary bans on ads and branded content promoting medical supplies like face masks and hand sanitizer. Earlier this month, Instagram removed the ability the search for COVID-19-themed augmented reality effects unless they were created in partnership with a “recognized health organization,” such as the WHO.",real

In a May 4 interview with CNN, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi shot back with her own assessment of Illinois’ financial straits.

“Look at him saying these states want to be bailed out,” Pelosi told host Wolf Blitzer. “The state that he used as an example was Illinois, which got into fiscal problems because of a Republican governor who was governor there until Gov. Pritzker has come to pull it out.”

The National Governors Association sent a bipartisan letter to Congress in April that made clear the financial pressure caused by COVID-19 is being felt by states nationwide, not just in blue states as Trump has said.

But what about Pelosi’s assessment of how Illinois got itself into a financial bind?

Her comment suggests Illinois’ hardships are a matter of recent history, dating back just a few years to the time of Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s Republican predecessor. State finance experts say that’s misleading.

Rauner’s role

Understanding what Pelosi was referencing requires a brief detour into recent state history.

In November 2014, Illinoisans elected Republican Bruce Rauner as governor. Rauner, a private equity investor and political newcomer, reached an impasse with Democrats who control the Legislature over how to run the state. That left Illinois without a spending plan for two years.

With government spending left operating largely on autopilot, social services suffered, public universities laid off thousands of employees and the state’s pile of unpaid bills tripled, causing credit rating agencies to reduce Illinois’ rating to near-junk status.

As the state’s chief executive, Rauner played a starring role in the showdown that caused the budget crisis. But he had plenty of co-stars among the state’s leading Democrats, including longtime House Speaker Michael Madigan, who has exerted influence over every state budget for the past four decades.

Democratic leadership also allowed a temporary state income tax increase to expire days before Rauner was sworn into office in 2015, leaving the state with even less cash to make ends meet during the crisis. Rauner had urged the Legislature to let it lapse before taking office, and Madigan along with then Senate President John Cullerton obliged despite warnings from then Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn, who lost to Rauner in 2014.

A legacy of fiscal mismanagement

Foisting all the blame for the state’s unprecedented budget crisis on Rauner isn’t the only problem with Pelosi’s narrative. That’s because the tale of how Illinois dug itself into a fiscal hole dates back much further than his single term in office.

When we raised this with Pelosi’s office, a spokesman responded with an email saying she was “clearly referencing the fact that Illinois’ situation greatly worsened” under Rauner — not that he alone was responsible for the state’s fiscal woes.

But experts interpreted her statement differently.

“To claim that this is a problem created by Gov. Rauner is clearly misleading,” said David Merriman, an economist who heads the Fiscal Futures Project at the University of Illinois’ Institute of Government & Public Affairs. “It’s a problem that’s developed over decades.”

Illinois governors and lawmakers from both parties have long managed to increase government spending without raising the revenue needed to support it.

“For many, many years we’ve provided more goods and services … than our revenues would support,” said Charles N. Wheeler III, who has studied decades of state budgets as both a journalist and professor at the University of Illinois Springfield. “It’s always easier for lawmakers to fund programs than it is to raise the revenues to cover it.”

Indeed, the alarm bells began sounding long before Rauner took office. A 2011 report from the state comptroller’s office warned of a looming financial crisis created by many years of rampant spending. The report cautioned that the recession at the time had exacerbated the state’s ongoing failures to reduce its debt, build up its emergency reserves, or contribute enough to state employee pension funds.

And when it comes to pensions, Illinois’ problems date back even further. In 1917, a report commissioned by the General Assembly was already warning the funds were “moving toward crisis” due to inadequate payments from the state.

“We’ve been shortchanging the pensions for more than a hundred years,” Wheeler said.

Our ruling

Pelosi said Illinois “got into fiscal problems because of a Republican governor who was governor there” before Pritzker.

Illinois’ financial situation did worsen during Rauner’s term while the state operated without a spending plan for an unprecedented two years, but he wasn’t solely to blame. What’s more, the state was already teetering on the brink when he took office because of decisions made by leaders from both parties dating back decades.

How those supplies are used is crucial, experts say.Based on current evidence, SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is most frequently transmitted between people via droplets when an infected person breathes out, coughs or sneezes, and can also spread via contaminated surfaces such as door handles.
For the general public, basic preventive measures include keeping a safe distance of 1 to 2 metres, washing hands with soap for 20 seconds or using a hand sanitiser, wearing a face mask if crowded situations cannot be avoided and not touching one's eyes, nose, and mouth.
In hospitals and other frontline medical scenarios, however, the guidelines are much more complex - and the personal protective equipment (PPE) much more robust.

Opinion contributor

Immunity for corporations when they fail to take basic safety precautions against COVID-19 will cause more American workers and consumers to die and further hamper our economic recovery.

Blanket legal immunity will prolong the pandemic, with some businesses inevitably forgoing basic precautions. Workers and consumers will not return to offices, stores and restaurants if companies cannot be held accountable when they fail to prioritize health and safety. If no one is responsible, no one is safe. People will not go back to their normal routines if they don’t feel safe.

A recent poll found that nearly two-thirds of voters across party lines oppose legislation giving guaranteed immunity to businesses, and even small business owners think it’s unnecessary. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce — which has been demanding legal immunity for decades — inadvertently revealed in its own polling that “liability protection” was the lowest priority of small business owners.

As the president of an association representing thousands of trial lawyers, I know that there won’t be a flood of lawsuits, and the Chamber of Commerce knows this, too. Proving that a company acted unreasonably and that those exact actions caused harm will be difficult. It will be extremely challenging to prove that a victim was exposed and got sick in one specific place given the number of places or people from which or from whom that victim could have been exposed.

The cases that move forward will be the ones like those involving nursing homes that kept sick workers on the job resulting in mass death, or food processing plants that offered bonuses to sick employees who came to work.

OUR VIEW:Coronavirus lawsuits immunity requires public health guidelines

National Consumers League:Immunizing all companies would hurt both workers, consumers

Even then, blanket immunity won’t help those sick workers or the families of those who died — it will just shield corporations that failed to take reasonable steps.

Let’s make the health of workers and consumers the top priority and then watch our businesses and economy flourish. We’re all in this together.

Women’s Aid Federation of England (Women’s Aid), which provides direct services to domestic abuse victims and engages in research and policy campaigning, has given an interview to Sputnik, outlining how the situation with domestic abuse has changed amid the pandemic. The organisation, however, underscored that the “true impact” of the lockdown may not be known until it is lifted and more abuse victims are in a position to reach out for help.

Sputnik: There have been reports of substantial increases in domestic violence in places that have implemented COVID-19 lockdowns, including in Wuhan, China, and Paris, France. Has the UK seen an increase in domestic abuse/violence since the lockdown was declared, and if so, by how much?

Women's Aid: 10 women and two children were killed by men in the first two weeks of the lockdown (between 23rd March and 6th April). This is three times higher than the average of three women killed every two weeks.

Additionally, data is not yet available to show the true impact of Covid-19 on survivors. Firstly, because it is a crime that takes place behind closed doors. Secondly, many women experiencing domestic abuse may only be able to reach out for help when lockdown measures lift.

Survivors are telling Women's Aid that abuse is escalating during Covid-19; our Survivor Survey found that 67% of survivors who are currently experiencing abuse told us that it had got worse since Covid-19. We are deeply concerned about the increased physical and emotional harm women and children experiencing domestic abuse may be facing during this period.

Sputnik: Can you explain exactly why the lockdown might exacerbate domestic abuse or violence?

Women's Aid: It is important to be clear that Covid-19 is not a cause of domestic abuse - only abusers are responsible for their horrific actions. The pandemic is clearly, however, escalating abuse, and closing down women's escape routes to safety, such as friends and family or the specialist support of domestic abuse services.

It's vital that women know that support continues to be available for them during this challenging period and that they will be listened to and helped. It is also important survivors know that domestic abuse is a crime and if you are in danger, always call 999.

Sputnik: Is there any difference between the nature of support you are providing to people during the lockdown to that which you would provide during 'normal' times?

Women's Aid: Support services are working around the clock to adapt to these unprecedented times. Refuges are supporting as many women as they can whilst facing new challenges such as staff sickness and the spread of the virus within shared accommodation. However, less than half (48.5%) of refuge service providers were able to comply with government guidance to stay open for existing service users and new referrals. Most anticipate an increase once measures are lifted, 66.7% stated they were concerned about future increases in demand.

Our direct services, which provide specialist support from domestic abuse support workers to survivors, have continued during this period and, as below, Live Chat has expanded to meet the increasing demand.

Within the first two weeks of lockdown, there was a 41% increase in users visiting Women's Aid's Live Chat site and we have doubled the Live Chat hours available to survivors during the Covid-19 lockdown. From Monday 20th April, the service has been open to survivors from 10am – 2pm Monday to Friday to provide a secure way for women to reach out and get specialist advice and support. Many women feel safer using online instant messaging with Live Chat than a phone call that may be overheard.

The Women's Aid Rail to Refuge scheme means that survivors with a refuge space can travel for free across England, Scotland and Wales. When lockdown started, the Rail Delivery Group were quick to respond to women's needs and launched a temporary, nationwide scheme.

Sputnik: What are the kinds of things that can be done to support victims of domestic abuse during this time period?

Women's Aid: For family or friends who are concerned about someone who may be experiencing domestic abuse, this lockdown period is difficult, as it means opportunities for face to face support and conversation are not available. And for survivors, it means that many routes to support outside the home are closed down [please see here for detailed advice].

Advice includes trying to keep a mobile phone on you and charged at all times and, if possible, keeping safely in touch with people you trust online or by phone – perhaps having a regular safe time they can check in with you.

And the key message is as mentioned above: please call 999 if you feel you are in immediate danger.

Sputnik: Is there a concern that people who may leave their homes seeking respite from an abusive household (as opposed to exercise) but are unable or unwilling to discuss the matter may be inadvertently targeted by the police for being outside without a 'reasonable excuse'? Are you aware of any such cases happening?

Women's Aid: ""Escaping risk of harm"" - including removing yourself from an argument - is an accepted and valid reason for leaving your home. The government and police forces have made clear that, if you are not safe at home, you are allowed to leave. And it's vital that this message continues to be clearly communicated.

Please note that leaving an abusive partner is statistically a dangerous time for a survivor and that survivors should access specialist support to help them leave safely.

Sputnik: In your opinion, are there sufficient resources being offered to organisations such as yours to deal with domestic abuse?

Women's Aid: Specialist domestic abuse services provided by Women's Aid members across the country are facing huge challenges in delivering life-saving work. After years of funding crisis, they are now experiencing a perfect storm of staff shortages, increased costs from remote working, lost fundraising income and challenges in accepting new referrals into refuges because of the risks of the virus spreading.

Together with other violence against women and girls (VAWG) organisations, we have been urging the government to deliver one simple, emergency fund for this life-saving sector.

The government's funding announcements are therefore very welcome. But we are concerned that it will not be enough to sustain the sector during this crisis, and we urge this to be kept under review as the impacts of the pandemic become clearer.

Funding must also be ring-fenced for specialist VAWG services led by and for BME women, deaf / disabled women, and LGBT survivors. These services are essential for fulfilling duties under the Equality Act and Public Sector Equality Duty, as well as meeting survivors' specific support needs, but they have been marginalised and excluded from existing funding systems.

Their inclusion, through a specific ring-fence, is essential for an equitable funding system which does not further entrench inequality and social injustice, which has been exacerbated in this pandemic.

Updated March 19 at 9:25 a.m. ET

The coronavirus pandemic is forcing the U.S. Census Bureau to temporarily suspend all field operations for the 2020 census for two weeks until April 1, the agency announced Wednesday in a statement on its website.

As the country continues to bunker down in response to the spread of COVID-19, the bureau's director, Steven Dillingham, says it is making the change ""to help protect the health and safety of the American public, Census Bureau employees, and everyone going through the hiring process for temporary census taker positions.""

For the next couple of weeks, the bureau is also reducing the number of on-site workers at two facilities in Jeffersonville, Ind., that process paper census forms, the bureau says in a separate statement on its website.

Another facility in Phoenix that also processes paper forms is ""adopting social distancing practices in line with guidance from health authorities,"" Michael Cook, a spokesperson for the bureau, told NPR in a statement on Thursday.

Many census advocates are worried that the ongoing public health crisis could jeopardize the bureau's ability to accurately count the U.S. population this year as required by the Constitution.

All U.S. households, however, can continue to respond to the census on their own either online at my2020census.gov, over the phone or by paper form, if they receive one. Official letters with instructions on how to participate in the national head count are expected to arrive at most homes by Friday.

The announcement comes days after the bureau confirmed to NPR on Saturday that it is delaying deploying door knockers to college towns until April 23 and waiting until early April to start sending out census workers with computer tablets to help people complete online forms.

Still, there has been a lot of uncertainty about how the bureau plans to protect early rounds of census workers expected to go door to door to count residents in remote parts of Alaska and Maine, and in some American Indian tribal territories. Other workers were set to leave paper questionnaires in Puerto Rico and other places recovering from natural disasters. The bureau had also been preparing to conduct an in-person count of people experiencing homelessness.

Recently hired enumerators, also known as door knockers, and other field staff have been gathering around the country for training sessions. The bureau confirmed to NPR on Saturday that at least one employee, who was hired to be a census field supervisor, has tested positive for COVID-19 and is in quarantine.

""The employee is following guidance of the Iowa Department of Public Health,"" Michael Cook, a spokesperson for the bureau, said in a follow-up email on Sunday.

While that employee has not interacted with the public on behalf of the bureau, the census field supervisor was in contact with a ""very limited number of employees"" at a training session, and all of them are in self-quarantine, Cook said on Saturday.

The latest state population counts are due to the president by December 31, according to federal law.

The numbers of every person living in the U.S. determine each state's share of congressional seats and Electoral College votes for the next decade. They also guide how as much as $1.5 trillion a year in federal funding for Medicare, Medicaid and other public services are divided up among local communities.

In the written statement, Dillingham said that as of Wednesday morning, more than 11 million households have submitted a census response on their own through the Internet since March 9, when the online form at my2020census.gov was soft launched.

Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.), who helps oversee the 2020 census as the chair of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, says she hopes more households will continue to find ways to respond to the census during the temporary pause in field operations.

""Every American should know that this does not affect your ability to self-respond,"" Maloney said in a statement. ""By responding now, you will ensure that the Census Bureau does not need to send a census worker to your door.""",real

Along the cement stars of Hollywood Boulevard, where vendors are normally packed arm to arm hawking maps to the stars, Michael Jackson gloves and the chance to pose with the likes of Johnny Depp, only a single vendor selling masks sat near Ida Lupino’s star hoping for a sale, while the marquee at the El Capitan theater flashed words of encouragement from the likes of “Toy Story” hero Buzz Lightyear such as, “The important thing is that we stick together.”

Further down the street a “Star Wars” stormtrooper looking like he just came off of a movie set skateboarded down Hollywood Boulevard — in the center lane, with no traffic in sight.

Under normal circumstances, there would be no room to skateboard on the sidewalks or the streets anywhere near Hollywood Boulevard, which would be flooded with tour buses and bumper to bumper traffic.

During his press conference, Gov. Newsom said, “At some point in the future, we will need to modify our stay-at-home order. … As we contemplate reopening parts of our state, we must be guided by science and data, and we must understand that things will look different than before.”

A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump’s measures of success. But after a manic 3½ years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.

By far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. “I’m not going to play that game,” said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. “I think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they’re not uniform across states and across countries.”

But even beyond the death count, there’s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. “I’m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,” the official said.

Some Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn’t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn’t been able to focus on getting the response right.

Trump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. “So it is a war and I define victory when it’s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,” he said on May 1. “It can never be a total victory because too many people have died.”

When American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn’t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush’s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.

Others are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. “Allowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,” argued one Republican close to the president.

“The closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.” Sen. Lindsey Graham

But, he added, “If things don’t look like they’re bouncing back by September, I think that’s going to be a problem.”

The fear that Trump can’t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.

When asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump’s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the “economic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.”

A spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.

Illinois House Majority Leader Greg Harris, D-Chicago, and state Sen. Elgie Sims, D-Chicago, chairs of the Joint Commission on Ethics and Lobbying Reform, said Tuesday that the pandemic has forced them to miss a deadline in their efforts.

The commission was required to release a report by Tuesday with recommendations on how to end entrenched corruption in Illinois, but as the COVID-19 crisis has temporarily shut down sessions of the General Assembly, it has also stymied the work of the commission.

“We have completed our meetings, heard from stakeholders and are working through the proposals that have been put before us,” the two Chicago Democrats said in a joint statement. “However, due to the ongoing crisis, more time will be necessary to complete our work.”

The commission, established by the Legislature in November, is tasked with proposing ways to reform state government in the wake of scandals that have rocked state, county and municipal government. Harris and Sims said they still hope to pass ethics reform legislation in the spring legislative session, which is scheduled to adjourn May 31. But since lawmakers have not met since March 5 – and Gov. J.B. Pritzker on Tuesday extended the state’s stay-at-home order until April 30 — that could become increasingly difficult.

Before the pandemic altered the landscape, Pritzker declared that ending corruption was a priority. In his State of the State speech in January, the governor said the state must “root out the purveyors of greed and corruption — in both parties — whose presence infects the bloodstream of government.”

A wide-ranging federal investigation targeting state lawmakers and other politicians prompted the latest push.

In September, federal officials raided the offices of state Sen. Martin Sandoval. The Southwest Side Democrat pleaded guilty to corruption charges in January.

In October, state Rep. Luis Arroyo was charged with bribery. The former Northwest Side Democratic legislator’s case is still ongoing. Earlier last year, state Sen. Tom Cullerton, D-Villa Park, was indicted in August for allegedly embezzling money from the Teamsters.

While Republican lawmakers wanted to tackle corruption in the fall veto session last November, Democrats opted to form the commission to study the issue first and to release a report on what reforms are needed.",real

Iran’s semi-official Fars News agency said on Sunday that President Hassan Rouhani and his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan had discussed the borders reopening in a phone calls held earlier in the day.

Rouhani and Erdogan urged “immediate reopening of land and air borders” while observing hygiene protocols to allow trade between the countries to resume, said the report.

Border closures that began after the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus pandemic, have caused trade between Iran and Turkey to decline significantly in the first quarter this year.

A report by Tehran’s Chamber of Commerce published earlier this month showed that the value of the three-month trade between the neighbors had decreased by 70 percent to stand at $645 million at the end of March.

In his phone call, Rouhani told Erdogan that resumption of economic exchanges between Iran and Turkey was a necessity given the current economic around the world as a result of the pandemic.

Erdogan also vowed to issue orders to expedite the reopening of Turkey’s eastern borders with Iran. The Turkish president also reiterated the need for more cooperation between Iran and Turkey on how to handle the spread COVID-19.

Iran has been the worst affected country in the Western Asia region by the COVID-19 pandemic. Figures published by Iranian health ministry on Sunday showed the number of people tested positive for the disease had increased by 2,180 to reach a total of 135,701.

In a 74-page decision, U.S. District Judge Fred Biery wrote that the coronavirus pandemic had left the world “without immunity and fearfully disabled.”

The decision came after the Texas Democratic Party and individual voters filed a suit last month arguing that the state’s denial of mail-in ballots during a pandemic was a violation of their constitutional rights.

Only people over the age of 65 and those with a disability that prevents them from voting in person are allowed to cast mail-in ballots in the state.

Echoing a false claim made by President Donald Trump last month, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, also a Republican, has argued that expanding mail voting would only “serve to facilitate fraud.”

“Mail ballots based on disability are specifically reserved for those who are legitimately ill and cannot vote in person without needing assistance or jeopardizing their health,” Paxton said after a district court ruling last month. “Fear of contracting COVID-19 does not amount to a sickness or physical condition as required by state law.”

But Biery rejected Paxton’s arguments, writing that the state raised the “specter” of widespread voter fraud but offered little evidence that such crimes are happening in states that allow more mail-in voting.

“The court finds the Grim Reaper’s scepter of pandemic of disease and death is far more serious than an unsupported fear of voter fraud,” he wrote.

Any eligible voter who wants to vote by mail to avoid contracting coronavirus can apply for a ballot in upcoming elections, Biery wrote.

Paxton said in a statement Tuesday that Biery’s decision “ignores the evidence and disregards well-established law.” His office plans to seek immediate review by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.

The decision comes amid a political battle over vote-by-mail during the pandemic. Democrats have largely supported expanding access to mail-in voting, with lawmakers urging party leaders to make it a priority. House Democrats included a provision in the latest coronavirus relief bill that would offer every American that option to vote by mail in the 2020 presidential contest.

Trump, who has voted by mail himself, said the bill was “DOA.”

“If you look at the bill that Nancy Pelosi is putting in, it has a lot to do with elections. We're not going to lose elections because of that,"" he said.",real

The hires of sporting director Georg Heitz and coach Raphael Wicky were well-received, and the WGN-TV and Arlo White announcements were applauded. The work of the business staff was set to pay off with a record crowd as the Fire made their return to Soldier Field against Atlanta United, a franchise they hope to emulate

But that has been put on hold by COVID-19, which forced MLS to pause its season and postponed the Fire’s big day. Understandably, chief operating officer John Urban said there was some disappointment within the front-office staff when that news came down, though the overriding reaction has been a sense of resolve and optimism.

“When you ask about morale, the reality is that the success that was there and will be there, we’ll still have that day,” Urban told the Chicago Sun-Times. “It’s just going to come a little later than planned, but for right now we’re focused on the health and wellness of the entire Fire family and our fans and players and partners. We’ll get back to it, but that momentum is something that has stuck with everybody.”

Urban said the Fire were tracking toward 60,000 tickets sold for March 21, which would have been a sellout. Eventually, the Fire business side will welcome fans to Soldier Field for an opener, and they’re already considering the delicate balance of celebrating a big day while keeping the right tone in the wake of the pandemic.

Urban said the Fire want to “be a source of strength in these times.”

“We can be a source of enjoyment or diversion through some of the stories and connections that we have with fans and players and memories,” Urban said. “Not a day goes by that we don’t think about finding that right voice, finding our place in the citywide landscape and dialogue. It’s going to be an important thing. When we do come back, we’ve got to make sure we’re calibrated properly. It’s going to be key.”

That consideration also relates to how the front office is trying to maintain that momentum through what could be a lengthy break in the season. Urban said staying in touch with the fans thoughtfully and sensitively is a goal, and he’s proud of the Fire’s participation in Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s “We Are Not Playing” campaign along with the city’s other major-league professional teams.

The unique situation also gives the Fire staff, which sources say hasn’t been furloughed or seen a pay cut, a chance to work in ways they otherwise wouldn’t.

“We’re working remotely here, every day we’re looking at opportunities, we’re looking at things that we can do to take advantage of some of the time that we now have to plan and to lean into some initiatives, both things that have arisen through the current situation, but also our business and the 2020 season generally,” Urban said. “The word momentum and the level of energy and commitment, we’re still working on it every day.

“If there are things we can do or ideas we can now explore because we have the luxury of a little bit of time, we’re taking advantage of all of that and being aware of the situation around us.”",real

Lobbyists are virtually descending on official Washington to try to gather as much as they can of the government's ongoing coronavirus relief packages.

Companies and interest groups — many of them new to the lobbying world — are competing for loans and other forms of financial help.

The Center for Responsive Politics tracks money spent in U.S. politics. Sheila Krumholz, the organization's executive director, talked with All Things Considered about the boom in lobbying for coronavirus relief. Here is some of that interview:

I'm curious what industries you've noticed are hiring lobbyists for the first time now.

About three-fourths of the new registrations sent for the last month have cited COVID and are by companies that are either new to lobbying or haven't lobbied in recent years. And about a third of those are for health care companies. ...

There are some related to education which aren't so typical, but lots of travel and tourism, gaming and entertainment, and retail and manufacturing, kind of what you would expect to see at this time.

Lobbying is traditionally face-to-face, it's this incremental process. What does that process look like now when everyone's working remotely and when the legislative process is so much more accelerated?

Like the rest of us, the lobbyists on K Street have had to pivot from in-person meetings to phone and video calls and emails. Not ideal when you're trying to sell a policy to Congress that needs quick information. But lobbyists can provide that if their calls are answered. So that's where the revolving door networks are really important. There are short time frames and the lack of in-person contact makes getting your call taken critical.

Have you spotted any examples of industries that are using this pandemic opportunistically, like to get something now that they have fought for in the past but couldn't get before?

Oh, absolutely. The bigger groups with lots of lobbying experience are adept at repackaging their existing agenda. It would be urgent and worthy of relief even when those items have been on the wish list for a long time. So hotels get a tax break they've been pushing for since 2017. Big banks have pushed for deregulation they've long wanted. Tech has pushed for delays in privacy laws and changes for gig workers. So that's being kind of mushed into the package.

In a new study, researchers created a model that uses a trio of biological markers to predict whether a patient was likely to die from COVID-19.

The model was able to forecast the death of individual patients more than 10 days in advance with at least 90% accuracy.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Doctors are struggling to identify which coronavirus patients will develop severe cases that require hospitalization and put them at risk of death.

Newly published research may offer a way to accurately predict a patient's risk of dying from COVID-19. The authors of a study published Thursday in the journal Nature Machine Intelligence created a model that looks at three biological markers — which can be measured in a drop of blood — that can indicate whether a patient's case might get dangerously severe more than 10 days ahead of time, with at least 90% accuracy.

Taken together, these three clues could ""play a crucial role in distinguishing the vast majority of cases that require immediate medical attention,"" the authors wrote, adding that their model ""provides a simple and intuitive clinical test to precisely and quickly quantify the risk of death.""

A trio of indicators that suggest a higher risk of death

In Wuhan, China, research shows 14%-19% of infected patients became severely sick. Among those critically ill cases, the death rate was higher than 60%.

To identify commonalities between these severe cases, the researchers analyzed blood samples taken repeatedly from 485 coronavirus patients at Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China, between January 10 and February 18. They tested for myriad kidney, heart, and blood-clotting issues, noted whether those patients had survived or died, then used machine-learning algorithms to look for biological patterns.

The results found that the following indicators can predict whether a patient had a higher risk of death than other infected people:

High levels of the enzyme lactic dehydrogenase (LDH). This is associated with lung damage and the type of tissue breakdown that happens during pneumonia. Lymphopenia, the term for low levels of lymphocytes — white blood cells that defend the body against invading pathogens. An increase in high-sensitivity C-reactive proteins, or hs-CRP for short. This indicates inflammation in the lungs.

Using those indicators, the computer model could predict what happened to the hospital patients 10 days in advance of their clinical outcomes.

""The three key features, LDH, lymphocytes and hs-CRP, can be easily collected in any hospital,"" the researchers wrote in the study. ""In crowded hospitals, and with shortages of medical resources, this simple model can help to quickly prioritize patients, especially during a pandemic when limited healthcare resources have to be allocated.""

A coronavirus 'risk score'

Another study published this week took a similar approach, pinpointing 10 biomarkers that can help doctors assess individual patients' risk levels. That research, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association on Tuesday, suggested using these markers to determine the likelihood that a hospitalized COVID-19 patient will become critically ill — admitted to an intensive-care unit or put on a ventilator — or die.

The researchers retrospectively examined medical records from 1,590 patients who were treated in 575 hospitals across China between November 21, 2019 and January 31.

Two of those biomarkers overlap with those suggested in the Nature study: high levels of LDH and a high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (which is associated with lower levels of lymphocytes).

The other eight risk predictors include a history of cancer, high number of preexisting medical conditions, older age, shortness of breath, coughing up blood, unconsciousness, abnormal chest X-rays, and high levels of bilirubin (a substance in the blood that, in elevated amounts, indicates liver damage).

The researchers used those 10 indicators to develop an online coronavirus risk ""calculator"" that could help predict which hospitalized COVID-19 patients will become critically ill.

That prediction tool could enable doctors and healthcare workers optimize hospital resources, the study authors wrote.

""If the patient's estimated risk for critical illness is low, the clinician may choose to monitor, whereas high-risk estimates might support aggressive treatment or admission to the ICU,"" they said.",real

Danish club unveil first-ever 'Virtual Grandstand' to allow fans to attend games via Zoom,"After two months without football, Danish Superliga team AGF Aarhus are now offering virtual tickets to their upcoming game against rivals Randers FC, meaning watching fans will appear on giant screens inside the stadium.

As if the world of sport hadn’t got surreal enough in these unusual times what with spectators being replaced by cardboard cut-outs and sex dolls, fans of one team in Denmark are now able to grab free tickets for their games - and cheer them on inside the ground via online chat platform Zoom.

AGF Aarhus of the Danish Superliga have announced they are erecting giant screens inside 22 sections of their Ceres Park stadium, on which the players will be able to see the faces of watching fans cheering them on from the comfort of their own homes.

The fans will also be able to pick sections when choosing tickets for the upcoming game against their local rivals Randers FC on May 28 that will allow them to ‘sit’ alongside their friends in the Superliga’s first game back since lockdown due to the coronavirus. So while they may not be able to actually go to the stadium, they will be able to ‘gather’ as the match begins.

The screens and technology involved will take 23 people to operate and the sections will be monitored to ensure home, away and neutral fans aren’t located on the same virtual screen. Although you would imagine the prospect of any fights breaking out must be fairly low.

AGF’s CEO Jacob Nielsen certainly seems excited about the project, saying: “It will be the first tournament match in a long time. We are celebrating that with a historic digital initiative, and we are proud to be the first club in the world to use it.

""Now it seems that we have to do without spectators for a while, so maybe we can inspire a similar initiative at other clubs that can also benefit from it in the coming time.”",fake

A new study offers a glimmer of hope in the grim fight against the coronavirus: Nearly everyone who has had the disease — regardless of age, sex or severity of illness — makes antibodies to the virus.
The study, posted online on Tuesday but not yet reviewed by experts, also hints that anyone who has recovered from infection may safely return to work — although it is unclear how long their protection might last.
“This is very good news,” said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University in New York who was not involved with the work.
Antibodies are immune molecules produced by the body to fight pathogens. The presence of antibodies in the blood typically confers at least some protection against the invader.
Health officials in several countries, including the United States, have hung their hopes on tests that identify coronavirus antibodies to decide who is immune and can go back to work. People who are immune could replace vulnerable individuals, especially in high-transmission settings like hospitals, building what researchers call “shield immunity” in the population.
But most antibody tests are fraught with false positives — picking up antibody signals where there are none. The new study relied on a test developed by Florian Krammer, a virologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, that has a less than 1 percent chance of producing false-positive results.
Several small studies have given reason to hope that people who have had Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, would gain some immunity for some period of time. The new study is the largest by far, with results from 1,343 people in and around New York City.
The study also eased a niggling worry that only some people — only those who were severely ill, for example — might make antibodies. In fact, the level of antibodies did not differ by age or sex, and even people who had only mild symptoms produced a healthy amount.
Having antibodies is not the same as having immunity to the virus. But in previous research, Dr. Krammer’s team has shown that antibody levels are closely linked with the ability to disarm the virus, the key to immunity.
“It really shows that most people do develop antibodies, and that there’s very good correlation between those antibodies and their capability to neutralize virus,” Dr. Rasmussen said.
Researchers at Mount Sinai tested people who signed up to be donors of convalescent plasma, antibodies extracted from blood. The project has enrolled more than 15,000 people so far, according to Dr. Ania Wajnberg, who is leading the effort.
The new study is an analysis of results of the first set of donors. Over all, only 3 percent of these participants had been seen in the emergency department or had been hospitalized. The remaining subjects had only mild or moderate symptoms.
“To my knowledge, this is the largest group of people described with mild disease,” Dr. Wajnberg said.
The criteria for inclusion became more stringent as the team learned more about the coronavirus. For example, they initially required the potential donors to be free of symptoms for only three days but later extended that to 14 days.
The team tested 624 people who had tested positive for the virus and had recovered. At first, just 511 of them had high antibody levels; 42 had low levels; and 71 had none. When 64 of the subjects with weak or no levels were retested more than a week later, however, all but three had at least some antibodies.
That suggests the timing of testing for antibodies can greatly affect the results, the researchers said. “We weren’t looking exactly at this, but we had enough to say that 14 days is probably a little too early,” Dr. Wajnberg said.
There was even a difference between levels at 20 days versus 24 days, she said, suggesting that the optimal time for an antibody test is well after symptoms begin. “What we’re telling people now is at least three weeks after symptom onset,” Dr. Wajnberg said.
Because tests to diagnose coronavirus infection were unavailable to most people in New York City in March, the researchers included another 719 people in their study who suspected they had Covid-19 based on symptoms and exposure to the virus, but in whom the illness had not been diagnosed.
In this group, the researchers found a different picture altogether. The majority of these people — 62 percent — did not seem to have antibodies.
Some of them may have been tested too soon after their illness for antibodies to be detectable. But many probably mistook influenza, another viral infection or even allergies for Covid-19, Dr. Wajnberg said.
“I think literally everybody in New York thinks they’ve had it,” she said. “People shouldn’t assume the fever they had in January was Covid and they’re immune.”
Other experts were more struck by the percentage of people who turned out to have antibodies, even though the coronavirus had never been diagnosed in them.
The number suggests that “in cities like New York, there are a tremendous number of undiagnosed infections,” said Taia Wang, a viral immunologist at Stanford University.
An antibody survey conducted by New York State officials found that 20 percent of city residents had been infected.
Another finding from the study — that diagnostic PCR tests can be positive up to 28 days after the start of infection — is also important, Dr. Wang said. These tests look for genetic fragments, not antibodies, and suggest an active or waning infection.
“As far as known unknowns about SARS-CoV-2, this one really stands out,” she said. “We really need to know, how long does it take the body to clear the virus? How long are people contagious? We don’t know the answer to that.”
She and other scientists said it was highly unlikely that a positive test so long after symptoms appeared represents infectious virus. Researchers in South Korea recently announced, for example, that several suspected cases of “reinfection” were a result of PCR tests picking up remnants of dead virus.
Genetic material from the measles virus can show up in tests six months after the illness, Dr. Krammer noted. And genetic fragments of Ebola and Zika viruses are known to persist even longer in the body.
Still, Dr. Wang said, “Until we do know, it’s prudent for everyone to proceed as if a positive PCR test means contagious virus.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people isolate for 10 days after the onset of symptoms, but that period may need to be longer.
[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]Experts said the next step would be to confirm that the presence of antibodies in the blood means protection from the coronavirus. The body depends on a subset of antibodies, called neutralizing antibodies, to shield it from the coronavirus.
“The question now becomes to what extent those are neutralizing antibodies and whether that leads to protection from infection — all of which we should presume are yes,” said Sean Whelan, a virologist at Washington University in St. Louis.
In Dr. Krammer’s previous work, to be published in the journal Nature Medicine, his team tested whether the antibodies have neutralizing power. The researchers found that in about a dozen people, including some who had mild symptoms, the level of antibodies in the blood corresponded to the level of neutralizing activity.
So everyone who makes antibodies is likely to have some immunity to the virus, Dr. Krammer said: “I’m fairly confident about this.” Another way to assess immunity would be to show that purified antibodies can prevent coronavirus infection in an animal.
But perhaps the most urgent question, especially as research on vaccines ramps up, is how long that immunity might last.
Even if the levels of antibodies fall over time to undetectable levels, people may still retain some protection from the coronavirus.
Immune cells called T cells are valuable soldiers in fighting pathogens, and at least one study has shown that the coronavirus provokes a strong response from these cells. So-called memory cells, or B cells, may also kick into gear when they encounter the coronavirus, churning out more antibodies.
Ultimately, however, the answer to how long immunity lasts will come only with patience.“Unless someone has come up with some way to speed that process up,” Dr. Rasmussen said, “the only way to tell that is by following these patients over time.”",real

There have been 58,457 total cases of COVID-19 recorded in Cook County, which includes all of Chicago and many of its suburbs, after officials added 2,051 new cases in the last 24 hours. Queens, by comparison, added only 336 cases over the same time frame to bring its total to 58,084.

Cook County still has a lower rate of COVID-19 per capita given its population (5.1 million) is more than twice as large as Queens (2.25 million). But Queens also has a much higher population density with 20,500 people per square mile compared to 5,500 per square mile in Cook County, which can make social distancing measures more challenging to maintain.

Illinois officials announced Thursday that the statewide case total has increased to 87,937 while the death tally closes in on 4,000. Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s administration recently warned that projections show the state could see 50-150 deaths per day into June or later.

In addition to Queens, six other New York counties have been among the top ten nationwide for coronavirus case totals, while the next highest Illinois county — Lake — was No. 49 in the nation as of Wednesday with 5,662 cases.

Facing calls from some local leaders growing impatient with his phased plan to reopen regions of the state, Pritzker said “this virus is still among us.

James Dean starrer “East of Eden” (1955), crime drama “Bonnie and Clyde” (1969) and disaster film “The Towering Inferno” (1974) are among other titles playing, after Japanese chain Toho Cinemas reopened 10 of its 66 theatres in areas deemed relatively safe from the coronavirus.

The unit of Toho Co, which also runs a film studio, said it would reopen 23 more cinemas on Friday in prefectures where the government has lifted the state of emergency.

Cinemas in Tokyo remain shut.

Toho Cinemas, which had closed all of its theatres as of April 18, has implemented safety measures including keeping every other seat empty and making staff and customers wear masks.

Reopening theatres leads to another challenge, however: what films to show after movie studios delayed new releases because of the pandemic?

Toho’s reopened theatres mostly offer a mix of old Hollywood, recent Japanese hits and holdovers like Oscar-winning “Parasite” that were in cinemas before the closures, although that mix varied between theatres, its website showed.

Its Sendai cinema in northern Japan on Tuesday was screening the American classics mentioned as well as neo-noir sci-fi classic “Blade Runner” (1982), prison drama “The Shawshank Redemption” (1994) and several Japanese films including “Shin Godzilla” (2016).

Its Sun Street Hamakita theatre in central Japan’s Shizuoka skewed more towards local films headlined by multiple screenings of Makoto Shinkai’s animation megahit “Your Name” (2016) and his follow-up “Weathering With You” (2019).

But Sun Street Hamakita was also showing Steven Spielberg’s sci-fi classic “E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial” (1982), romantic drama “An Officer and a Gentleman” (1982) and musical “West Side Story” (1961).

Western “Rio Bravo” (1959), starring John Wayne, was also playing in some theatres.

Asked about the selection of films on show, a Toho official simply said: “We’re playing films that are popular.”",real

The risk is that politicians, business owners and ordinary Americans who are making decisions about lockdowns, reopenings and other day-to-day matters could be left with the impression that the virus is under more control than it actually is.

In Virginia, Texas and Vermont, for example, officials said they have been combining the results of viral tests, which show an active infection, with antibody tests, which show a past infection.

Public health experts say that can make for impressive-looking testing totals but does not give a true picture of how the virus is spreading.

In Florida, the data scientist who developed the state’s coronavirus dashboard, Rebekah Jones, said this week that she was fired for refusing to manipulate data “to drum up support for the plan to reopen”.

Global coronavirus cases and deaths (PA Graphics) More

In Georgia, one of the earliest states to ease up on lockdowns and assure the public it was safe to go out again, the Department of Public Health published a graph about May 11 that showed new Covid-19 cases declining over time in the most severely affected counties.

The daily entries, however, were not arranged in chronological order but in descending order.

For example, the May 7 totals came right before April 26, which was followed by May 3. A quick look at the graph made it appear as if the decline was smoother than it really was.

The graph was taken down within about a day.

Georgia state Democrat Jasmine Clark, who has a doctorate in microbiology, said the graph was a “prime example of malfeasance”.

“Sadly it feels like there’s been an attempt to make the data fit the narrative, and that’s not how data works,” she said.

Republican Governor Brian Kemp’s office denied there was any attempt to deceive the public.

Spokeswoman Candice Broce insisted that the governor’s office is not telling the department what to do and that officials are not trying to dress up the data to make Mr Kemp look better, saying that “could not be further from the truth”.

As for the May 11 graph, Ms Broce said public health officials were trying to highlight which days had seen the highest peaks of infections.

“It was not intended to mislead,” Ms Broce said on Tuesday. “It was always intended to be helpful.”

Federal guidelines say that before states begin reopening, they should see a 14-day downward trend in infections.

However, some states have reopened when infections were still climbing or had plateaued.

States have also been instructed to expand testing and contact tracing.

The US has recorded 1.5 million confirmed infections and over 90,000 deaths.

Vermont and Virginia said they stopped combining the two types of tests in the past few days.

Still, health officials in Virginia, where Democratic Governor Ralph Northam has eased up on restrictions, said that combining the numbers caused “no difference in overall trends”.

In Texas, where health officials said last week that they were including some antibody results in their testing totals and case counts, Republican Governor Greg Abbott said on Monday that the numbers were not being commingled.

Health officials did not respond to requests for clarification.

Georgia’s Department of Public Health also regularly publishes a graph that shows cases over time, except new infections are not listed on the day they came back positive, which is the practice in many other states.

Instead, Georgia lists new cases on the day the patient first reported symptoms.

That practice can shift the timeline of the outbreak and make it appear as if the state is moving past the peak.",real

But upon examination, Biden’s proposal has no substance, misses the point, and offers nothing but the same failed liberal policies empirically known to destabilize the black community while avoiding our biggest concerns.

First, Biden’s proposal ignores the role illegal immigration has had on disadvantaged black Americans.

Biden’s proposal boldly claims he will “close racial wealth and income gaps.” But he plans to do that during a presidency that would roll back an immigration-labor framework which prioritizes American workers first, something that has been a boon to black workers.

If there’s one thing the Biden campaign and Democrats at large love to do, it's conflating the black and brown condition in America. Homogenizing issues central to black Americans as a singular approach for “people of color” ignores the ways that lax immigration policies have left certain black populations vulnerable to its consequences. While uncomfortable for the left to admit, it’s consensus knowledge that liberal immigration policies have had an adverse effect on black wealth. As the supply of low-skilled, low-wage labor became available in the U.S. labor market, Black wealth declined.

Approximately 60% adult black men have a high school diploma or less, making them disproportionately employed in low-skilled labor markets, where they are more likely to be in competition with immigrants. You don’t have to be a rocket scientist to understand how illegal immigration over the past forty years has depressed wages for low-skilled American citizens, a disproportionate number of whom are black men.

The policy wonks who work for Joe Biden have to know that there is no addressing black wealth inequality without addressing the ways that illegal immigration has systemically undercut the black community. Considering the platform of the Democratic party, addressing illegal immigration in the ways needed to resolve black wealth inequality is an impossibility. Biden’s proposal not only ignores the problem but intensifies it by aiming to spend billions of federal dollars to create more housing projects in “distressed” communities. Empirically, these projects simply create more flashpoints for violence as these projects end up being dominated by street gangs that have evolved (for worse) as a result of the emergence of Latin gangs and their conflicts with the black community.

Biden’s proposal is called the “Lift Every Voice” plan, but you can’t lift black voices as they’re being drowned out by the needs of illegal immigrants who seem to have supplanted African-Americans as the Democratic Party’s preferred audience to pander to.

Secondly, prosperity for black Americans is contingent on prosperity for all Americans, and Biden’s plan to raise taxes will likely kill prosperity across the board.

The Joe Biden campaign claims black businesses would flourish by reinstating old Obama and Clinton era tax-credit policies while rolling back the reforms President Trump made that saw the country shatter economic records. He pledges to double funding for the State Small Business Credit Initiative which he says helped black businesses under President Obama but even Obama’s fiercest supporters look back at his presidency wondering why these initiatives did nothing tangible for the black economy. The plan makes no mention of how these tax credits helped in the past or would help now, while also neglecting to explain how the credits would function differently from President Trump’s Urban Revitalization plan , which is already in full swing and having an impact on capital mobility. New income, payroll, and capital gains taxes to pay for a litany of government-funded programs and the permanent expansion of the New Markets Tax Credit will simply be another letdown for the black community, as the 15% estimated market reduction of Biden’s tax proposal will likely be a dark shadow on the market, preventing all growth.

Despite the economic downtown caused by the pandemic, Joe Biden has pledged to eliminate tax reform achieved under the Trump presidency, creating an environment that will make it very hard for all businesses to survive, including black-owned ones.

The coronavirus has undoubtedly stolen President Trump’s economic edge as a tool of persuasion to the black community but the Lift Every Voice plan gives the President another opportunity to regain it by exploiting this weakness of Biden’s. There is simply no way the former vice-president is going to be able to justify the success of this plan as opposed to the pro-business environment most black Americans enjoyed before the COVID-19 pandemic. Black unemployment hit its lowest points in years and the White House’s Urban Revitalization program created optimism where there wasn’t.

A recent poll shows that despite President Trump being less popular than Biden head to head, a majority of Americans believe he is better suited to create jobs. The market likely thinks similarly and if it were to rebound, a Biden victory and perceived incoming taxes could tank investor confidence. Given the fact that statistically speaking, black voters have had the most to lose from the COVID downturn, the economy will likely weigh heavily in their decision. The Lift Every Voice plan was supposed to stimulate trust in Biden’s economic plan but clearly it promises much more than it can deliver.

Third, this plan just reeks of, well, Joe Biden.

Perhaps the most glaring problem with Biden’s so-called plan to empower black America is the fact that it’s based on a realm of failed neoliberal policies with the same concept: the government will fix it this time, we promise.

The idea that a Biden White House would mark the end of government corruption while making it more transparent and efficient in the process is a dream we’ve been sold before. If Joe Biden being in the White House is such an advantage for the black community, why wasn’t it so when Biden was there for nearly a decade? The entire tone of Biden’s plan is that the black community will have some financial renaissance moment because ol’ Joe has finally seized the reins of power. But Biden has been at the highest levels in power in Washington for over 40 years.

The more one delves into Biden’s plan to revitalize black America, the more it becomes obvious that this is merely a distraction or ploy to make up for his campaign’s lack of black engagement at a time when the Trump campaign even beat Biden to the punch on turning black engagement virtual.

Even the rollout of the policy questions its sincerity. Not only does the link to the policy initially take you to a landing page to donate to his campaign, but its wording is extravagant and it lacks necessary implementation specifics. Even the name of the policy plays with complicated emotions and history. “Lift Every Voice and Sing” is the name of a song widely viewed as a “Black national anthem” of sorts dating back to its inception during a crucial time for black Americans as they dealt with the turmoil and hatred of Jim Crow replacing slavery. It’s a song endorsed by Booker T. Washington that was used during a time when Democrats wreaked havoc on black Americans with institutional racism.

Given Biden’s friendship with Jim Crow apologist and former senator Strom Thurman and with the wounds of Biden’s controversial 1994 crime law being fresh, you would think Joe Biden might steer away from claiming such a rich part of black history as his own. The so-called Lift Every Voice plan dismally falls short. There may not have been so much of an eye roll from the black establishment media on this proposal, but given their ties to the Democratic National Committee I wouldn’t hold my breath on waiting for criticism. But social amplification online is already speaking volumes.",fake

To understand who would benefit from this new bailout, we took a close look at another recent bailout for farmers: the $28 billion program, administered without congressional oversight over the last two years and meant to offset damages from President Trump's trade war with China. We wanted to know, where did the money go?

As it turns out, most of it bypassed the country's traditional small and medium-sized farms that were battered by the loss of their export market and which are now being hit with severe losses from the coronavirus pandemic.



South Dakota is soybean, corn and wheat country, and right now it's reeling.

A farm in South Dakota

Bob Kuylen: If people are-- are really wanting to jump off a building about what the stock market is doing, we've been doing that for three years now. We did everything right. We raised great crops. But we're still losing our rear ends because, uh, because of what's happening with-- with—the sanctions. And now with the Coronavirus, it's gonna be another hit, without a doubt.



Doug Sombke: So imagine three years ago, you lost 30% of your paycheck and then the next year, you lost another 30%. I mean, that's the pain we're feeling.



Doug Sombke and Bob Kuylen oversee the farmers unions in North and South Dakota with more than 50,000 farmers and livestock producers. The average farm here is less than 1,500 acres.



We interviewed them remotely.



Lesley Stahl: What is happening to your farmers with this virus?



Doug Sombke: It's just accelerating the problem. And we are, um, not being able to sell because everyone's worried if the plants are gonna stay open.



Lesley Stahl: And restaurants closing and…



Doug Sombke: Yeah, yeah. The food is starting to back up. Uh, the freezers are getting full. Restaurants aren't buying. So yeah, it's really becoming a huge issue for us.

With restaurants and schools closed across the country, their markets are shrinking. It's adding to already rising debt and farm bankruptcies aggravated by the trade war with China. They told us the bailout, called the Market Facilitation Program that began in 2018, helped them survive the last two years but didn't come close to covering most of their members' losses or their own.



Lesley Stahl: How did the tariffs, the sanctions affect you?



Bob Kuylen: About $70,000 a year I lost in the last couple of years.



Doug Sombke: On our farm, we've lost-- in the last, uh, three years, roughly $125,000 to $200,000 a year.



Lesley Stahl: But what about the bailouts? You had two rounds. This was supposed to tide you over.



Doug Sombke: Yeah.



Lesley Stahl: Did it?



Doug Sombke: Well, it made the banker happy. It didn't do anything for me.

Bob Kuylen and Doug Sombke

Lesley Stahl: We've seen reports of suicides going up among farmers.



Bob Kuylen: Oh, yeah. I know personally families that are suffering through that. The-- the stresses out there now, it's just-- they're out there for four or five generations of their family and they're the ones that lost the farm? What do you think that's gonna do to their-- their mind?



Doug Sombke: Yeah a lot of depression. And, just this past year in my hometown, we've-- we've lost three young men to suicide. It's-- it's just hard, Lesley, because you see these young guys coming up and, you know, and-- and you've coached them in baseball. You-- you-- you have had hopes that-- you're glad they stayed in the community and then you end up seeing this happen. And, none of their fault. Not any of their fault. And it's hard. And I worry about my kids. My-- my sons are on the farm and I worry about them all the time.

After President Trump imposed the stringent tariffs in 2018, China struck back hard here in the Farm Belt -- imposing its own steep tariffs, especially impacting soybeans, our largest agricultural export to China, and sending commodity prices into a freefall. The administration tapped a Depression-era fund for agriculture and provided $28 billion for farmers, almost $3 billion to purchase surpluses for food banks and other nutrition programs and more than $24 billion in direct aid to farmers.



President Trump: ""We will ensure the farmers get the relief they need. And very, very quickly. It's a good time to be a farmer, we're going to make sure of that.""



But so far, most of the money has gone to the biggest farms - one-third of it to just 4% of them. Even farm owners who personally report nearly $1 million in income per year are eligible.

We spoke to Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue in March, in the early days of the pandemic before social distancing was the norm. He defended the trade war bailout and the payments to farmers that were based on the amount of crops produced in 2018; and by planted acreage in 2019.

Sonny Perdue: It's not a welfare program. It's not a subsidy. It's not a price-support system. It is a market-damage system. A disruption there.



Lesley Stahl: These payments are disproportionately going to the big, wealthy farms at the expense of the smaller farms where the suffering is.



Sonny Perdue: The fact is, Lesley, most of our production in America is done by large farmers. That's just the way it happens. These are-- these are awards based on the production. And-- but we did try. We've got payment limits that cut people off.

Sen. Grassley: I tried to limit farm subsidy recipients

But the payment limits don't always cut people off. The limit, or the cap, designed specifically for the biggest operators, used to be $125,000 per person or legal entity. But that was raised last year to $250,000.



Lesley Stahl: But why did you double the cap? The limit?



Sonny Perdue: We saw the amount of trade damage that was happening here. The need was out there in order to keep these farmers where they could continue. Not be made whole, but to continue to survive to farm again the next year.



Ken Cook: They made changes for the very largest farmers. If you're a small farmer, you don't have to worry about the limits. You're gonna not come close to hitting them. But large farmers, they changed it so that a husband could get $250,000. His wife could get $250,000.



Ken cook is the president of the Environmental Working Group that's been tracking farm subsidies for decades and now the direct payments to farmers under the Trump administration's bailout.



The USDA data Cook obtained through a search of public records show farms are actually collecting millions of dollars – way over the cap. They do it by exploiting permissive eligibility rules that the administration adopted from Congress' farm bills. Those rules allow big farms to collect maximum payments on behalf of not just the farmer, but many others.



Ken Cook: Cousins, uncles, aunts.



Lesley Stahl: So let's say I have a cousin who's a farmer. And I'm a reporter in New York. I sit here. I don't do any farming. But I'm a cousin.



Ken Cook: That's right.



Lesley Stahl: I can get money?



Ken Cook: You can get money. Maybe you have to make a phone call a couple times a year to find out what--



Lesley Stahl: But I don't have to even go there?



Ken Cook: No, you don't have to live on the farm or visit the farm. These payments aren't just going to farmers who are out there climbing up on a tractor every morning. These payments are going to people who are living in the middle of New York City because they happen to have an ownership interest in the farm.

Ken Cook

Many farms today have investors - call them absentee owners - who also collect bailout money. When we checked, we found hundreds of recipients living in big cities including New York City, Miami, San Francisco. Among them, a banker, an architect, a composer, a classical musician.

Not South Dakota's Doug Sombke's idea of a farmer.



Doug Sombke: I mean, my sons are the ones out here working. They're the ones that should get the money. If you've got dirt under your fingernails, you're the ones that should be getting the money, nobody else.



Lesley Stahl: But doesn't the money come to the farm?



Doug Sombke: No, it can go anywhere. They can distribute it as the corporation sees fit, right?



Ken Cook: If you're a very large farm operation and you're eligible for these payments, the most important tool as a farmer is not what's in your machine shed. It's the lawyer you hire to set up a paper farm that's designed to absorb as much federal money, as much Trump payment, as possible.



Lesley Stahl: And there are lawyers who are documenting these family owners?



Ken Cook: There are lawyers who specialize in helping big farms maximize their payments from the Department of Agriculture. It's an industry in and of itself. And they do very well.



Lawyers like Robert Serio who for years have been making the most of the loopholes in farm subsidy policy - and now the Trump administration's bailout.



Lesley Stahl: Do you know the nickname that you have?



Robert Serio: Uh, not really.



Lesley Stahl: It's Loophole. They call you Loophole.



Robert Serio: Somebody else called me the Cap Doctor.



Lesley Stahl: Oh, the Cap Doctor?



Robert Serio: The Cap Doctor.

Robert Serio

Serio is based here in Clarendon, Arkansas, a tiny town with one sit down restaurant where he knows everybody.



He has more than 250 clients in 25 states that he says are all actively engaged in farming. Serio represents the deline farming operations. They include three partnerships that usda data show are registered to the same address in Missouri, which in total collected more than $5 million in the bailout so far – way more than the cap.



Robert Serio: These are not loopholes. They are designed regulations. All I did was follow a trail that the government laid out for me.



Lesley Stahl: Well, no one is saying it's illegal. Nobody.



Robert Serio: No.



Lesley Stahl: If that farm is a partnership, how much can they get if there are 20 people in the partnership? Do they still only get $250,000?



Robert Serio: No, ma'am.



Lesley Stahl: They get $250,000 times 20, right?



Robert Serio: If, if they earn it. If that land that they're farming earns that money.



Lesley Stahl: Let's say it earned the money, but there's only one person. And he, they then get…



Robert Serio: I would say to that one person he needs to come and see me. Because he's not running a very economical farming operation.



Lesley Stahl: So I've come to you. What are you-- what do you do? What do you advise me to do?



Robert Serio: First thing I would do, ask you if you were married. And if your answer is yes, I would say, ""Then you need to form a husband and wife partnership."" That would be my first advice. Secondly, if you're even bigger than that, I might ask you, ""Do you have any children who are working' on the farm?""

And if that answer is yes, then I would tell them how to be able to use that child to enhance that-- the cash flow for that partnership I'm going to form. And your farming operation will be-- have more eligibility and en-- enhance your cash flow, make you more profitable. Everybody'll benefit from that.



Lesley Stahl: What's the largest partnership you ever formed?



Robert Serio: 66 partners.



Lesley Stahl: 66.



Robert Serio: Yeah.



Lesley Stahl: That's a lot.

Sonny Perdue

Remember this is taxpayer money. Secretary Perdue said if farmers are exploiting weak subsidy laws to get money they shouldn't, it's Congress' fault.



Sonny Perdue: What I'm telling you, Lesley, is that we use the same criteria as Congress passed in the farm bill to determine who is eligible to receive money and who is not. That-- that's the facts.



Lesley Stahl: Ok.



Sonny Perdue: We-- we are administrators of the law passed by Congress.



Lesley Stahl: But let me ask you, as the secretary of agriculture, if you think that's a good idea. To have those-- allow those partnerships to exist.



Sonny Perdue: I think, again, it really is the responsibility to Congress to determine this. From my perspective as an administrator, my job is to follow the law.

An ancient woman, whose pleadings will haunt me to my death, sat in a hallway in a wheelchair endlessly shouting, “Help me! Help me!” with her arms outstretched.

I ran to the nursing station nearby, where many people were busily working but ignoring the patient in need. “That woman needs help,” I barked.

A nurse, nurse’s assistant, attendant or someone in a uniform whose rank I could not identify slowly turned their head toward me from the paperwork they were working on at the time.

Columnists In-depth political coverage, sports analysis, entertainment reviews and cultural commentary.

“She does not need help,” this person said very firmly. “That is just what she does.”

I was convinced that this nursing home employee was a wretched person, as were they all. No feeling individual could turn a deaf ear to such cries of anguish. I walked over to the woman myself and said, “Can I help you?”

“Help me,” the tiny woman cried. “Help me!” There was no further explanation.

Years passed. I grew older. Visited many nursing homes. And eventually placed my father in one.

And one day, that tough old man, that World War II veteran, that survivor of the Great Depression, who as far as I know never asked anything from anyone, was sitting in his wheelchair in a hallway shouting, “Help me!”

“What, Dad?” I asked. “What do you need?”

He looked at me with searching eyes and said, “I don’t know.”

I came to the conclusion that he wanted out. Out of his predicament. Not just out of the nursing home, that wretched place where people wait for the end, but out of his body and out of the muddle that perplexed his mind.

It is a terrible place to be. To live or to work. To even think about.

I suppose that is why so many of us refuse to visit long-term care facilities, even before COVID-19 struck, before there was a quarantine.

I would visit my father every day. But I was usually alone. That didn’t make me better than other people. It did make me a little more mentally unstable during that time, I suspect.

It is said that for most states, a third of COVID-19 deaths are in long-term care facilities. In 14 states, more than half of the virus deaths are in such places.

Political leaders must do something to help our elderly, shriek those with grandmothers, grandfathers, aunts and uncles, mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, in such places.

And political leaders themselves shout that something must be done.

Yet, we know what these places are. We always have.

They are underfunded. Inspections are haphazard. They are often money factories. They are far too often warehouses, storage facilities, for those waiting to die.

That is not to say we don’t love the people inside. In fact, often we love them too much to see them waste away. It is terrifying to watch such a thing.

And so we leave underpaid, overworked and too often uncaring people to deal with the dirty work. We don’t want to look.

What happens when we don’t look is the same thing that always happens when people turn away. Abuse. Neglect. Incompetence.

There are sometimes angels at work in these places. I have seen them with my own eyes. They care. They pay a personal price I cannot imagine.

But when I hear howls of righteous indignation on this issue from the public and their representatives, I am reminded of the false outrage that erupts following a mass shooting by people who are mentally ill.

We are all standing on the “Help me!” floor listening to the anguished cries. I sometimes wonder if that’s my own pathetic voice I hear joining the chorus.

Editor, Health Impact News

Earlier this month (April, 2020) we reported about the shortages of meats at supermarkets, and how this reflected not a shortage of meat in the U.S., but the failures of our supply chains when a nationwide crisis hits, such as the Coronavirus scare has done.

We discussed how allowing local communities to directly access meat from farmers and ranchers in their own counties and states was the solution to food security issues in our nation’s meat supplies.

See:

The publication Civil Eats has done an excellent job of reporting on these kinds of problems that are systemic within our nation’s food supply chains.

In another excellent investigative report on flour shortages that many are starting to see around the country, Amy Halloran has written an excellent article titled:

Again, as we saw with the meat market, there is currently no shortage of flour in our nation. The issue is the frail supply chain.

Some excerpts from Halloran’s excellent article:

There is no flour shortage in America. Outside the taut supply chains of industrialized food, small flour mills are working double-time to fill fresh flour orders for dedicated fans and a new crowd of bakers. And while these local millers have been around for generations, it took a pandemic to reveal them as alternatives to the dominant grain system. Today, having a relationship with nearby grain farmers seems like a more secure route to bread than it was just a month ago. Industrial milling and factory baking set the standards for what gets grown, and the global marketplace sets the price. Farmers are servants to massive debts they’ve had to take on to purchase equipment, and each year they borrow more money just to pay for inputs, labor, and other expenses. Outside of this industrial baking complex, there exists a world of farmer-cultivated grain systems that not only address the limited choices farmers face inside the conventional system, but also produce delicious, fresh flour, which is generally stoneground and full of the fat and flavor that industrial processing strips away. And it is as different from its supermarket cousin as a tree-ripened peach is from a can of cling peaches. People who are just awakening to the promise of regional grains will be surprised to see just how many exist, how well-rooted they are—and how they’re ready to supply you with grains that will change your life. There are many community grains, produced, processed, and distributed within local and regional value chains that remain intact despite the pandemic. By adapting food systems to a regional scale, farmer-leaders…. are taking risks to better support and care for the land they steward from the ground to the bank. They’re giving consumers an opportunity to buy staple crops that invest in soil health, water quality, and carbon sequestration while offering skilled jobs that employ local folks—on the farm, at the mill, and in craft bakeries. Read the full article here.

When Restaurants Become Grocery Stores

In yet another excellent article published by Civil Eats, Jodi Helmer wrote a report titled:

In our article about Wyoming’s Food Freedom Act and the nation’s meat supply issues, we mentioned how the closing of restaurants and other venues that serve food, such as sporting and entertainment events, was what was putting a strain on the meat market supplies.

With the entire nation confined to their homes and unable to visit restaurants and other venues where food is served, this in turn created a huge demand for more food at grocery stores, while bulk food distributors were left with an excess of inventory that was not packaged properly for retail sales.

Helmer’s article documents how some restaurants have dealt with this situation while solving two problems at once: providing more business for their restaurant so they could stay in business, and providing much needed items to their consumers that they could not find in their local grocery stores, such as eggs, flour, and toilet paper.

Some excerpts from Helmer’s excellent article:

A few short weeks ago, Sarah Heard was cooking dishes like charred duroc pork, veal sweetbreads, and butternut risotto and serving them in the Austin, Texas, restaurant Foreign & Domestic. Now, the dining room is closed, and instead of serving nose-to-tail suppers, chef/owner Heard is filling bags with groceries. In the last two weeks, she has stocked (and sold out of) staples such as eggs, salt, and lemons; customers purchased 100 pounds of flour in a single afternoon. The coronavirus pandemic has led Foreign & Domestic to evolve from a full-service restaurant into a grocery store. “We knew that people were having trouble finding things at the stores,” Heard recalls. “We thought it could help the neighborhood—and it’s possibly the only reason we’re staying afloat.” The pandemic dealt a significant blow to restaurants. The latest data from the U.S. Department of Labor shows that the U.S. lost a total of 701,000 jobs in March; restaurants and bars accounted for 60 percent of those losses. The devastation had forced restaurants to get creative to keep their doors open. In addition to offering takeout and deliveries, steakhouses are being reinvented as butcher shops, upscale eateries are hosting virtual cocktail classes, and chefs are creating DIY meal kits. Turning dining rooms into supermarkets is also proving popular. Read the full article here.

How Do We Change the Nation’s Food Supply Chains?

Food security is a serious issue in this country, and the Coronavirus scare should be a wake-up call for everyone. As far as the food shortages in our grocery stores, this might get worse before it gets better.

And remember, this is all simply the result of people staying home. Imagine how much worse this could be if there were disruptions to our energy sector, and our truckers who transport all this food all across the nation could not get diesel fuel to power their trucks?

Or a disruption to our electrical grid where all of stored refrigerated and frozen foods would quickly spoil? Or even worse scenarios where communication systems went down, such as cell phones and the Internet, and without the ability to communicate to the public things would quickly spin out of control into rioting and looting.

What is the answer to the food security issue?

Those who have followed our reporting on this issue for the past decade or so will know that my position is that government is NOT the solution, but the problem.

Government food policies are what have created the fragile system we have created, with their cheap subsidized commodity food systems along with their fragile supply chains that are so easily disrupted.

No, the answer to food security lies in YOU, the American consumer. Small businesses all across the country, like many of those featured in the articles reported by Civil Eats, are happy to step in and fill in the gaps. They don’t need, and I am sure most do not want, government subsidies to fuel their businesses.

They need you, the American consumer, to start changing their buying habits, and start supporting local businesses.

We need a return to the “old fashion” way of conducting business, where there is a town butcher, a town baker, local grain mills, and local dairy farms and other kinds of farms producing and selling meats, produce, dairy, and other food staples to the consumer directly through local businesses.

Those in the metropolitan areas need to find like-minded neighbors and fellow city residents to band together and form co-ops and buying clubs to support farmers that may be located further out in the rural areas, to more efficiently bring that food from the farm to the tables of those in the cities.

When this country was founded in the 1700s, 90% of the population was involved in agriculture. When the Civil War started under President Lincoln, it was about 50% of the population in agriculture feeding the other 50%.

Today it is less than 1% of the population feeding the other 99%, and just a handful of companies controlling the nation’s food supply.

There is only one way we are going to see more food security in our nation, and it begins with the American consumer, and the consumer’s willingness to sacrifice “convenience” to have one-stop shopping centers that offer everything at cheaper prices (and almost always also cheaper quality food) due to government subsidies.

Will it happen? Will this be enough of a wake-up call to get even 10 percent of the nation’s population to change their buying habits? Because that is probably all it will take to turn the tide and start things rolling in the right direction.

But if everyone sits around and waits for the government to provide solutions, we can see what their history is. They will decide who to bail out and who not to bail out, and they will decide who wins and who loses. And we all know how that turns out.

If government truly wants to help bring food security to our nation’s food supply chains, then the best thing they can do is REMOVE barriers that prevent direct farm-to-consumer sales, such as the Wyoming Food Freedom Act that we highlighted earlier this month, and then get out of the way and let consumers and small businesses flourish in this nation once again.

As long as we still have a vestige of a free society left, the American consumer is still the most powerful force to change our food security problem in the U.S.",fake

Blum, known for his work in movies like “Desperately Seeking Susan” and “Crocodile Dundee,” as well as a host of Broadway and off-Broadway theater productions and television works, was 69. He is survived by his wife, actress Janet Zarish.

Rebecca Damon, vice president of SAG-AFTRA, confirmed Blum’s death: ”It is with such deep sorrow that I’m writing to share the news that our friend and former board member Mark Blum has passed away as a result of complications from the coronavirus.”

News of Blum’s death follows the announcement Tuesday of the coronavirus-related death of Broadway playwright Terrence McNally.

Blum made his Broadway debut in 1977’s “The Merchant” and appeared in works ranging from “Lost in Yonkers” to both revivals of Gore Vidal’s “The Best Man.”

His last appearance on the Great White Way was in 2013’s “The Assembled Parties.”

An actor to the end, his last off-Broadway appearance was in September’s “Fern Hill.”

On the silver screen, he was known for “Crocodile Dundee,” “Desperately Seeking Susan” and “Shattered Glass,” and was a staple on television, including a recent role in the thriller “You” as bookshop owner Mr. Moody. He also was featured on “Fraiser,” Hulu’s ”Mozart in the Jungle” and HBO’s “The Sopranos,” among many others.

Outpourings of love peppered social media Thursday morning as news of Blum’s death spread.

Playwrights Horizons announced his death on Twitter, saying, “With love and heavy hearts, Playwrights Horizons pays tribute to Mark Blum, a dear longtime friend and a consummate artist who passed this week. Thank you, Mark, for all you brought to our theater, and to theaters and audiences across the world. We will miss you.”

Damon’s tribute to Blum continued: “Mark was a dedicated Screen Actors Guild and SAG-AFTRA board member serving from 2007-2013, a passionate champion for merger, and a tireless advocate for members. Those of us lucky enough to have known him will treasure our memories of a gifted actor, a master teacher, a loyal friend and a beautiful human.

“On a personal note — I always appreciated Mark’s clear perception of complex situations. He always spoke the truth and did a great service in informing members of our community about the ins and outs of the union whenever he had the opportunity.

“Mark was smart, funny, and a true actor’s actor. He will be deeply missed. Thinking of you all. Please #stayhome. #COVID19”

Actress Judith Light tweeted, “Mark Blum, so generous, so kind, so humble, so talented. Our time together in the play ‘The Assembled Parties’ at MTC was a true joy. May he rest in peace knowing that he transformed the lives of so many and was cherished by so many; me among them.”

Actor Josh Radnor said, “When I was in drama school Mark Blum was exactly the kind of actor I aspired to be: constantly employed, deeply respected, total mensch. Gutted to hear of his passing. His wife Janet Zarish was my acting teacher at NYU. They were the loveliest couple. My heart breaks for her.”

Playwright Heidi Schreck wrote, “Oh this is devastating. The brilliant and generous Mark Blum was such a life giving force in New York theater. We will miss you dearly.”

Princess Cruises spokeswoman Negin Kamali said 170 employees are currently aboard the ship bound for Port Dickson, Malaysia, ""to finalize crew repatriation efforts and remain until operations begin."" Details about crew members' nationalities and repatriation details were not immediately available.

The ship had been docked in Japan since early February, where officials attempted to quarantine its 3,700 passengers and crew for two weeks after 10 initial coronavirus cases were reported Feb. 4.

Eventually, 712 people who had been on the ship tested positive, and 13 died, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. By mid-February, it was the largest coronavirus outbreak outside China, where the pandemic is believed to have begun in December.

Around 400 American citizens were evacuated on two State Department charter flights in late February, including 14 who had tested positive. Public health experts have widely criticized the quarantine and the subsequent evacuation for worsening the outbreak.

""The quarantine process failed,"" Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading infectious disease expert, told the USA TODAY editorial board in February. ""I'd like to sugarcoat it and try to be diplomatic about it, but it failed.""

Another coronavirus outbreak in early March on the Grand Princess and a growing global crisis led the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to issue a no-sail order for cruise ships March 14. The no-sail order was extended and is in force through late July.

The Diamond Princess has lingered in Japan in the meantime. Kamali said the ship left Yokohama, Japan, on Saturday.

About 200 employees replaced mattresses, bedding, linens and room ornaments as part of a sanitation and refurbishment project while the ship was docked at the Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Yokohama Dockyard and Machinery Works.

Kamali said Japan home port cruises on the Diamond Princess have been canceled through Oct. 1. Princess said earlier this month that it would cancel cruises through the end of the summer season, citing the reduction in flight schedules and the closure of cruise ship ports.",real

402,https://www.worldhealth.net/news/swedens-approach-dealing-covid-19/,2020-04-22,Sweden’s Approach To Dealing With COVID-19,"Ander Tegnell the epidemiologist behind the country’s controversial strategy recently had an interview with Nature to explain the “trust based” approach to tackling the COVID-19 outbreak, the following is an excerpt of that interview:

Much of the world has imposed severe restrictions on public life in recent months to try and slow the spread of this virus, among them there is one country standing out from the crowd: Sweden. In this country there is no lock down or strict social distancing policies. Rather this country has imposed a voluntary trust based measure that advises those who are older or with existing conditions to avoid social contact; it recommends people work from home, wash their hands regularly, and people should avoid non-essential travel.

Another more glaring difference is that in Sweden the borders and schools for children under the age of 16 remain open, as do many businesses including bars and restaurants. Their unique approach is gaining attention from critics among whom 22 scientists wrote an article in the newspaper Dagens Nyheter that public health authorities are failing and they urged politicians to step in an impose stricter measures pointing to a high number of deaths in elder care homes and the overall fatality rate which is the highest reported of the Nordic neighbours.

Ander Tegnell is an epidemiologist at the Public Health Agency in Sweden and is the architect behind their strategy who suggests that it is overstated how unique their approach is, as they too are aiming to flatten the curve to slow down the spread as much as possible as to not collapse the healthcare system.

Tegnell says this is not a disease that can be stopped or eradicated, as such there needs to be long term solutions that keep the distribution of infections at a decent level. Every country is trying to keep people apart by using the same measures and traditions, and this is one of the reasons they ended up doing things slightly different.

The laws on communicable diseases are mostly based on voluntary measures in Sweden, falling on an individual’s own responsibility, clearly stating that each citizen has the responsibility to not spread a disease. In Sweden using their present laws there is not much legal possibility to close down cities, a quarantine can be contemplated for people or small areas such as a hotel or a school but they legally are not able to lock down an entire geographical area.

In his view closing borders, lock downs and close downs have nothing to do with historical scientific basis, when they were investigating European countries to examine published analysis of the effects of these measures almost none were found. Thus in his opinion closing borders is ridiculous because COVID-19 is in every country now, and they have more concerns about movements inside of Sweden. In order to be effective those measures needed to be implemented immediately to be effective, as once it has spread it is too late.

In Sweden as a society they are more into nudging and continuously reminding people to use safety measures, working to improve measures as they are seen to need to be adjusted day to day, and there is no need to close everything down completely because it would be counterproductive.

Every morning the Swedish Public Health Agency meets to review and update decisions and adjust recommendations as needed according to data collection and analysis, talking to regional authorities twice a week.

Currently the big debate is regarding elder care homes where the country is registering a very unfortunate outbreak of the coronavirus which largely accounts for Sweden’s higher death rate as compared to the Nordic neighbors. To better understand which recommendations are not being followed and why not investigations are ongoing to make adjustments to try and correct the situation.

Although the country is being criticized for being too relaxed and possibly putting citizen lives at risk Tegnell does not believe there is that risk. Public health officials have released a detailed model on a region by region basis that comes to less pessimistic conclusions than that of other researchers in terms of hospitalizations and deaths per thousand infections. While there has been an increase in cases it is not traumatic so far, he says adding that the country is currently in a phase where there will be more cases during the next few weeks, just as every country either has or will experience, and nowhere in Europe has the spread been able to be slowed down considerably.

According to Tegnell the science does not support closing down schools at this point. In an epidemic to get an effect you have to shut things such as schools down early, and we are now close to the top of the curve so closing down schools would be meaningless at this point. It makes more sense along with being more instrumental for psychiatric and physical health that the younger generation remains active.

While there is a possibility asymptomatics are contagious, the amount of spread is mostly likely small compared to those showing symptoms as in the normal distribution of a bell curve asymptomatics sit at the margin whereas the majority of the curve is accountable to symptomatics which are the ones we really need to stop, says Tegnell.

Tegnell says that it is too early to know if their approach will be successful. Every country needs to reach herd immunity in one way or another, and Sweden is going to reach it in a different way. Some argue that keeping people in quarantine will limit their exposure and hault developing natural immunity needed to develop herd immunity. Just as the common cold or flu we once had no immunity, and many people died, which is the same as with this virus. Herd immunity is when a high proportion of the population becomes immune to an infection which largely limits the spread to those who are not immune, and quarantine undermines this process. According to Tegnell there are enough signals to show that we can think about herd immunity for this virus, how long it will last is unknown, but there is a definite immune response.

Tegnell believes that they underestimated the issues that would arise at elder care homes, and how the measures would or in this case would not be applied, and they should have controlled this more thoroughly in these communities.

Thus far he is satisfied with this strategy, and most of the problems the country is facing at the moment are not because of the disease, rather because the recommended measures in some environments have not been applied properly such as the deaths among older people which is a huge problem they are trying to fight hard against.

Looking at pandemics there are far worse scenarios than this one, Tegnell has data showing that the flu epidemic and winter norovirus dropped consistently this year which means that the social distancing and hand washing recommendations are working. Tracking models show that the movements in Swedes has fallen dramatically, and the voluntary strategy is having a real effect, adds Tegnell.",fake

Everyone else will receive a 10 percent pay cut, and Tesla said that workers outside the US will see “comparable reductions.” The pay cuts will last through the second financial quarter, which ends in June.

It’s unclear how many hourly workers will be placed on unpaid leave. But it is likely a significant number, as Tesla said that anyone who cannot work from home and has not been given “critical work” to do at one of the company’s facilities will be affected by the furlough. Tesla employs around 50,000 people worldwide.

There is no specific mention of CEO Elon Musk in the email. Musk, who underplayed the coronavirus threat in March and tweeted that the “panic” over it was “dumb” is a few years into a $2.6 billion compensation plan at Tesla, though he has not accepted the state-mandated minimum wage salary in the past.

A “shared sacrifice”

Valerie Capers Workman, the company’s North American HR boss, said in the email that these workers will get a specific notice via email with “additional instructions on how to apply for unemployment benefits through [their] state agency,” and that “[f]or the vast majority of furloughed employees, unemployment benefits will be roughly equivalent to normal take home pay.” They will “remain an employee of Tesla (without pay)” while on furlough, and keep their healthcare benefits.

“On one hand we are devastated by this, we all want to get back to work. On the other hand we all know we are going to get way more money from unemployment since all the extras won’t be taken out,” one hourly employee at Tesla’s Fremont, California factory told The Verge. “[We are] happy we will be able to support our families better than when we were working.”

The employee, who was granted anonymity to speak freely about the situation, said their team is also happy not to be putting coworkers’ health at risk during the pandemic.

Tesla temporarily shut down its electric car factory in California on March 23rd, along with its solar panel factory in New York. The company has also already shrunk its workforce at the Nevada Gigafactory, where it makes batteries and some parts for the Model 3, by “more than 75 percent.”

But many of those workers were on paid leave, at least until the new pay cuts and furloughs were announced on Tuesday. And Workman said in Tuesday’s email that the company won’t resume production at its US facilities until at least May 4th, which is the earliest the furloughed workers will be called back. (California’s stay-at-home order currently runs through May 3rd, but can be extended.)

“We know that the uncertainty has not been easy, and we are doing everything we can to keep you safe and informed while also navigating the changes around the world,” Workman wrote in the email. The pay cuts and furloughs are part of a “broader effort to manage costs,” she said. “This is a shared sacrifice across the company that will allow us to progress during these challenging times.”

The cuts come just a few days after Tesla announced better-than-expected sales figures for the first quarter of 2020, thanks in part to the company’s new Gigafactory in China, which was also briefly shut down in February. When Tesla announced the suspension of operations at the California and New York factories last month, the company cited its $6.3 billion cash stockpile and a recent $2.3 billion raise as reasons for shareholder reassurance.

“We believe this level of liquidity is sufficient to successfully navigate an extended period of uncertainty,” the company wrote at the time.

Still, even the legacy automakers are taking similar actions as they head into what is expected to be a far worse second quarter for new vehicle sales. Just hours before Workman’s email went out, Nissan and Honda announced tens of thousands of hourly factory workers were being put on furlough, adding to a growing list of people who need unemployment benefits that’s already 10 million names long thanks to the pandemic.",real

Rural hospitals may not be able to keep their doors open as the coronavirus pandemic saps their cash, their CEOs warn, just as communities most need them.

As the coronavirus sweeps across the United States, all hospitals are facing cancellations of doctor visits and procedures by a terrified populace — profitable services that usually help fund hospitals. Meanwhile, the institutions also find themselves needing to pay higher prices for personal protective equipment such as face masks and other gear that's in short supply. Vice President Mike Pence called on hospitals nationwide Wednesday to delay elective surgeries to free up capacity and resources for future coronavirus patients.

The American Hospital Association responded Thursday by asking Congress for $100 billion for all hospitals to offset coronavirus costs, citing rural hospitals' inability to withstand huge losses for long.

""If we're not able to address the short-term cash needs of rural hospitals, we're going to see hundreds of rural hospitals close before this crisis ends,"" warned Alan Morgan, the head of the National Rural Health Association, which represents 21,000 health care providers and hospitals. ""This is not hyperbole.""

Well before the COVID-19 threat, rural health care's profitability had collapsed nationwide due to a combination of narrowing Medicare reimbursements, a larger share of patients lacking high-paying private insurance and the hollowing out of rural America. Given such pressures, more than 120 rural hospitals have been forced to close over the past decade.

Those hospitals in small-town America that have survived rely heavily on moneymakers such as elective surgeries, physical therapy and lab tests to make their razor-thin margins work. But, according to the Chicago-based Chartis Center for Rural Health, almost half of them still operate in the red.

So the added financial hit from the coronavirus outbreak could be the final straw for many rural hospitals — exposing the complicated business dynamics at play within the United States' critical public health infrastructure.

""This virus, and what it is causing for these hospitals, is the perfect storm that will close these hospitals at a time this country critically needs them,"" says Robin Rau, CEO of Miller County Hospital in southwestern Georgia. ""This is going to be the death blow to them.""

Two weeks ago, she started eliminating all medical services that were not urgent. She estimates that has cut off at least half of the hospital's revenue. Other CEOs warned similar cuts at their hospitals mean they won't make payroll in the coming weeks.

The National Rural Health Association, along with many rural hospital executives, is lobbying for immediate cash assistance, no-interest loans, Medicare reimbursement adjustments and other suggestions to alleviate the pain. The association favors a bailout plan from Sens. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., and Michael Bennet, D-Colo., which in early drafts called for the equivalent of a three-month advance based on hospitals' previous patient numbers, according to Bennet's office.

""Rural hospitals have already been closing their doors at startling rates, and this crisis will only exacerbate that fact,"" Bennet tells KHN in a written statement. ""There is an incredible opportunity for rural hospitals to shoulder some of the burdens of caring for patients and helping to meet possible bed shortages.""

Still, many rural hospital CEOs worry any assistance may come too late.

""And yet I hear they're going to bail out the cruise lines? Really?"" Missouri's Scotland County Hospital CEO Dr. Randy Tobler says.

As Tobler looks at his older, sicker, underinsured patient population, he says he is afraid the hospital, located on the state's northeastern rural border, might last only until May before running out of money for payroll.

""In the truly safety-net areas, we're being called to high duty,"" he says. ""And we're running on fumes.""

Michael Purvis, CEO of Candler County Hospital in Metter, Ga., says he's already fallen into a negative cash flow situation in the past week. The number of patients coming to his hospital, which is about 65 miles outside Savannah, for profitable outpatient procedures has dropped by half as people in droves have canceled their surgeries, MRIs and physical therapy. Purvis has implemented fever checks of people at the entrance. But he remains fearful that his billing staff could be forced to quarantine themselves if they fall ill — effectively shutting off the hospital's revenue.

""If my billers and coders stay healthy, I can make it to April, maybe end of June,"" Purvis says.

On top of the massive loss of revenue, Julie Jones, CEO at Community Hospital-Fairfax in northwestern Missouri, says she can only get specialty N95 respirator masks that offer critical protection for her front-line providers for about $5 each — more than 16 times the normal cost of 30 cents.

Angela Ammons, CEO of Clinch Memorial Hospital in Homerville, Ga., says she has warned staff that if hand sanitizer and disinfecting wipes continue to go missing, she'll watch the video footage and fire on the spot anyone caught stealing supplies. And she is so worried about running out of protective equipment, she's asking any of her ""crafty"" staff with sewing machines to sew cotton masks.

""I would rather staff go in with a fabric mask than no mask at all,"" she says.

To be sure, rural hospitals are not as equipped as larger hospital systems to handle the most serious coronavirus cases. Many are not outfitted with ICUs or enough doctors and staff to handle multiple intensive care patients. That means they have to transfer those patients to larger hospitals.

Still, rural experts argue that their bed and health care capacity can be leveraged to keep potential coronavirus cases out of the major hospitals. Plus, rural facilities could be places for initial triage or eventual recovery care.

And if nothing changes, Rau worries, the country is about to lose this critical public health infrastructure.

""We can talk all we want about the cost of health care in this country in this ridiculous health care system we have,"" she says. ""But at a time like this, who for a minute would think about getting rid of rural hospitals?""

In response, Moog and Korg have both made certain synth apps free for a limited time.

Moog’s Minimoog Model D iOS app is now free, and it cost $4.99 when it was introduced in 2018. It’s a faithful visual reproduction of the hardware version (which will set you back a few thousand bucks). Since it’s digital, Moog took a few liberties and added capabilities not available in its physical counterpart. For example, the hardware Minimoog Model D can only produce one note at a time, but up to four notes can be played at once on the app.

Korg is also making its Kaossilator app for iOS and Android free for a limited time. Kaossilator is mainly for making tracks based on layering loops and has a ton of tools for playing around with 150 built-in sounds. Also, there are ways to lock scale and key so you can noodle around without any musical knowledge and make something that sounds decent. This app normally costs $19.99 and is free until March 31st.

Moog said the move was done to “spread positivity, creativity, and expressivity,” while Korg says the offering is a way to “help you with a musical way to occupy your mind.”

If you want to get even more down the rabbit hole, there are a few other free synth apps for iOS, like AudioKit’s Synth One and Tenacious Frog’s TF7 Synth (which is free, but offers in-app purchases). And of course, there are a variety of other free music-making and modulating apps like GarageBand, Korg Gadget 2 Le, Launchpad, and pitch-processing app Voloco, which I fell in love with after an auto-tuned cat went viral on Twitter. I highly recommend it.

States clamoring for coronavirus tests in recent weeks have been talking about two types.

First, there's a PCR test that detects the virus's genetic material and so can confirm an active infection. And then there's an antibody test, which looks at the body's reaction to that infection and so is useful in identifying people who have been infected with the virus in the past.

Now, there's a third kind of test under development to help fight COVID-19 that homes in on proteins that stud the virus's outer surface; it, too, detects an active infection. Known as an antigen test, this one could offer a much easier and more widely available alternative for diagnosis than the PCR test, proponents say, though some other scientists remain concerned about the test's reliability.

""We have to have a breakthrough innovation in testing,"" Dr. Deborah Birx of the White House coronavirus task force said recently on Meet the Press in her most recent pitch for antigen tests. ""We have to be able to detect antigen rather than constantly trying to detect the actual live virus or the viral particles itself.""

Though there are no authorized coronavirus antigen tests on the market yet, several companies are already working on them, including one that has started seeking a stamp of approval from the Food and Drug Administration.

""It's very exciting,"" says Lee Gehrke, a microbiologist at Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who is involved with E25BIO, a Cambridge, Mass., company developing the test. ""It could change the landscape for testing.""

OraSure Technologies Inc. of Bethlehem, Pa., is also developing an antigen test that would enable people to test themselves at home from a saliva sample.

""Having a rapid antigen — in-home — self-test will help both combat the virus and also individual fear,"" says Stephen Tang, the company's chief executive officer. ""It actually gives the individual a bit of control and understanding — whether they're infectious and whether family members are infectious. So I think it starts to get us back in a mindset where we can control our destiny.""

Public health experts agree that such a test could be very helpful.

""Rapid antigen tests would be valuable because of their speed,"" Tom Inglesby, who directs the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, wrote in an email.

But Inglesby and others caution that any antigen tests would have to be carefully vetted to make sure they're accurate. Relaxed oversight by the FDA recently has raised concerns about the reliability of some other kinds of tests — such as antibody tests — which are being marketed aggressively by some companies with unverified claims.

When used to look for other types of infections, such as testing for the flu, or for strep in someone with a sore throat, antigen tests have tended to miss more infected people than the PCR tests for the coronavirus typically do, experts say.

""We know an awful lot about the performance of antigen detection tests,"" says Frederick Nolte, who heads testing at the Medical University of South Carolina. ""And we know that that sensitivity leaves a lot to be desired.""

Generally, antigen tests tend to miss about 15 to 20% of infections, Nolte and others say, and that's likely not good enough for many uses of a diagnostic test for the coronavirus.

""If you're using this test to screen people to make sure that they're not infected, and that they go back to work or things like that, then you'd be giving people the message that they are not infected when actually they are — and therefore transmitting the new coronavirus,"" says Jesse Papenburg, an infectious disease expert at McGill University.

The tests currently used to see whether people are actively infected with the virus are sophisticated molecular tests that can spot its genetic material in specimens swabbed from inside people's noses and throats. Most use the technique known as polymerase chain reaction — PCR — to generate and analyze millions of copies of genetic sequences from the virus.

But those tests require sophisticated equipment, highly trained technicians and complicated processes that use specialized chemicals; those strict requirements of PCR tests, and problems in reliably meeting them, have contributed to the testing shortage.

Wide-scale testing is considered crucial for determining the scope of the pandemic, bringing it under control and keeping large new outbreaks from occurring. Testing enables public health authorities to spot new infections quickly so patients can be isolated and so anyone they might have had contact with.

Typically, antigen tests are much easier and less expensive to manufacture and simpler to perform than either PCR tests or antibody tests. The same technology is used in pregnancy tests.

""It looks very much like a pregnancy test. And they're very simple. They don't require special chemicals or training to use them. And they can give you a read out in about 15 minutes or so,"" says Gehrke, one of the collaborators on the E25BIO test.

Gehrke says his company's test appears to be very accurate when evaluated with samples of the virus in the lab.

""The difficult question — and the one we want to ask — is how well does it perform on samples from real patients,"" Gehrke says.

Papenburg questions whether antigen test could ever be as reliable as the genetic tests because, unlike those PCR tests, they can't produce large quantities of the target proteins — so might be more likely to miss an infection.

Tang says OraSure is also conducting careful studies to ensure the company's test would be reliable — able to not only detect an infection with the novel coronavirus, but also to quickly and accurately discern it from other coronaviruses, such as those that cause the common cold.

""Our aiming point for our rapid antigen test is to make it highly sensitive and highly specific,"" Tang says, though he acknowledges that it remains to be seen how the test will compare to the molecular tests. It could turn out the antigen test's results would have to be confirmed by the PCR tests, Tang says.

Another company, Mologic in the United Kingdom, is developing an antigen test and hopes to get it approved by June, according to Fionna Tod, a company spokeswoman. The test would produce results in 10 minutes and would sell for about $1, she says, which could be very helpful in less affluent parts of the world.

In an email, the company's medical director, Joe Fitchett, noted that genetic tests often use samples gathered through an uncomfortable procedure that involves swabbing deep into the nose.

""PCR tests using nasal swabs can be deeply uncomfortable, and poor technique is well-documented to lead to false negatives,"" Fitchett says. ""On the other hand, saliva that can be deployed in a rapid antigen test and could offer better, more user-friendly performance — that will be critical for a self-test.""

During a briefing Wednesday announcing a $1.5 billion effort to speed the development of new coronavirus tests, National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins said it could be possible to develop reliable antigen tests.

""While traditionally, antigen-based tests have lower sensitivity and specificity than do nucleic acid tests, I don't believe there's any law of physics that says that has to be the case,"" Collins said.",real

A new bill has been introduced into the 116th Congress (2019-2020) of the U.S. House of Representatives named H.R.6666 - COVID-19 Testing, Reaching, And Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act, with the potential to further the loss of the already vanishing health freedoms of each and every citizen of the United States. You can stand with us today by opposing H.R.6666 now (use this link to Take A Stand)

H.R. 6666, despite having been introduced by Rep. Bobby L. Rush [D-IL-1] and referred to the Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on the same day almost two weeks ago on 5/01/2020, has received little mainstream media coverage to this date, other than recent attempts to debunk claims that it would further violate the rights of Americans. As of 5/14/2020 is has 59 co-sponsors, including one Republican, indicating the potential that it may gain greater bipartisan support unless strongly opposed.

H.R. 6666 authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Director of the CDC, to allocate a 100 billion dollars, annually (or until the national COVID emergency is declared over), to employ, train, and deploy an immense workforce of “testing and contact tracers” to be sent directly to everyone’s homes for diagnostic testing and tracing of contacts suspected to have been infected or are at risk of infection with COVID-19. The bill uses broad yet highly vague language to describe the role of this veritable army of new agents of the emerging U.S. medical police state “for other purposes,” such as “support the quarantine of such contacts.”

The nebulous language of H.R. 6666 affords the government and public and private grantees under its coordination unusually broad discretion to apply its newly granted police powers under the presently defined “national COVID health emergency.” Since the national lockdown began on March the 15th, we’ve witnessed the near complete suspension of most of our Constitutionally irrevocable civil liberties, with the near complete cessation and/or modification of all socio-economic activity within the country. Moreover, executive orders have already been enacted throughout this country enabling the forced seizure of body tissue and fluids, property, forced vaccination, testing, isolation, quarantine and arrest without due process. While not all of these draconian regulations have yet been implemented en masse, they exist in the letter of the law and therefore could be enforced, especially given that bills such as H.R.6666 use broad discretionary language leaving it to the government to intepret its meaning and apply force as it sees fit. If H.R. 6666 passes, real ""teeth"" would be put to many of the laws, acts, orders, and regulations that have been passed as executive orders over the past two months, potentially locking the entire country into an irreversible control grid the likes of which we have not seen outside of countries like China.

In light of this, H.R. 6666 may be setting the stage for the implementation of what WHO director Dr. Mike Ryan of the WHO and Ventura County California officials, say will include forcibly removing family members found positive or suspected of being infected. The only way to prevent this is to make sure the bill is opposed and dies.

Eligible recipients of funds include “faith-based” and “school-based” institutions, implying that these organizations might also become, in part, testing or treatment centers.

What is Contract Tracing?

Take a few minutes to watch the important reports by independent journalists Spyro Skouras and James Corbett on the contact tracing agenda in the rapidly unfolding story of coronavirus.

Contract tracing, which on the surface appears to mitigate the risk of disease spread by identifying carriers and interfering their further contact with the healthy, is based on a series of flawed assumptions:

The disease known as COVID-19 and believed to be caused by a singular infectious disease entity, i.e. the viral particle known as SARS-CoV-2, has never been validated through Koch postulates to be inducible and solely caused by SARS-CoV-2 within a controlled clinical or experimental setting. Over 100 different types of coronavirus have already been identified in circulation naturally around the world, and there is serious doubt that we can adequately distinguish between natural extracellular vesicles such as human exosomes and novel or endogenous forms of coronovirus already present in the human virome with the tests being used today, namely, RT-PCR. Learn more about this at www.questioningcovid.com That so-called “positive cases” identified through any number of over 100 different PCR-based and antibody-testing methods are accurate indicators of the presence of COVID-19, or do not generate false positives. If false positives are not accounted for, contract tracing can cause or contribute to a falsely expanding epidemic and those who are unnecessarily quarantined and treated will succumb to greatly elevated iatrogenically induced morbidity and mortality risks, which will never be discovered because the so-called “confirmed case fatality rates for COVID-19” require no viral testing, and only “suspicion of infection.” This is because the WHO and US Vital Statistics agencies explicitly advise against confirming these suspicion-based deaths through viral testing and other clinical means, in an egregious departure from both science and evidence-based medicine.

If contact tracing is fraught with technical inadequacies, why would it be so aggressively implemented nationwide? One reason is that it provides a justification for total spectrum dominance via real-time surveillance and control of the entire population under the auspices of “public health safety,” into perpetuity. In essence, it is like a new “war on terror,” but with the enemy being defined as our own bodies, or contact between bodies, and the solution the complete removal of any privacy, nor right to exempt oneself or children from medical mandates. The system would likely include tracking GPS data of mobile device users and then following back their contacts to identify, test, isolate, quarantine, medicate, or otherwise vaccinate them when one becomes available most likely in the fall of 2020. The media has already fomented profound fear through misreporting, misrepresenting, and catastrophizing case fatality projections, over the past few months. Their egregious disregard for the truth has lead to socioenomic and psychobiological impacts that are arguably orders of magnitude more harmful and deadly than this, or any other virus believed to contribute to flu-like illness. Clearly, the media and power that be could re-manufacture another crisis, or “second” or “third” wave simply be repeating what they have already one (learn more on the topic via the Corbett Report). At which point, with an army of contact tracers, testers, quarantine enforcers, and medicators and vaccinators, the systems being funded by H.R. 6666 would be ready to further this agenda.

So, why does H.R. 6666 refrain from providing even the most rudimentary details to how one of the largest and most widespread in impact bills ever introduced will impact those affected? The more vague and broad the language, the less oversight. The truth is that the detailed plans for how H.R.666 will be implemented were already written and revealed to the public a month ago by the Rockefeller Foundation in a 30-page plan titled, “NATIONAL COVID-19 TESTING ACTION PLAN:Pragmatic steps to reopen our workplaces and our communities.” Not coincidentally, the plan proposed the exact same dollar figure was required - 100 billion dollars -- and suggested that between 100-300,000 contract tracers would be needed.

1356,https://www.worldhealth.net/news/new-data-suggest-covid-19-may-not-be-deadly-thought/,2020-05-18,New Data Suggest COVID-19 May Not Be As Deadly As Thought,"With more antibody testing being done a recent study has found that there may be as many as 50-85% as many infections as there are known cases, based on their findings, this suggests that there could actually be a lower fatality rate and COVID-19 may not be as deadly as we once thought. This is not to say that it is not something to be concerned about, especially for those with pre-existing conditions, just that the fatality rates may be lower.

The shut down and lock downs of recent months have all been based on the premise that COVID-19 would kill more than 2 million Americans without taking some serious actions to slow down the spread of the virus, as we didn’t have any immunity to this novel disease. The model used at that time assumed the case fatality rates being at 1-3%, and at the time W.H.O estimated a case fatality rate of 3.4%.

Some experts are questioning these assumptions, arguing that without widespread accurate testing the known cases are likely to be only a very small portion of the true number of infections given the ease of spread, and thus high case fatality rate could be well off the mark by orders of magnitude. The truth is that we don’t know what portion of infections have gone undetected and probably since cleared in the vast majority of the population due to lack of testing, the highly restrictive qualifications to get tested, and the potentially large incidence of mild illness or asymptomatic infection to this highly contagious virus running amok since January at an unknown rate.

As the weeks pass more data is being released supporting these views such as a recent preliminary study from researchers at Stanford which conducted a seroprevalence study of Santa Clara County, California on April 3-4, 2020 studying a representative sampling of 3,300 residents to test for the presence of antibodies in their blood to show if they had previously been infected with COVID-19.

This study revealed that the Bay Area infections based on the antibody testing were 85 times higher than what had been reported, which is largely due to the lack of testing and asymptomatic carriers allowing the virus to spread unknown. The researchers suggest that their data may help to better estimate the true fatality rate of this virus; the population prevalence of COVID-19 in Santa Clara among the 3,300 adults and children ranged from 2.49% to 4.16%.

“The most important implication of these findings is that the number of infections is much greater than the reported number of cases,” the researchers wrote, in a yet-to-be peer-reviewed study. “Our data imply that, by April 1 (three days prior to the end of our survey) between 48,000 and 81,000 people had been infected in Santa Clara County. The reported number of confirmed positive cases in the county on April 1 was 956, 50-85-fold lower than the number of infections predicted by this study.”

“Many estimates of fatality rate use a ratio of deaths to lagged cases (because of duration from case confirmation to death), with an infections-to-cases ratio in the 1-5 fold range as an estimate of under-ascertainment,” the researchers wrote. “Our study suggests that adjustments for under-ascertainment may need to be much higher.”

Detecting previously unreported cases of COVID-19 infections could lead to a better estimation of the fatality rate. This study was not without limitations, but after adjustments were made to take these into account the researchers suggest these results could be applied to other areas.

“While our study was limited to Santa Clara County, it demonstrates the feasibility of seroprevalence surveys of population samples now, and in the future, to inform our understanding of this pandemic’s progression, project estimates of community vulnerability, and monitor infection fatality rates in different populations over time,” the researchers said. “It is also an important tool for reducing uncertainty about the state of the epidemic, which may have important public benefits.”

“This probably aligns with what overall national exposure may be, on order of about 5 percent once we do wide serology,” tweeted Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former FDA commissioner, agreeing that these findings likely align with what the overall national exposure may look like. “Santa Clara was a hot spot and I would have expected exposure to be higher. Overall we’re probably diagnosing 1 in 10 to 1 in 20 infections.”

Gottlieb also suggests that other hot zones such as New York that have reported over 223,000 cases of infection have data “to suggest the infection rate may be much higher.”

“We’re also likely to find higher rates of infection among certain jobs,” he tweeted. “But the data so far suggest that nationally, total exposure is still low.”

As several states begin to cautiously reopen there has been an increased push for antibody testing which, if accurate, may be able to reveal who already had the virus who may not have been tested for it. Antibody testing can be conducted via blood but can also be done using saliva looking to detect IgM and IgG antibodies that can take up to 14 days to develop.

“Those who test positive for immunity, in theory, are safe to return to work but it is to be very cautioned against doing so considering medical professionals are still learning about this virus,” said Dr. Robert Segal. “The human race has not developed an immunity to this virus, there is a possibility that re-infections could occur. We cannot be certain of that at this time.”

Accuracy of these rushed to market tests have however been called into question. As with any test accuracy is always a concern, and many of these rushed serology tests have yet to be approved by the FDA.

John Brownstein an epidemiologist at Boston Children’s Hospital said that there is growing recognition in the field that the numbers of those infected are far greater than the official numbers, and ultimately he says about this study that, “It adds to growing body of work that suggests a huge amount of cases that went undetected.”",fake

At the end of the day, I’m not gonna let it stop me from partying,” adding “We’re just out here having a good time. Whatever happens, happens.”

In case you were wondering how far these spring break ‘covidiots’ traveled for their ill-advised debauchery data visualization company Tectonix used cell phone location data collected by company X-Mode to map out the travels of thousands of spring breakers, using special geo-spatial big-data analysis software.

The data – provided by cell phone companies in near real-time, was anonymized.

Watch:

This shows the location data of phones that were on a Florida beach during Spring Break. It then shows where those phones traveled.

CEO Paul Hudson previously said the US ""has the right"" to get the vaccine first should the drug prove effective because the country had contributed the most to Sanofi's vaccine project.

These remarks were criticized by French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe and President Emmanuel Macron, who said no country should have priority over the drug.

On Friday, Serge Weinberg, the chairman of Sanofi's board of directors, intervened, promising no country would get priority.

Sanofi has long received funding from the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority. In February, BARDA sent an extra $30 million to fund Sanofi's vaccine program.

The French pharmaceutical giant Sanofi has reneged on its pledge to give the US priority access to a coronavirus vaccine it's developing after a backlash from the highest levels of French government.

CEO Paul Hudson had said on Wednesday that because the US had spent millions of dollars to support Sanofi's work on a vaccine, it ""has the right to the largest preorder."" Sanofi is developing two vaccines, neither of which has been approved for use yet.

Hudson's logic was met with outrage in France and across the European Union.

A vaccine is ""a global public good, which is not submitted to market forces,"" the office of President Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday.

Prime Minister Edouard Philippe echoed those sentiments, tweeting: ""Equal access for all to vaccine is not negotiable.""

For Philippe, it was also a matter of loyalty to France. ""I just reminded Serge Weinberg who chairs Sanofi that this is a great deeply French company,"" he also said.

On Friday, Weinberg, the chairman of Sanofi's board of directors, intervened.

""I am going to be extremely clear: There will be no particular advance for any country,"" Weinberg told France 2 TV.

Macron had also been ""affected"" by Hudson's interview, a source told Bloomberg. The Sanofi CEO has been summoned to meet with Macron next Tuesday.

Sanofi has long received US government funding from the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority.

On February 18, Sanofi announced a new partnership with BARDA, with a new $30 million cash injection to help the search for a vaccine. At the time, Sanofi had already been working on a vaccine by leveraging its research on SARS, another respiratory disease.

Hudson told Bloomberg earlier this week that because the US was first to fund Sanofi's research, it expected ""that if we've helped you manufacture the doses at risk, we expect to get the doses first.""

As a result of the collaboration with BARDA, Hudson said the US could ""expect to get the doses first"" in return for its support.

Critics of the arrangement have pointed out that Sanofi benefits from tax credits from the French state.

The French Socialist Party estimates the French government has saved Sanofi at least 150 million euros, or $162 million, in recent years, the BBC reported.

On Thursday, 140 world leaders signed an open letter calling for a vaccine to be universally available and not patented.

""Governments and international partners must unite around a global guarantee which ensures that, when a safe and effective vaccine is developed, it is produced rapidly at scale and made available for all people, in all countries, free of charge,"" the letter said.

Stefan de Keersmaecker, a spokesman for the European Commission, told Agence France-Presse: ""The vaccine against COVID-19 should be a global public good and its access needs to be equitable and universal.""

A Sanofi representative told Business Insider's Bryan Pietsch on Wednesday that the company was committed to making its vaccine ""accessible to everyone"" should it prove effective.

The person said partnering with BARDA allowed the company ""to initiate production as early as possible while we continue to develop and register the vaccine.""

Vaccines would be distributed in areas where they are produced, the person added.

Macron on Thursday said he expected a vaccine to be ready no earlier than winter 2021.",real
1395,https://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2020/05/youre_nonessential__keep_your_mouth_shut.html,2020-05-19,You're Nonessential -- Keep Your Mouth Shut,"COVID-19 America has realigned itself into a two-part caste system, one made up of the essential hero, and the other comprised of the selfish, nonessential coward. Essential heroes, like those who work in grocery stores, hospitals, Walmarts, and deliver for Amazon, are deserving of our admiration and praise. They risk their lives every day so we can have food, medical care, Egyptian bath towels, and cute panda knickknacks. And by “risk their lives,” I mean that if they are under the age of 60 and do not have an underlying medical condition, they may get a dry cough, runny nose, body aches, and be in bed for a week or so.

My wife is one of these essential workers. She’s a clinician at a small hospital in Philadelphia, where dozens of people have tested positive for COVID-19. In the middle of April she too tested positive, and subsequently gave the virus to me. Luckily, our symptoms were minor (she had a dry cough for a day, and I had lethargy and body aches for about a week), and we quickly recovered. When my wife returned to work after her 14-day quarantine, there was a big sign on the front lawn that read, Heroes Work Here. Although she was completely recovered and COVID-free, she still had to take a deep breath to keep from vomiting.

My wife was given special papers from her job to show she’s an essential worker, just in case she was out driving around and a cop pulled her over and demanded to know why she was on the road. I kid you not. When she showed me the letter I immediately thought of the movie Schindler’s List, where the one-armed man personally thanks Schindler for giving him a job as a machine operator. “Thank you for giving me the opportunity to work,” he says, shaking Schindler’s hand. “The SS beat me up. They would have killed me, but I’m essential to the war effort.”

Not that police are pulling people over for being out on the roads in Philadelphia. These hard-working individuals indeed have bigger fish to fry. But the fact that my wife is a healthcare worker does get her free coffee at Wawa, and a free “Thank You Meal” at McDonalds. That’s one of the perks of being an essential worker and being part of the hero class. You not only get free coffee and hamburgers, but you also have living-room concerts performed for you by Elton John. Oh, and you get access to cool things like your paycheck and health insurance, too.

Not everybody is an essential worker, of course. Not everybody is worthy of keeping their job and livelihood, their salary and benefits, their ability to provide for their family. Many people in America -- some 36 million and counting -- are nonessential workers. And these people -- just let me tell you -- the nerve of them. They actually want to count too! They actually want to be able to make a living? Ha! That’s funny. Our government, and all of our really smart scientists like Dr. Fauci, have already been through this a hundred times. Nonessential workers, and their means of making a living, are not important or “safe.” Their businesses, churches, goods and services, don’t count. Their physical and mental well-being, and that of their loved ones, must be sacrificed to allow the real heroes to carry on being heroes, and doing the difficult work of getting paid and supporting their families. It’s already been decided by the governors, like Gretchen Whitmer, and Gavin Newsom, and Tom Wolf, and Tony Evers.

It doesn’t matter if you spent your whole life building your business. Didn’t you get the memo? You’re nonessential. Stay inside with your mask on and keep your mouth shut. We need to keep our real heroes safe. Like the Twitter employees who can now work from home forever, and the Facebook fact checkers who risk their lives every day from their basement to censor information they find politically inconvenient, and the Walmart and Amazon people who supply all the really cool gadgets and entertainment stuff. These are the people who really count. These and all the brave politicians burning the midnight oil dreaming up new restrictions to violate our constitutional rights, or drafting policies to ensure the deaths of thousands of seniors in retirement homes. It’s these essential folks who deserve to get a regular paycheck. But you? Fuhgeddaboudit.

All you fake workers out there trying to survive and support your loved ones, just crawl back into your holes and stop being so selfish. Stop being so irresponsible. You don’t know about science, or about the dangers of buying seeds and paint, or about the war we’re fighting with this invisible enemy called COVID-19. Trying to hold a job during this time is selfish and cowardly, just ask Pennsylvania governor Tom Wolf, who’s a true hero. According to Penn Live:

Gov. Tom Wolf called out the Pennsylvania counties who declared they are moving to the yellow phase on their own, saying that funding will be withheld from these counties that don’t comply. “They need to understand the consequences of their cowardly act,” Wolf said of the county commissioners who had declared they will reopen. “They are engaging in behavior that is both selfish and unsafe,” he added.

Wolf is so caring and smart, and knows the difference between someone who’s essential and has the right to support his family, and someone who doesn’t. Wolf is a brave leader, and will crush any nonessential miscreant by threatening to withhold CARES Act funding from any business that dares try to reopen without his approval, even if they do so safely. He’ll also pull their health and liquor licenses, just for good measure, just in case they thought they could try to support their family without his approval. Wolf’s a great man, with a wise and noble administration. His Health Secretary, Dr. Rachel Levine (who was born Richard Levine), recently removed her 95-year-old mother from a nursing home amid a statewide coronavirus outbreak, despite the fact she supported a policy that forced care facilities to accept COVID-positive patients, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of seniors. That was a wise decision, though. It was equitable. If one elderly person must suffer and die from COVID-19, all elderly people must suffer and die. That’s collectivism at its core. That’s the Democrat party way.

As long as they are nonessential elderly, that is. Which Levine’s mother certainly wasn’t.

Kudos also goes out to Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti, the very wise and noble ruler who vowed to put those struggling citizens whose businesses were deemed “nonessential” in their place by cutting off their water and power. Way back in March, when there was still some life left in these rabble rousers, Garcetti knew he had to drop the hammer. According to a March 25th article in the Los Angeles Times, “Garcetti said his office was still receiving daily reports of nonessential businesses that continued to operate as normal -- behavior he called ‘irresponsible and selfish.’”

I mean, come on, people. Do these nonessential clowns really think they matter? Do they really think they are important enough to expect to get paid and support their families? Please. They need to get over themselves. They are not essential and not America’s heroes -- and will never be worthy of making a living, or of receiving free hamburgers at McDonalds.",fake
241,https://www.worldhealth.net/news/diy-face-masks/,2020-04-06,DIY Face Masks,"After weeks of saying that face masks aren’t needed for the general public, the CDC as well as others are now recommending that the general public wear face masks, in fact the Surgeon General has even offered instructions on how to make some at home given that supplies are long sold out and near impossible to find. ( links to videos at bottom of article)

“CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies) especially in areas of significant community-based transmission.”

Some suggest that using blue shop towels as insert filters to make DIY face masks can improve filtering particles 2-3 times better than cotton after three clothing designers tested dozens of fabrics. The masks that are currently circulating the internet really are not geared towards professional, industrial production, but this is a case of something being better than nothing. Even the CDC has told healthcare workers unable to obtain proper PPE to use a bandanna or a scarf as a last resort.

This recommendation to medical professionals may be alarming as there is no evidence of homemade masks protecting against the virus. ""While wearing a scarf or bandana might help prevent a sick person from transmitting coronavirus infection to others by trapping respiratory droplets, it is unsafe for healthcare workers to rely on scarves and bandanas to protect themselves against infection by their patients,"" says Celine Gounder, an epidemiologist and clinical assistant professor of medicine and infectious diseases at New York University.

In the recommendation even the CDC acknowledges that homemade PPE for the face still is not considered to be PPE noting that ""their capability to protect [healthcare professionals] is unknown. Caution should be exercised when considering this option,” and adds that ideally a full face shield should be used in combination with homemade masks.

The National Nurses United professional association and union pushed back against the loosening of PPE standards against the CDC suggesting that surgical masks could be worn instead of the more specialized N95 masks: ""If nurses and health care workers aren't protected, that means patients and the public are not protected,"" NNU executive director Bonnie Castillo said in a press release. ""This is a major public health crisis of unknown proportions. Now is not the time to be weakening our standards and protections, or cutting corners. Now is the time we should be stepping up our efforts.""

Amid the shortages health organizations are partnering with private companies and donors to help make more crucial medical equipment available. Grounder suggests that such collaboration may be critical to bridging gaps in needed supplies during this trying time. ""We are at war against the coronavirus,"" she said. ""In prior wars, we asked families to donate their wedding rings, jewelry, and other items to the war effort. We should be pleading with the public and corporations who are hoarding respirator masks to donate their N95 masks to those serving on the frontlines of this war.""

For most homemade face masks are the only option. It has been suggested that by adding two blue shop towels to a face mask design that is tighter fitting homemade masks could block up to 95% of the particles tested, while cotton masks only blocked 20-60%. These masks are not meant to replace N95 masks, but as an alternative when proper PPE is not available.

Chloe Schempf, Lindsay Medoff and Heather Pavlu of Suay Sew Shop have dusted off their sewing machine and are making about 200,000 masks or as many as they can before they run out of supplies of these masks with blue shop towels they suggest are more effective to give to those people who are working in the front lines risking it all, as well as raising money to get them properly tested to see if their design can be validated as a safer solution to cotton during the mask shortage.

Not to contradict CDC recommendations for a cloth masks but, ""We spent a few days researching and brainstorming any material that could filter: coffee filters, batting, window shades, Swiffer, interfacing, etc., all the way to more technical materials that are available to specialized industrial sectors like aviation, oil refinery, medical fields,"" Schempf said.

They tested many materials to find materials that breath as easily as cotton but filtered better. HEPA bags for instance filter great but are too suffocating to wear(and they contain fiberglass). Inserting two stretchy blue shop towels made from polyester hydro knit into an ordinary cotton mask was found to bring the filtration capacity up to 93% of particles as small as 0.3 microns which is the smallest size their machines can test for; cotton masks alone filtered up to 60% in their best test, according to Schempf. They also suggest that the masks held the 95% filtration for 3 machine washes.

""This is by community, for community,"" Medoff said. ""This is ordinary people taking their power back.""

Health experts still say that masks such as these are not likely to protect a healthy person from getting the virus, but if those that are infected with the virus and are not aware of it happen to be wearing a homemade mask while following social distancing it could help to minimize the spread.

The Surgeon General, Dr. Jerome Adams, has even released a video showing people how to make their own cloth face covering in a few easy steps using an old T-shirt and rubber bands after the CDC announcement. Amid the shortage besides bandannas, scarves, towels, and bedding, people can make their own using items from around the house, he explains in the recently released video.

“Remember this is all about me protecting you and you protecting me. And if people voluntarily choose to wear a face covering they're wearing it to protect their neighbors from getting coronavirus because they could have asymptomatic spread,” said Dr. Adams.

Here videos showing how to make a face mask, please note these are not to replace proper protective equipment, rather when nothing else is available:

264,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/business/economy/coronavirus-rent.html,2020-04-08,31% Can’t Pay the Rent: ‘It’s Only Going to Get Worse’,"
First it was the waitress whose restaurant closed. Then the waiter, the bartender, the substitute teacher, the hairdresser, the tattoo artist and the Walgreens manager.
One after the other, the tenants called and emailed their landlord, Bruce Brunner, to say they were out of work and the rent was going to be late. A week after the bill was due, some two dozen of Mr. Brunner’s 130 tenants had lost their jobs or had their hours reduced. He’s working out payment plans and using security deposits as a stopgap while directing tenants to the emerging patchwork of local, state and federal assistance programs.
“Six weeks ago, you could name your price and you’d have multiple people applying,” said Mr. Brunner, who lives in Minneapolis, where he owns and manages 20 duplexes and triplexes across the city. “Now you’re deferring and working out payment plans, and it’s only going to get worse.”
One week after the first of the month, tenants nationwide are already struggling with rents. In interviews with two dozen landlords — including companies with tens of thousands of units, nonprofit developers who house the working poor, and mom-and-pop operators living next door to their tenants — property owners say their collections have plunged as much of the economy has shut down to prevent the spread of the deadly coronavirus.
Daryl Carter, chief executive of Avanath Capital, a Southern California company with 10,000 units across the country, said his buildings reduced April rents by 10 percent. Deidre Schmidt, chief executive of CommonBond Communities, a nonprofit affordable-housing provider with about 6,000 apartments in the Midwest, expects as many as 40 percent of her tenants, most of them hourly workers with low incomes, to fall behind on their monthly bills. Joseph Razavian, a part-time landlord in Atlanta who works at a software company but owns a duplex and a triplex as investments, is bolstering his reserve fund by putting off nonessential maintenance like fresh paint and new rain gutters.
“The whole market just changed,” said Gustavo Lopez, a property manager in the San Francisco Bay Area.
Nearly 10 million people have filed unemployment claims over the past two weeks. It’s too early to gauge how broadly these numbers will translate to the loss of rent: Many tenants are within the grace period before their rent is declared late. Some can stitch things together for a while by getting deferrals, applying their security deposits or paying with credit cards.
Still, early findings suggest that April is looking bad and lend credence to Mr. Brunner’s opinion that May will be much worse. The National Multifamily Housing Council, a trade group for big apartment owners and developers, compiled data tracking rent payments across some 13.4 million units nationwide. It showed that through the first five days of April, 31 percent of tenants had so far failed to pay their rent, compared with 18 percent in the same period a year ago.
That lined up with surveys released by Apartment List, a rental listing service; Mynd Property Management; and Avail, a platform that helps small landlords manage rentals. All showed the share of partial or unpaid rent surging to as much as a quarter of billings, compared with March or last April.
Some tenants are simply moving out. College students are breaking leases to move home. Laid-off workers are showing up at rental offices to exchange their keys for their deposits, saying they are moving in with family members.
And there is Terra Thomas, a florist in Oakland, Calif., who could pay her April rent with savings if she wanted but has decided to withhold the $833 she pays for her studio. With her usually busy wedding season shaping up to be grim, she’d rather conserve her money than pay bills now.
“This could last a long time and be really, really serious, so I don’t want to be asking myself in a few months, ‘Why did I give away my last few paychecks to rent?’” she said. “I need to know that I can eat and pay for health care.”
The $2 trillion CARES Act, signed by President Trump on March 27, should in theory help laid-off tenants keep up with the rent through a combination of expanded unemployment insurance and one-time stimulus payments. The act also included aid to public-housing providers and grants to state governments that could be used for rental assistance.
But only a sliver of the money deals with housing directly. About $12 billion in grants will mostly be given to cities, homeless shelters, affordable-housing providers and states to support people who are homeless and sustain or increase housing assistance. There are big gaps in assistance for tenants as well as landlords, because almost all of it is directed to renters and owners already attached to some sort of government program.
For instance, much of the aid to tenants is earmarked for those living in subsidized and public housing, and much of the mortgage forbearance will benefit landlords whose loans are backed by the government through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac or the Department of Housing and Urban Development. This is little help to most moderate- and low-income tenants who live in market-rate developments, or small landlords whose loans are often held by private lenders and not backed by the federal government.
Cities and states have tried to address housing troubles by passing eviction moratoriums, which should prevent an immediate rise in homelessness but doesn’t resolve what happens in three or four months when tenants who have had little or no income are billed for months of back rent.
“Eventually the moratoriums will be lifted, and we don’t want to create an environment where low-income renters fall off a financial cliff and we have a rash of evictions,” said Diane Yentel, chief executive of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, an advocacy group in Washington.
After lobbying for grants to homeless providers in the CARES Act, her group is pushing for $100 billion in direct subsidies to tenants. The National Multifamily Housing Council has called for similar aid. Ms. Yentel, in an interview, cited two objectives: to relieve tenants of rent burden, but also to support small landlords at risk of foreclosure.
For several decades, the nation’s affordable-housing stock has fallen sharply, particularly “naturally occurring affordable housing” — run-down buildings that offer low rents without government subsidy. Since much of this housing is operated by smaller landlords, Ms. Yentel fears that without any aid to landlords, the buildings could go into default and be picked up by investors who will renovate them for higher-paying tenants after the crisis subsides.
“One way or the other, we have to get aid to smaller landlords so that the precious affordable-housing stock we have still exists on the other end of this crisis,” she said.
According to the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University, a quarter of the nation’s 44 million renter households paid more than half their income in rent in 2018. Separate research from the Federal Reserve showed four in 10 Americans would have difficulty covering a sudden $400 expense, suggesting that tens of millions of tenants are just a week of missed work away from falling behind on their housing bills.
For the past four years, rent increases have helped stir a nationwide tenant uprising that led to the biggest expansion of tenants’ rights in decades. Rent control laws were enacted in New York, Oregon and California, and tenants organized mass actions, like a group of mothers in Oakland who occupied an empty house for two months to protest house flipping.
Now, after years of coordination, organizers see the coronavirus pandemic as a galvanizing force. Last week, the Right to the City Alliance, a national coalition of tenant and racial-justice organizations, held a digital #CancelRent rally to call for rents to be eliminated as long as people can’t work. Homes Guarantee, a national tenants’ campaign, has been holding weekly strategy calls. On Wednesday, a caravan outside US Bank Plaza in Minneapolis honked horns and waved signs to demand rent and mortgage relief.
“This is a moment of clarity about a broken system in which 11 million people were already paying over 50 percent of their income on rent,” said Tara Raghuveer, a tenant organizer in Kansas City and director of Homes Guarantee.
Ms. Thomas, the renter refusing to pay in Oakland, is a member of the Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment, an activist group associated with the house-occupying mothers. For weeks she has been trying to organize her building in a rent strike, and has gotten tenants in three other units to join her.
One is her upstairs neighbor Andrew Yen, a data scientist at an agriculture company who still has a job and isn’t worried about making his $2,500 monthly rent. He and Ms. Thomas had been discussing some sort of coordinated action, but after weeks of job losses, and walking around his neighborhood seeing “rent strike” posted on telephone poles or spray-painted on utility boxes, he decided the time was now, so he is striking in solidarity.
“I feel like rent striking is the least somebody like me can do,” he said. “I’m the tenant the landlord wants to keep, so the worst-case scenario is eviction, but I probably have a lot more wiggle room than that.”",real
1682,https://www.dailynews.com/2020/05/21/la-supervisors-want-inspector-general-to-oversee-skilled-nursing-facilities-in-wake-of-covid-19/,2020-05-21,LA supervisors want inspector general to oversee skilled nursing facilities in wake of coronavirus,"LOS ANGELES — Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas and Board of Supervisors Chair Kathryn Barger will ask the board to appoint an inspector general to oversee skilled nursing facilities, which account for more than half of all deaths from COVID-19 in Los Angeles County.

The motion also calls for bringing in the county’s auditor-controller to ensure closer monitoring of skilled nursing facilities immediately. The inspector general would be tasked with developing recommendations on how to strengthen oversight for skilled nursing facilities, and how to improve their operations long-term, according to a statement.

Many skilled nursing homes get low marks for quality of care, patient satisfaction, and employee pay, the statement noted.

The Board of Supervisors will vote on the motion at their next meeting on Tuesday.

“While some skilled nursing homes may be doing their best to respond to COVID-19, we’ve seen hundreds of deaths at these facilities, tragically exposing the urgent need for stronger oversight across the industry,” Ridley-Thomas said. “Now, more than ever, we must act to address any questionable operations and substandard conditions in the facilities that care for some of our most vulnerable residents — the elderly, the low-income and the disabled.”

Barger added: “Skilled nursing facilities provide critical care and support for many of our most vulnerable populations. As the County fights the COVID-19 public health crisis, we must greatly improve our ability to assess and oversee these facilities to ensure the safety and well-being of all those who have been entrusted to their care.”

Skilled nursing facilities, which serve thousands of residents who tend to be older and medically fragile, have become the epicenter of L.A. County’s COVID-19 pandemic. As of May 18, 4,794 residents and 2,918 staff from these facilities have tested positive for the virus. Across L.A. County, 52 percent of all deaths from COVID-19 have been in institutional settings, particularly in skilled nursing facilities.

The L.A. County Department of Health Services director, Dr. Christina Ghaly, said that “It is our collective responsibility to protect and support the most vulnerable among us. Prioritizing the health and safety of those in our County’s skilled nursing facilities is the right thing to do and will also help protect the availability of hospital resources for all those who need them.”

The Ridley-Thomas/Barger motion says it is “critical that L.A. County learn the lessons of this crisis; identify the internal and external factors that have contributed to inadequate conditions within skilled nursing facilities; and provide oversight, accountability and resources as needed.”

They described the proposed inspector general as a ‘much-needed accountability measure” appointed to conduct an exhaustive review of L.A. County’s capacity to regulate skilled nursing facilities, recommend structural and operational changes, and outline a plan for ensuring adequate and sustainable oversight. They also plan to task the inspector general with recommending regulatory and policy improvements at the local, state and federal levels to enhance quality of care, ensuring adequate infection control measures, and supporting healthcare workers.

To increase transparency, the Ridley-Thomas/Barger motion also called for directing the L.A. County auditor-controller to take the lead in designing a publicly accessible dashboard with information about COVID-19 case totals, testing frequency, mitigation plan status, and other information. The motion seeks to find ways to enhance L.A. County’s ability to assess the adequacy of mitigation plans and to oversee their implementation.

Skilled nursing facilities have also received close attention from L.A. City government. Under an emergency order issued Friday by Mayor Eric Garcetti, skilled nursing facilities in Los Angeles will be required to provide diagnostic testing for COVID-19 for their employees, residents and contractors.

Nursing facilities, senior living homes and other facilities that care for people 65 and older have been potential “death traps,” Garcetti said.

Garcetti said the facilities can request assistance with testing from the city’s Emergency Operations Center if they’re unable to obtain it themselves. The tests will be required to be administered at least once a month.",real

The Dearborn Truck Plant, where Ford assembles the F-150 and Raptor pickups, halted production Wednesday after an employee there tested positive for the virus, Kelli Felker, Ford's global manufacturing and labor communications manager, said in a statement. Production is expected to resume Wednesday night.

Due to the known incubation time of the virus, Ford said ""we know (these employees) did not contract COVID-19 while at work.""

The cases illustrate the potential perils of restarting production amid the COVID-19 pandemic that has claimed more than 5,000 lives in Michigan. Autoworkers employed by Detroit's automakers returned to work Monday following an eight-week shutdown due to the coronavirus pandemic.

At facilities operated by all three companies, employees must follow stringent health and safety protocols that are designed to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 in plants. Those protocols include wearing personal protective equipment, having their temperatures checked before entering, and daily health self-certifications.

While COVID-19 testing is not available to the entire workforce of any of the automakers, all are making testing available to employees who are experiencing symptoms of the virus or who believe they have been exposed to it. Ford, for example, has contracts with health systems in major metro areas where it operates. In southeast Michigan, the Blue Oval is partnering with Beaumont Health on testing.

General Motors Co. and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV said Wednesday they have not been forced to stop production at their plants. Starting and stopping production is costly and something automakers would prefer to avoid — except for potential health and safety concerns.

Monday's resumption of production was the first time that the entire global automotive supply chain and major automakers all came back online at once, posing a major test to the industry. After a two-month shutdown in which the automakers bled billions of dollars, the goal has been to make the restart process as smooth as possible.

1138,http://sputniknews.com/columnists/202005161079322029-now-boris-beat-obesity/,2020-05-16,Now Boris Beat Obesity!,"Boris has declared the next front in his ‘war’ against Covid-19 is obesity and I’m backing him 100 percent.

The Prime Minister’s dice with death and time spent in intensive care has evidently changed his mind-set when it comes to intervening in public health. Like me, years ago, he saw initiatives like the sugar tax as part of the Nanny state and he was dead against it.

However, according to James Forsyth writing in the Times today Johnson’s had a major change of heart and it has been driven by the now undeniable link between coronavirus and obesity. He is convinced that the reason he ended up in intensive care was because of his weight.

This change of heart echoes what top cardiologist, Dr Aseem Malhotra has been campaigning about for years and it is urgent that the views of Aseem are now taken very seriously at the top of Government as there is no time to waste.

Pioneers like Aseem and Dr David Unwin have now proved that Type 2 diabetes is not an irreversible, lifelong chronic disease and that it can be tackled with lifestyle and diet changes, not more and more drugs.

Boris has come to the same conclusion as Aseem Malhotra that one of the main reasons why the UK has been so hard hit by Coronavirus is just how obese the UK population is. There is no denying that Obesity is the second biggest coronavirus risk factor, after age, and more than a quarter of Brits are obese.

Listen to the Experts

Aseem Malhotra’s was my guest on my sputnik radio show last week, listen here.

He explained that there's a very strong link between conditions like type two diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease and increasing death rates from COVID-19.

Aseem believes that our nations’ diet with its reliance on fast food and ultra-processed food is one of the major factors behind our obesity crisis and is strongly linked to a whole host of other diseases. He favours a move to a more Mediterranean style of diet and is a supporter of eating a low carbohydrate high fat diet.

He believes this style of eating can fundamentally change our health and is a believer that Type 2 diabetes can be reversed in this manner.

He told me in last week’s show that “current NHS guidelines haven't caught up with the science. What I would say though, interestingly, is new evidence suggests for Type 2 diabetes, specifically, that a low carbohydrate diet is a safe and effective option, but the problem is, it's not well publicized.""

Dr Malhotra stunned me when he also stated that the public aren't aware that the present dietary guidance is not independently formulated and companies like Coca Cola, Kellogg's, Pepsi, McDonald's, amongst many others directly influence the guidance. He says ""they are not there to look after your health, they're certainly not there to protect you from getting Type 2 diabetes or obesity, in fact, the opposite in a way because they want to make money by selling you more food. The question is, why are they involved in making up what's supposed to be independent guidance? And that for me that is the real scandal.""

Big Sugar Fake

This is a point that has been taken up today on Twitter by former Tory Minister, David Davies who tweeted, ‘Good to see Boris taking obesity seriously now. But he had better be sure the science behind any policy is right. Quite a lot of evidence that all Western governments have based guidance on bad science for 50 years. We must review the science first, then act.’

He is correct that thee science is not only outdated but it was fake from day one and funded by the sugar industry.

Effectively in the 1960’s the sugar industry paid scientists to play down the link between sugar and heart disease and instead to promote the idea that saturated fat was the driver of heart disease.

This fake news or “science” then shaped five decades of nutritional advice and dietary recommendations. In other words, Big Sugar controlled the agenda and many say they still do!

Look at the Evidence

It was also good to see Labour’s ex Deputy Leader, Tom Watson give his support too by tweeting, ‘David is right on this, we need independently funded nutritional science. There’s so much more we can do to unify the nation on this agenda.’

The thing that unites these two political heavyweights is the fact that both lost tons of weight (8 stone in Watson’s case) by following a low carbohydrate high fat diet combined with gentle exercise.

According to the Times' article today Boris favours getting everyone on a bike to promote fitness and weight loss but he should heed the wise words of Professor Tim Noakes of the University of Johannesburg who states unequivocally that you cannot out run (or out cycle) a bad diet. Its’ what we eat that is the primary driver of obesity.

If Boris is still not convinced he should have a word with his health secretary, Matt Hancock, who declared at the World Economic Forum in China on September 19 2018 that he had lost 2 stone in 3 months by cutting out carbs from his diet.

He said, ""It is clear that obesity is one of the rising challenges for the health of the nation, the links between obesity, diabetes and to cancer are increasingly clear.”

“We need to ensure that people don’t always reach to the medicinal solution. Losing weight, activity and eating better are there of the best things that you can do to tackle obesity.” He also praised Tom Watson calling him “an example to many.”

If Boris wants more evidence he could always give me a call, as I too have reversed my Type 2 diabetes, got my blood pressure into the normal range and solved a myriad of other health issues by adopting a low carb high fat lifestyle combined with gentle walking.

I was a type 2 diabetic for 15 years, weighing in at the best part of 22 stone and on at least ten tablets a day.

Stop Dietary Genocide

I’m not alone as people all around the globe are doing it for themselves but still the dietary guidelines push the concept of the Eatwell plate and tell us to eat starchy carbs. It is sugar and starchy carbs (which turn to glucose) that is the enemy, not fat.

Obesity is not just costing lives it is also costing the NHS billions and many experts believe if Type 2 cases continue to rise it could effectively bankrupt the NHS.

At the moment the Annual spend on the treatment of obesity and diabetes is greater than the amount spent on the police, the fire service and the judicial system combined.

Type 2 diabetes and obesity is killing more people than Covid19 and Professor Tim Noakes has even gone so far as to describe the present dietary guidelines as a “genocide.”

Covid-19 caught us unaware and unprepared but there is no need for Type 2 diabetes and Obesity to do the same. We know the problem and we know the fix. Boris let’s get it done now. Let’s change the dietary guidelines now.

This one can gobble like Pac-Man,"OR YEHUDA, Israel (Reuters) - Israeli inventors have developed a coronavirus mask with a remote control mouth that lets diners eat food without taking it off, a device they say could make a visit to a restaurant less risky.

A squeeze of a lever, much like a cyclist operates a handbrake, opens a slot in the front of the mask so that food can pass through.

The process could get messy with ice cream or sauces, but more solid morsels can be gobbled up in a flash a la Pac-Man in the arcade game.

“The mask will be opened mechanically by hand remote or automatically when the fork is coming to the mask,” Asaf Gitelis, vice president of Avtipus Patents and Inventions, said on Monday as he demonstrated the device at its offices near Tel Aviv.

“Then you can eat, enjoy, drink and you take out the fork and it will be closed, and you’re protected against the virus and other people sitting with you.”

The company said it plans to start manufacturing the mask within months and had already submitted a patent. It said it would likely sell at a 3 to 10 shekel ($0.85 to $2.85) premium above the price of the simple pale blue medical masks many Israelis wear.

Outside a Juice Bar in Tel Aviv, Reuters showed customers a cellphone video of the mask in action. Opinion was divided.

“I think this mask, that enables me to eat while I’m still wearing it, is a must-have,” said Ofir Hameiri, a 32-year-old graduate student.

But eating an ice cream cone, Ron Silberstein, a 29-year-old musician, said: “I don’t think this mask could hold this kind of ice cream - it’s dripping all over. I wouldn’t want to wear it afterward.”

Israel has largely reopened its economy after a dramatic drop in cases of the novel coronavirus. Restaurants are open only for takeout for the time being.

1383,https://amgreatness.com/2020/05/19/we-were-never-asked/,2020-05-19,We Were Never Asked,"Common sense and the interests of the common people are increasingly opposed to the managerial class, whether in business or government.

Police officers dealing with the public have a fairly savvy approach to persuasion: first ask, then tell, then force. It works because it accounts for the dignity and self-respect of others. Uncertain rookie cops and bullies are the ones who forget to ask, adding unnecessary friction to encounters between citizens and the state.

In the early days of the coronavirus, everyone went from being carefree and complacent to scared in the blink of an eye. We did not know what we were facing, other nations were taking extreme measures, and apocalyptic predictions from scientists and public health officials created an overnight panic.

Quite voluntarily, most people avoided crowds, unnecessary trips to the store, going to the office, and anything that might increase their risk of catching the coronavirus. Handshakes went out of style, as did restaurants, gyms, and travel. Soon there was a run on surgical masks, which became so bad that authorities engaged in a “noble lie” to discourage their use by regular folks. Now these same experts have reversed course, as if we will forget what they said only a month ago.

We Were Sold a Temporary Lockdown

In addition to these voluntary measures, mandatory lockdown measures were imposed to “flatten the curve.” They were supposed to save our hospitals and preserve limited ventilator resources. While severe, this mostly made sense, as the risk seemed enormous, and the lockdowns were sold as a temporary measure.

As soon as the “15 days to slow the spread” began to expire, however, the goalposts were moved. New reasons to keep them in place were proffered, including inadequate testing and the fact that the virus was so widespread.

After two months with little human contact, tens of millions of lost jobs, and far fewer hospitalizations and deaths from the coronavirus than the experts predicted, many have concluded that these lockdown measures were a mistake. Even if they were once justifiable based on limited information, more and more people are convinced that continuing these measures any longer will be worse than the risks from the disease itself.

The Natives are Restless

Even as some states have started to open, leaders in mostly blue states and urban areas have held fast. These new measures border on the sadistic.

Mandatory mask orders have appeared in many locales. In Los Angeles, which has been only moderately affected by the coronavirus, the lockdown has extended through the end of July. Illinois’ governor, J.B. Pritzker, decreed that only two passengers would be permitted on recreational boats, regardless of size and whether everyone aboard lives in the same household. Michigan’s Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer, said her state’s harsh and ongoing restrictions were based “on the best science, the best facts.”

Skepticism and annoyance are now bubbling into anger and active resistance. Protesters in Michigan have taken to carrying guns and making vague threats against their governor, who has taken a particularly hard line against all normal human activity.

In Fresno, California, demonstrators actively confronted the mayor and a city councilman at their homes. In Dallas, the authorities tried to make an example of a hairdresser who reopened her salon. Far from acting “selfish,” she explained how her employees needed to make a living and were suffering.

As it has with the issue of global warming, the “science vs. skeptic” debate has become partisan. About half the country, maybe more, simply do not trust the experts. They don’t trust them on the facts, not least because they are consistently proven wrong by events, but they also don’t trust their motives or concern for the people they are hurting. The common people especially resent how, instead of persuasion, the experts are so quick to reach for the mandate.

An Aloof Managerial Elite

Last year, through an excellent HBO miniseries, the Soviet Union’s 1986 Chernobyl disaster came to life. Lies about risk were widespread. People were told for years that science proved the reactors were safe, only to be dragged from their radiation-contaminated homes with only the clothes on their back. Certain observers, particularly on the Right, saw the series as a lesson in the evils of communism. While it was indeed that, things also looked rather familiar.

Like our country today, the Soviet Union was full of hard-working and patriotic little people, whose lives and fates were controlled by authorities more concerned with saving face than doing the right thing. As the series dramatized, individualized justice and truth were often suppressed in the name of ideology and scientific progress. Rank and title counted for a lot, while common sense was often neglected. The Soviet Union was a Communist regime, but it was chiefly a bureaucratic regime, where the bureaucracy’s managerial class had privileged lives and a hostile relationship to the common people.

The United States has long been a more individualistic, entrepreneurial, and freedom-loving people than those in Europe, whether East or West. Our national life is much more than an abstract creed. Our culture can be found as much in the Federalist Papers as in the advent of the road trip, music festivals, and, in the days of Prohibition, the speak-easy. We are a restless, energetic, and unbridled people. We are wont to question authority and bend rules that seem stupid and meddlesome.

Public health has always had an uneasy relationship with that culture. At its worst, public health expresses a censorious, cautious, and schoolmarm instinct. It is the force behind book-length warnings on the side of lawnmowers, the demise of dodgeball, and Prohibition itself. If it is an American impulse, it’s the dark side of America; the perversion of our “can do” spirit into relentless crusades against fun in the name of safety and science.

We all have our own priorities, weigh risks and benefits differently, and, until recently, were allowed to decide these things for ourselves. The public health ideologue does not agree that risks of various kinds—including the voluntary risks of smoking, drinking alcohol, or driving motorcycles—are things that a free people should be allowed to do.

People Can Assess Risk for Themselves

The lockdown crowd will invoke a countervailing principle: even people who believe in freedom will concede that you do not have the right to endanger others.

In the abstract, this is true. But is anyone endangering others if they fail to abide by these lockdowns? Setting aside the modest coronavirus risk for the vast majority of people, we have been told that social distancing is the means of safety. If you avoid others, wash your hands, and wear a mask, you will be safe.

If avoiding others, wearing masks, and social distancing are so effective, then—like refraining from smoking or skydiving—the people who feel strongly about risk have the means of protecting themselves. Perhaps vulnerable populations are well-served to follow these precautions. Just as people can choose not to get on a motorcycle, the vulnerable and cautious can engage in voluntary masking and social distancing.

The risks and benefits of living normally can be borne by those who want to live.

No one likes to be told what to do, whether by a bully cop or a bully doctor in a white lab coat. This is especially so when the people doing the telling have done so in the form of arbitrary decrees after mayors and governors have handed over the keys to their public health experts.

No one elected Anthony Fauci or the freakishly unhealthy-looking public health commissars in Los Angeles and Pennsylvania. No one asked us if we would endure universal masking or indefinite shutdowns on their say so. And, to the extent we were asked to give our consent for any of this, our consent for a lockdown was procured using false pretenses about its necessity, duration, and severity.

By channeling the frustration and skepticism of the general public, Donald Trump has become the tribune of the people. While there is no obvious reason these issues should fall ideologically the way they do, this is the key to understanding our changing politics. Common sense and the interests of the common people are increasingly opposed to the managerial class, whether in business or government. The next election is evolving into a referendum on managerial expertise. A choice between sterile safety secured by expert rule, or common sense and freedom.

In other words, while the virus may be a unique and novel threat, the next election—like the one in 2016—will fundamentally be one about who we are. We have the chance to affirm that we are the same nation that one reads about in history books, a nation of Americans defined by their love of freedom.",fake
1910,https://theduran.com/like-post-war-britain-we-need-a-new-normal-after-covid-19/,2020-05-23,"Like post-war Britain, we need a new normal after Covid-19","Submitted by InfoBrics, authored by Johanna Ross, journalist based in Edinburgh, Scotland…

As lockdown restrictions begin to be lifted, and we slowly aim to return to ‘normality’, questions are beginning to be asked about just what that normality should be. For never in recent history has a crisis so blatantly highlighted the inequalities in our society. And it’s not just those on the left that think so. Veteran right-wing journalist Max Hastings, recently wrote a piece in which he said the coronavirus pandemic unleashed a demand for ‘social, political and economic reform unprecedented in our memories’. Even the former governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, recently admitted that when this is over, it would be ‘reasonable’ for people to ‘demand improvements’ in the quality of social provision and healthcare.

The reality is that Covid-19 has turned capitalists into socialists overnight, whether they like it or not. We’ve kept hearing about governments making the choice between people and the economy. But people are the economy. Fundamentally, we need a change in priorities. The danger is that we return to a status quo from which another crisis will be born: this pandemic is not over yet, the threat of another one in future is real, and we need to have the social measures in place to enable us to deal with the fallout. Britain only has to compare itself statistically with other nations to realize that, along with the US, it has suffered particularly badly so far from this disease, and we have to ask why. An under-funded healthcare system, together with a 20% poverty rate surely plays a role.

In the midst of this ‘war’, with unemployment set to skyrocket, and families struggling to pay the rent and feed their children, Jeremy Corbyn’s agenda at the last election looks appealing. The renationalisation of key industries, a ‘living’ wage, a massive social housing programme, and immediate pay rise for public sector workers; somehow it doesn’t seem so ‘radical’ after all. The latest figures show that people living in poorer areas in Britain are twice as likely to succumb to coronavirus. What is the government doing about it? Not much. One of the Tory pledges in their 2019 election manifesto was to add five years on to life expectancy by 2035. But that’s a tall order and would mean a significant change in policies – not just in the short term for dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic – but in the long term. We may be the world’s fifth largest economy but Britain is currently ranked 29th in the global life expectancy index, behind a host of European countries.

The question is, what kind of post-Covid-19 future do we want? Already comparisons are being made with the aftermath of the Depression and the Second World War. After the Depression, President Roosevelt stated that ‘heedless self-interest is…bad economics’ and that ‘freedom from want’ must be a key factor in policy-making. As for the UK, war-time leader Winston Churchill’s Conservative party was rejected in the 1945 election in favour of Labour, whose manifesto brandished the slogan ‘The Labour party is a Socialist party and proud of it’. The policies on which the party won were radical: nationalisation of the Bank of England, the coal and energy industries, public transport, and iron and steel. During the war, inequality was laid bare much in the same way as it has been during this current pandemic, and we saw the 1942 Beveridge report published, which laid the foundation for the welfare state – the cornerstone of British society as we know it today.

‘Goodbye globalisation’ read the front cover of this week’s Economist. It argues that globalisation was already on the rocks after the 2008 financial crash and Trump’s war with China; Covid-19 has been the final nail in the coffin. It predicts that global trade faces a troubling time ahead as governments, forced to underwrite national firms, will continue to favour them moving forward. But this can only be welcomed. Firstly, global trade generally means rich countries exploiting cheap workers abroad. Aside from welfare, a return to ‘normality’ would be disastrous for the planet. Satellite images have shown the remarkable changes which have taken place in our atmosphere across the globe as lockdowns were imposed on an international scale. Carbon dioxide emissions are set to have fallen this year by 8%, but this would have to occur every year for a decade in order to limit global warming to less than 1.5C above pre-industrial temperatures.

Obviously, repeated and prolonged lockdown is not a solution, but some serious attempt must be made to address climate change before it’s too late. The coronavirus pandemic illustrates just how mother nature can floor us before we know it. She can’t be underestimated. Indeed there has been something wonderful about the way nature has been able to reclaim its territory in this short time, with social media packed with viral videos of wild animals roaming the empty streets of our metropolises without a care in the world. It could be imagination, but somehow even the trees and bushes seem more green and luscious at this time.

So while governments take their first steps back towards ‘normality’, it’s vital that, as a race, we don’t. This is a pivotal moment in our history, when the world is on pause, that we can think about what kind of future we want for our grandchildren, instead of being completely at the mercy of business, blindly bashing on, maximizing profit at whatever the cost. As William Beveridge proclaimed back in 1942 “A revolutionary moment in the world’s history is a time for revolutions, not for patching.’

The report, produced by Swiss company IQAir, pulls together government data from Delhi, London, Los Angeles, Milan, Mumbai, New York City, São Paulo, Seoul, Wuhan, and Rome.

Places typically choked with worse air pollution saw the most extreme drops

Places typically choked with worse air pollution saw the most extreme drops in fine particulate matter, or soot. Delhi saw a 60 percent reduction in pollution over a three-week period while its stay-at-home order took effect, compared to the same period last year. Seoul, South Korea, saw a 54 percent decrease. Soot in Wuhan, China, dropped by 44 percent.

IQAir manufactures air purifiers and pollution monitors but also maintains online air quality maps. An interactive real-time map — a collaboration between IQAir and United Nations environmental and sustainability programs — provides information about the air quality index across major cities, along with a ranking of where air pollution is worst.

The data backs up previous observations of how the air has cleared up during the pandemic as nonessential businesses shut down and planes, trains, and cars emptied. NASA shared maps in early March depicting a dramatic drop in China of another pollutant pumped out by tailpipes that inflames airways, nitrogen dioxide. NASA similarly saw a 30 percent reduction in nitrogen dioxide emissions over the Northeast United States in March.

Rome was the only one of the 10 cities that actually saw an increase in soot over the three-week period. More people using their heating systems at home could be one culprit for poorer air quality, according to the report.

Cleaner air is a welcome reprieve during a pandemic caused by a virus that affects the lungs, but it’s not forecast to last. Air pollution is expected to rebound after restrictions set during the pandemic loosen. Similar rebounds have been observed with air quality and greenhouse gas emissions after other economic shocks like the 2008 recession.",real
891,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/officials-release-edited-coronavirus-reopening-guidance,2020-05-14,Officials release edited coronavirus reopening guidance,"NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. health officials on Thursday released some of their long-delayed guidance that schools, businesses and other organizations can use as states reopen from coronavirus shutdowns.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention posted six one-page “decision tool” documents that use traffic signs and other graphics to tell organizations what they should consider before reopening.

The tools are for schools, workplaces, camps, childcare centers, mass transit systems, and bars and restaurants. The CDC originally also authored a document for churches and other religious facilities, but that wasn’t posted Thursday. The agency declined to say why.

Early versions of the documents included detailed information for churches wanting to restart in-person services, with suggestions including maintaining distance between parishioners and limiting the size of gatherings. The faith-related guidance was taken out after the White House raised concerns about the recommended restrictions, according to government emails obtained by the AP and a person inside the agency who didn’t have permission to talk with reporters and spoke on condition of anonymity.

On Thursday, a Trump administration official also speaking on condition of anonymity said there were concerns about the propriety of the government making specific dictates to places of worship.

President Donald Trump has championed religious freedom as a way to connect with conservative evangelical voters and has shown eagerness for in-person religious services to restart. He consulted interfaith leaders last month for suggestions on how to reopen and said on a recent Fox News town hall that “we have to get our people back to churches, and we’re going to start doing it soon.”

The CDC drafted the reopening guidance more than a month ago and it was initially shelved by the administration, The Associated Press reported last week.

The agency also had prepared even more extensive guidance — about 57 pages of it — that has not been posted.

That longer document, which the AP obtained, would give different organizations specifics about how to reopen while still limiting spread of the virus, including by spacing workers or students 6 feet apart and closing break rooms and cafeterias to limit gatherings. Many of the suggestions already appear on federal websites but they haven’t been presented as reopening advice.

Some health experts and politicians have been pushing for the CDC to release as much guidance as possible to help businesses and organizations decide how to proceed.

“They want to be able to tell their own employees the guidance of the federal government,” Dr. Tom Inglesby, director of the Center for Health Security at Johns Hopkins University, said at a congressional hearing Wednesday. “They want to be able to tell their customers, ‘We’ve done everything that’s been asked of us.’”

The guidance relates to another document released by the Trump administration on April 17. That phased-in reopening plan broadly outlines how to move away from stay-at-home orders, school closures and other measures designed to stop the spread of the new coronavirus that has caused more than 1.3 million reported U.S. illnesses and more than 80,000 deaths.

U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat, on Wednesday offered a resolution — blocked by Republicans — to encourage release of all the documents.

“America needs and must have the candid guidance of our best scientists unfiltered, unedited, uncensored by president Trump or his political minions. The CDC report on reopening the country is an important piece of that guidance,” Schumer said.

The decision tools have been undergoing review by different federal officials, and they’ve been edited from earlier versions.

For example, an earlier draft of the one-page document on camps obtained by the AP asked organizers if their program would limit attendance to people who live nearby. If the answer was no, the camp was advised not to reopen. That local attendance limitation was dropped and was not in the version posted Thursday.

And in that document and others, language has been dropped that asked if the organization is in a community that is still requiring significant disease mitigation. If the answer was yes, the organization was advised not to reopen.

Many of the changes provide more wiggle room than what was in the initial versions.

For example, in the document for people who run child care centers, the older version obtained by the AP stated that CDC recommended “checking for signs and symptoms of children and staff.” The new guidelines add “as feasible” to the end.

Similar new language about feasibility appears in sections about promoting healthy hygiene such as hand washing and employees wearing cloth masks.

Opinion contributor

My son defended his doctoral dissertation virtually this spring, from an apartment where he lives alone, 3,123 miles away from me. In normal times, one of his mentors would have brought a bottle of good champagne to toast the newly-minted Professor Clayton. In normal times, I’d have a ticket for a seat beside his 87-year-old grandfather on a six-hour flight to applaud the short moment of Chris walking across a stage in crimson silk gown and black-and-crimson hood, with the white crow's-feet emblem of an arts and sciences guy, an economist.

Instead, we’re looking for an alternative way to honor six years of incredibly hard work. I’m caught without the eggs and chocolate even to make his favorite flourless chocolate cake. I’m seeking advice by tweet about what that shop where he buys Thanksgiving pies might be, and whether they could deliver to his door in time for the box to be quarantined, or whether disinfecting it with bleach spray is good enough.

We've lost our traditions

Ceremony. Merriam Webster defines it as “a formal act or series of acts prescribed by ritual, protocol, or convention.” But what do you do when a pandemic makes ritual, protocol, and convention impossible? “Celebrate” is “to perform (a sacrament or solemn ceremony) publicly and with appropriate rites.” Publicly.

It feels indulgent, to grieve such a small loss. My family remains alive and uninfected. We are not saying that last goodbye by phone to a loved one dying in a hospital room without our hand to hold. We are not postponing that ultimate of ceremonies, the funeral. We are not having to bear that ultimate of griefs alone.

The loss of ceremony is not even the hardest thing my son has had to endure in his relatively short life. Not even close. And he starts his dream job at a university July 1. He won’t even suffer a health insurance gap.

And yet I cry in the shower, as do, I suppose, millions of us all over the world. We grieve the chance to celebrate those we love in what used to be the big moments in life, in the time before every moment of life itself seemed so very big. Moments that, all over the world, and for all of human history, have been marked by ceremony.

Pandemic life:We're slouching toward graduation at home with our college senior

No flipping of tassels or tossing of graduation caps this May and June. Not for college students or law students or Ph.D.s. Not for high schools. Not for middle schools or preschools. Not for medical students, many of whom are already out working in the fight to defeat this virus. Even the U.S. Naval Academy, where the hat-tossing tradition began in 1912, tossed theirs this year without the benefit of an audience to applaud.

No dancing at weddings or comic stuffing of cake bites into newlywed mouths. No babies crying over baptismal fonts. No awkward student welcomes and get-to-know-yous over the summer. Birthdays. Anniversaries. Publication parties. Film premieres. Retirements. Not even a Mother’s Day brunch for most of us.

Easter teleconference to meet a baby

This spring, there will be none of those moments we photograph and paste into scrap books, share with our virtual friends, and set out in frames for years to come.

So we adapt, of course. My niece introduces her new daughter into the family by Easter teleconference. My nephew considers delaying a fall wedding until we can all gather again. Zoom becomes a verb with a new meaning, and we have never been so grateful to be living in the time of video technology that was the stuff of television-show fiction when many of us were growing up.

HOTLINE:Share your coronavirus story

My son, like so many graduates this year, will attend a virtual commencement and a “special online event” for some smaller group of Ph.D. candidates or economists, the details of which are being worked out now.

He will also be feted in person “sometime later, once we know it is safe to bring people together again,” his university president assures us. That celebration will come with “all of the pomp, circumstance, and tradition that is typical” of their commencements, and “as many of the traditional campus festivities that typically precede commencement as possible.”

We need a Coronavirus Service Corps:It will help America and our vulnerable young people

We will be there whenever we can be, and we will applaud all the more enthusiastically for having endured this moment and come out on the other side. We hope we will, anyway. We are staying indoors, and living without eggs if they can’t be delivered to us, and recognizing the privilege we have to be able to stay inside, stay well, and endure only these small griefs.

And, yes, we cry in the shower. But we also appreciate these pivotal life moments even more somehow, for having to experience them virtually, or to look forward to the time when “celebrate” is once again a present-tense verb.

On this episode of The Critical Hour, Dr. Wilmer Leon is joined by Caleb Maupin, journalist and political analyst who focuses his coverage on US foreign policy.

It's Friday: that means it's panel time!

""The US State Department has approved a possible sale to Taiwan of 18 MK-48 Mod6 advanced technology heavyweight torpedoes and related equipment for an estimated cost of $180 million, the US Defense Security Cooperation Agency said in a statement on Wednesday,"" Reuters reported Wednesday. What will happen next as tensions rise with China?

Venezuela and Iran, two countries that the US has decided to make adversaries, and which have been ""stung by sanctions and hobbled by the coronavirus, are forging a closer strategic partnership, providing embattled President Nicolás Maduro a vital lifeline and offering Tehran the prospect of a new center of influence just across the Caribbean Sea from Florida,"" the Washington Post reported Friday. ""The most public display of the deepening relationship: five oil tankers now steaming across the Atlantic Ocean to Venezuela, carrying what analysts estimate to be 60 million gallons of Iranian gasoline ... The first of the ships is set to arrive in Venezuelan waters as soon as this weekend, to relieve fuel shortages so dire that the sick can’t get to hospitals and produce is rotting on farms."" How will the US react to this as the ships get closer to Venezuela?

US President Donald Trump continues to attack China for what he describes as ""worldwide killing"" from COVID-19. This message is likely to be relevant in the 2020 US presidential campaign. ""The White House salvos have sought to keep a focus on China's early response to the virus and what Trump has called a 'China-centric' deference at the World Health Organization. China, in turn, has portrayed itself as a good global citizen willing to work with the United Nations and other countries to defeat the pandemic,"" the Washington Post reported Thursday.

In David Lindorff's recent piece for RT, titled ""COVID-19 is massacring US elderly in nursing homes, neglected for years by a power-hungry industry,"" he states, ""The elderly in US care institutions are dying disproportionately from COVID-19. The pandemic has revealed the extent to which their wellbeing and safety have been sacrificed by an industry that prioritizes profit and influence.” How is this happening?

""America’s billionaires have seen their wealth increase by 12.5 percent during the COVID-19 lockdown period. The Institute for Policy Studies (IPS), a Washington, DC-based think tank, released a study Thursday showing that, in the eight weeks between March 18 and May 14, the country’s super-wealthy have added a further $368.8 billion to their already enormous fortunes,"" Alan MacLeod wrote in a May 15 MintPress News article. All this comes at the same time that the economy has undeniably imploded for working people. MacLeod's article continues: ""A record 36 million Americans have filed for unemployment insurance, with millions more losing their employer-based health care plans, and around a third of the country not paying its rent. Schools, factories, offices, and other businesses remain shuttered. The Trump administration has promised to provide $1,200 to every citizen, but it will be months before everyone receives their check. As a result, there has been an explosion in the use of food banks, as desperate citizens line up for hours in the hopes of receiving a box of food.""

""The US has rejected wording in a World Health Organization resolution that backs the right of poor countries to ignore patents in order to gain access to a COVID-19 vaccine or treatment,"" the Financial Times reported this week. ""Washington dissociated itself Tuesday from elements of a motion passed by WHO members, saying that it sent 'the wrong message to innovators who will be essential to the solutions the whole world needs.' Many governments, particularly in Africa, fear they will be squeezed out by richer countries unless they can force companies that discover anti-COVID-19 therapies to share their intellectual property with manufacturers able to produce them cheaply at scale.""

The partnership lets qualified Bandsintown artists bypass the normal qualifications needed to become a Twitch Affiliate and get fast access to the live streaming platform’s monetization tools.

Canceled events are a blow to musicians who depend on income from live shows, and many have turned to “quaranstreams” to try and alleviate the financial damage. SoundCloud recently announced a similar initiative with Twitch.

Bandsintown artists with 2,000 trackers or more are eligible to apply. You’ll then have to create a Twitch channel, link it on your artist profile on the platform, and fill out a short form. (It’s linked in Bandsintown’s post.) Once submitted, the company says Twitch’s Affiliation program will contact you by email within two to five business days to get any other details needed to upgrade your account.

with tours canceled, many musicians have started “quaranstreams”

Affiliate status on Twitch unlocks monetization tools, like subscriptions and the ability to receive tips. Getting fast Affiliate approval can help out artists who need to create additional income now, with swaths of the entertainment industry ground to a halt as a result of the pandemic.

Normally, in order to qualify for Affiliate status, a Twitch user must have at least 50 followers along with at least 500 total broadcast minutes in the last 30 days, seven unique broadcast days in the last 30 days, and an average of three concurrent viewers or more in the last 30 days. This program, like the one between Twitch and SoundCloud, lets artists bypass these hurdles so they can monetize on Twitch within days.

”Twitch continues to be a great place for artists to perform and connect with their fans live,” said Mike Olson, Twitch’s head of music, said in a statement. “We’re excited to partner with Bandsintown to provide artists not only the best live streaming experience, but an opportunity for our community to support them with monetization tools that aren’t offered elsewhere.”

Bandsintown also recently launched its own Twitch channel and added the ability to push out a “watch live” notification when musicians are live-streaming shows. These notifications will show up on Bandsintown, as well as Facebook pages and anywhere else Bandsintown listings appear.",real

The media mogul on Tuesday announced “Oprah’s Your Life in Focus: A Vision Forward — Live Virtual Experience,” a free and interactive four-week event that is an extension of her wellness tour with WW (Weight Watchers Reimagined). The 90-minute experiences, hosted by Winfrey via Zoom, will air at 10 a.m. Saturdays from May 16 through June 6.

The numbers that tell the story: Our coronavirus data tracking On our Coronavirus Data page, you’ll find a collection of graphs, charts and maps tracing the spread of the virus, tracking test results and plotting the impact on individual counties. Check back daily for updated totals.

“In early 2020, I spent nine weeks traveling the country, talking to people about being well and staying focused. It was exhilarating. Then the pandemic hit and shook us all,” Winfrey said in a statement. “Now, it’s more important than ever to be and stay well and strong. Together, let’s reset, refocus and find clarity in what matters most.”

Winfrey’s tour, “Oprah’s 2020 Vision: Your Life in Focus,” launched earlier this year and visited arenas like Brooklyn’s Barclays Center and The Forum in Inglewood, California. The tour included one-on-one conversations with Michelle Obama, Dwayne Johnson, Lady Gaga and other stars.

During the four-week virtual experiences, Winfrey will tackle topics like self-care during the pandemic, connecting in relationships while social distancing, committing to a healthy lifestyle and more.

Get ready to wait.,"© HEATHER KHALIFA/The Philadelphia Inquirer/TNS Volunteers grab absentee ballot applications to stuff into food boxes distributed by the city, school district, and nonprofit groups in Philadelphia on May 16, 2020.

It’s a familiar election night routine: Polls close, and everyone wants to know who won — immediately. Every minute matters for Americans anxiously awaiting the results. News organizations race to meet the demand by using complex statistical models to “call"" the winner long before all the votes are counted.

But get comfortable waiting: Instant electoral gratification is about to become a thing of the past.

A new Pennsylvania law that allows any voter to cast a ballot by mail, along with a surge in requests for mail-in ballots driven by fears of voting in person during the coronavirus pandemic, has set up a 2020 election in which everyone could be left waiting for days before results are known.

That might not bother the public much when it comes to the June 2 primary, with a Democratic presidential contest that has already been effectively decided. But when President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden face off in the fall, and all eyes turn to the critical swing state of Pennsylvania, delays could effectively leave the race for the White House in limbo for days.

“If nothing changes before November, I would bet my house there would be no way anybody could responsibly call the presidential race [on election night],” said Forrest Lehman, elections director for Lycoming County, in central Pennsylvania.

The new law, which also changes how and when mail-in votes are counted, already stood to wreak havoc on the public’s expectation for quick results.

“No county wants to be the reason we don’t know the leader of the free world on election night,” Lee Soltysiak, Montgomery County’s chief operating officer and clerk of its election board, said in January. “And that’s the position, depending on the margin, we’re all likely to be in.”

Read our January story: Pennsylvania’s presidential election could be too close to call for days because of a new lawThen the coronavirus hit. The number of polling places are being cut. Requests for mail ballots have gone through the roof.

Soltysiak laughed when reminded of what he said in January.

“We’re not in a better place,” he said this week. “All of the challenges that we’re preparing to face still exist — and we have layered on top of them those that go along with volume and the pandemic.”

Every election night, news outlets try to project winners using unofficial results from precincts, surveys of voters leaving polling places, turnout data, and more. (Official results aren’t certified until weeks later.)

But some of that modeling depends on people voting in person, and data from past elections will be less useful this year now that Pennsylvania has changed how they are run. Not to mention that voter behavior is harder to predict during a pandemic. The crisis also means it will take even longer than expected to count mail ballots, county elections officials said.

Philadelphia elections officials, for example, expect mail ballots to make up a majority of the vote, and they won’t even start counting them until the day after the election. Several large counties, including Bucks, Chester, and Montgomery, plan to start counting absentee ballots on election day, but expect to take at least another day or two before finishing.

Christine Reuther, a Delaware County councilwoman, said “it would be unreasonable for people to expect results” from her county before Saturday.

Four days after the election.

The only silver lining for the primary, officials said, is that Biden and Trump are all but assured to win their party nominations, which could lower turnout and the number of mail ballots to count.

But that might also obscure the magnitude of the problem looming in November, when millions will anxiously await the results from Pennsylvania.

“We don’t have any choice at this point but to take our lumps on June 2 and then learn lessons from it and apply them forward,” Lehman said.

“That’s the only hope I have,” he added. “But I don’t have a whole lot of it.”

The new waiting game

The time it takes to count ballots isn’t a sign of fraud, corruption, or any other failure of the electoral system. Rather, it’s a direct result of reforms to help expand access to voting.

In the past, the vast majority of votes were cast in person. Pennsylvania had one of the most restrictive absentee voting systems in the country, and only about 5% of votes in any election were cast by mail. So when polling places sent results back to county elections offices, they accounted for almost all the votes.

The new law enacted last year changes that.

It was a bipartisan move to make voting more flexible and convenient. It will also dramatically increase the number of mail ballots. (Due to a quirk in the law, Pennsylvania technically has two kinds of mail ballots, “absentee” and “mail-in,” that are functionally the same for voters.)

Philly will have way fewer polling places for next month’s primary because of coronavirus. Find yours here.Mail ballots also take much longer to count than in-person votes. Physical voting machines keep track of votes as they are cast and spit out a summary at the end of the night. But mail ballots require opening two different envelopes and then scanning the paper ballots. And some ballots need to be counted by hand, either due to voter error or problems with scanners.

“It will definitely not be same-night election results that people are used to. We will certainly be well into the next day,"" said Gail Humphrey, the chief clerk for Bucks County. “Those scanners can jam.”

“If there’s absolutely nothing that happens by technology that we didn’t foresee,” she said, “we’ll still be at least, bare minimum, into the next day still counting.”

Coronavirus adds to the challenge

The pandemic led to a volume of mail ballot requests that is far exceeding officials’ expectations. As of Wednesday, Pennsylvania voters had sent in almost 1.6 million applications for mail ballots, far exceeding the total of 107,000 in the 2016 primary.

That means a significant strain on counties to actually tally them, just as social distancing guidelines make gathering workers to do so that much harder.

“The number of people you’re going to have being able to canvass, or to open up envelopes even, at an eight-foot table is pretty much one. And one at the next table,” said Randall O. Wenger, chief clerk of the Lancaster County Board of Elections. “It’s going to impact and slow down that process as well.”

“I don’t have any delusion that we’re going to have [all the ballots] opened and scanned and adjudicated that same day,"" Wenger said. ""Not going to happen.”

Philly voters have requested more mail ballots than all of Pennsylvania did in 2016Counties also have to figure out how many people they can even dedicate to counting ballots, given how messy in-person voting at polling places is likely to be. In Philadelphia, which will have 77% fewer polling places this year, elections staff will be too busy to count mail ballots, said Lisa Deeley, chair of the City Commissioners, who run elections.

“It’s unrealistic to think I’m going to have people to go sit and count ballots,” she said. “Election day is going to be quite the challenge, and it’s going to pretty much take up all our bandwidth on election day.”

Things could be even worse in November, officials said. It remains to be seen if the outbreak will have eased by then, or if it will be spiking anew. What is certain, though, is that the volume of mail ballots will be much higher because of higher turnout for the general election. And the presidential election in Pennsylvania will likely be decided by razor-thin margins, after Trump won by less than 1% of the votes cast in 2016.

How to fix the problem

There are two ways to lessen the waiting time, elections officials said: Start counting earlier and reduce the time it takes.

Reducing the processing time requires money to buy more machines and hire more staff to operate them. So starting earlier is the simpler fix.

But when the election law was changed last year, it required counties to wait until 8 p.m. before starting to count mail ballots.

Pennsylvania Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar, who oversees elections, said at the time that she believed counties could manage the task. But pressure from the counties led state lawmakers to make a change in March: Counties can now begin counting mail ballots at 7 a.m. on election day, when polls open.

“I’ve only got 29 precincts, it’s not going to take me days and days,” said Florence Kellett, director of elections in Wyoming County.

Kellett and officials in several other counties said they would begin counting during election day. Still, they said lawmakers should update the law again, to allow them to start counting ballots days or even weeks earlier.

In recent weeks, Boockvar has taken up that call.

The 7 a.m. change helps, “but I don’t think it’s going to be sufficient for many counties,” she told reporters Wednesday during a conference call. “I think some of the races that are close, we will get results quickly. But if there are close races, it may take a couple of days.”

These budgets can surpass $2 million for schools like the University of Tennessee.

Is it worth it?

I study economics. Research I recently did shows just how big the payoff for spending money to recruit the best players can be.

Opinion

Half a million dollars

The schools that secure five-star recruits — the 30 or so players judged to be in the top one-hundreth of the top 1% of high school football players — can increase total revenue by over $500,000 for a university’s athletic department. Most football teams never secure a five-star recruit. Others, such as the University of Alabama and Louisiana State University, recruit three or four every year.

My research team came to this $500,000 figure by linking 10 years’ worth of football recruiting information from Rivals.com and Scout.com, two of the top recruiting services for prospective college football players, with federal data on how much colleges take in and spend on athletics, win-loss records for individual schools and post-season bowl appearances.

The data shows revenue and expenditures for each sport separately, which made it possible to determine what a football recruit added to football revenue at each university.

Schools like the University of Oklahoma, the University of Michigan and Notre Dame, which on average bring in over a dozen four- or five-star recruits every year, bring in millions of dollars more in revenue when they land more of the top recruits in a given year.

For instance, my estimates suggests that Clemson University’s five-star recruits, of which there were five, and 12 four-star recruits — also in top one-quarter of 1% of all players — in the 2020 recruiting class will increase the school’s football revenue by well over $3 million, well above its $1.8 million recruiting budget.

The reason is simple: Top recruits help teams win.

Since a top recruit correlates strongly with increases in the number of victories, they help determine the type of post-season play. Five-star recruits are not the deciding factor in whether a school gets to a bowl game, the mark of a winning season — the big-time programs will have winning records every year without fail.

But they do push them to the upper echelon of post-season play — the College Football Playoffs or its forerunner, the Bowl Championship Series. Reaching the championship level in college football contributes to lucrative broadcast contracts, corporate partnerships and even more successful recruiting.

Very few schools are consistently successful in the race to recruit top football talent and win at the highest levels. Just as nine schools have been responsible for 20% of all players drafted into the NFL over the past two decades, only six schools have made it to the College Football Playoff championship game.

Financing other sports

There is more than hoisting football trophies at stake.

College football is a key driver of athletic department revenue as well, helping to pay for other sports programs. Athletic departments that field more than 30 varsity teams do so understanding that fewer than five varsity teams generate enough revenue to cover the entire athletics department’s expenses.

In fact, some critics argue that big-time college sports, which feature rosters made up primarily of black student-athletes, pay for the sports programs that include overwhelmingly white student-athletes, such as lacrosse and swimming, which receive far less media attention but are the bulk of athletes in major collegiate sports programs. Sixty-one percent of all student athletes are white.

Football revenue also helps finance athletic recruiting efforts and amenities, such as state-of-the-art facilities. All of that takes money, which takes recruits, which takes money. Every recruiting video, campus visit and hosted meal is a line item on an athletic department’s budget.

COVID-19 repercussions

The possibility of there being no college football season in the fall of 2020 is making athletics departments fear big budget cuts.

Already, some schools are dropping sports that were subsidized by college football revenues, like men’s soccer and wrestling. Smaller schools that depend on a few $1 million paydays in September from the major programs, may be left with gaping holes in their athletic budgets, threatening all sports.

There is little doubt that changes are coming to the current model of athletic department operations through a variety of converging forces. COVID-19 is unleashing widespread job losses, business closures and declining consumer spending that will limit what fans and advertisers can spend on football.

Another factor could be a change by the National Collegiate Athletic Association — which governs college athletics — that could allow student-athletes to get paid from their name, image and likeness.

While schools rich with talent may continue to get richer, those schools further down the recruiting pecking order will be left to wonder how they can survive at all.

1935,https://www.naturalnews.com/2020-05-23-plandemic-google-drive-delete.html,2020-05-23,"If you have a copy of Plandemic in your Google Drive, Google might try to surreptitiously delete it","(Natural News) Fake news empire The Washington Post is on a mission to make sure that every single copy of the popular Plandemic documentary film is removed from every last crevice of the internet.

The Jeff Bezos-owned, left-wing rag recently published an article in its “technology” section explaining that fake news employees of the paper are basically being paid to scour the web in search of Plandemic so they can report it to the hosting website and try to have it removed.

One perhaps unexpected place that the Post has had no trouble getting Plandemic removed from is Google Drive, a cloud-based file-sharing service that many Facebook users and YouTubers have been linking to whenever public copies of the film get censored or removed by Big Tech platforms.

Even though Google Drive accounts are supposed to be private, much like your personal hard drive, the Post has reportedly been successful in convincing Google to invade users’ files and remove Plandemic whenever they find a copy.

To those who know the Constitution, this is an obvious violation of free speech and personal privacy. But to the Post, it is a necessary response to the “weaponization” of Google Drive’s services for the purpose of “amplify[ing] dangerous content.”

Because Plandemic offers a different take on the pandemic that does not fully align with the official narrative, the Post and its Big Tech partners do not believe that you should be allowed to view it.

Listen below to The Health Ranger Report as Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, discusses how even Brighteon is now being censored by Facebook, probably because it hosts the Plandemic film without question or restriction:

The Post is now actively policing channels, pages that try to share the Plandemic film

One would think that, logically speaking, there is nothing to fear from allowing Plandemic to circulate far and wide if the content it contains is “false” and “dangerous” as the Post claims. It will eventually debunk itself, right?

Since the fix is on to force it down the memory hole, however, we can only conclude that there must be something to Plandemic that those fomenting the sham crusade against it do not want the public to learn.

Facebook and YouTube both announced back in early May that Plandemic had to go from their platforms because it makes “medically unsubstantiated” claims about the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.

Among other things, the film questions the alleged importance of lockdowns. It also features the astute Dr. Judy Mikovitz who wrote a powerful book entitled,Â Plague of Corruption: Restoring Faith in the Promise of Science that questions vaccine safety and effectiveness, a big no-no.

What many social media users are having to do in order to still draw attention to Plandemic online is manually edit out Dr. Mikovitz’s interviews, for instance, or remove the “most problematic claims,” to quote the Post. In other words, only censored versions of the Plandemic trailer are being allowed to circulate.

Elon Musk of Tesla conducted his own witch hunt back in March against the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, which is similarly being targeted by Big Tech. Musk tweeted a link to a Google Drive document citing a study about the alleged efficacy of the drug, and since that time Google has removed and blocked that document.

When asked if Google actively scans the files that users store in Google Drive, Google spokeswoman Alex Krasov refused to say, adding that her company “doesn’t go into details” about how its anti-misinformation policies are enforced.

Employees of the National Research Center for Epidemiology and Microbiology named after N. F. Gamalei of the Ministry of Health of Russia tested their vector vaccine against COVID-19. The experiment was successful: immunity was confirmed, no negative effects were found, Alexander Gunzburg, the director of the center said.

""As for the developers, they tested it on themselves to protect themselves in the first place, so that they could continue developing the vaccine during the pandemic. Everyone involved in the development are protected accordingly,"" said Alexander Gunzburg.

Answering the question of whether there were any side effects, the academician replied:

""No. Everyone is alive, healthy and happy.""

He did not specify the number of colleagues who tested the vaccine on themselves, although, according to him, it goes about a wide circle of employees of the center - developers, organizers of preclinical studies and technologists.



The vaccine that the research center is developing is a promising vector vaccine based on the DNA of the adenovirus, in which the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus gene was integrated. The adenovirus is used as a ""container"" to deliver the coronavirus gene to cells, launch the synthesis of the coat proteins of the new coronavirus (the 'corona,' which earned the coronavirus its name) and thereby ""introduce"" the immune system to the potential enemy. Vaccines of this type are known as vector vaccines.



In mid-May, Alexander Gunzburg said that the vaccine was successfully tested on small animals - mice and guinea pigs. He also said that if the trials on primates, and then on volunteers, end successfully, the production of the vaccine against coronavirus in Russia may begin in August. However, it will be impossible to provide the vaccine to all citizens of the Russian Federation, the academician said. The vaccine will be delivered to doctors, law enforcement officers and social workers in the first place.

The daily increase in the number of new cases of COVID-19 in Russia remains at about the same level for three consecutive days, while the number of deaths in one day was the largest for the entire period of the coronavirus situation in Russia.

For the time being, there are a total of 326,448 cases of coronavirus infection in the country. The growth rate makes up 2.8%, and the indicator shows a steady downward trend. As many as 8,894 new cases of coronavirus infection were detected in 84 regions, of which 42.2% did not have any clinical manifestations of the disease.

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) took to Twitter Monday to explain in clear terms to a liberal commentator why the “Obamagate” scandal is such a huge deal.

Gabriel Sherman, an opinion writer for the left-wing magazine Vanity Fair, was apparently confused about what conservatives find to be unseemly about the Obama administration’s unmasking of American citizens, including retired Gen. Michael Flynn, in December 2016. Flynn, who was tapped to be President Donald Trump’s first national security adviser, was surveilled in conversation with former Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.

“Serious questions for Trumpers,” Sherman wrote on Twitter last Friday. “What is the scandal of unmasking an American official caught on an intercept discussing US sanctions policy with Ambassador of a hostile foreign country that had just launched a massive cyber attack on our election?”

Uhh, he was the incoming National Security Advisor & a 3-star general. He’s SUPPOSED to discuss sanctions policy. That’s his job.

That’s a win for many kids,"My heart will break for older teens if they don’t get to play sports in Illinois this summer, or maybe this fall, because of the coronavirus. Most are nearing the end of their competitive sports days, and you hate to see them robbed.

For younger kids, I see a silver lining. It’s a chance for them to do more bike riding. They can learn to rollerblade or skateboard. Maybe they can join their parents for runs or walks.

They could get a much-needed break from an over-scheduled life, especially when it comes to sports.

Columnists In-depth political coverage, sports analysis, entertainment reviews and cultural commentary.

Or, maybe not. In Missouri, a 40-team youth baseball tournament was held last weekend by GameTime Tournaments. You won’t see this in Illinois right now because of the stay-at-home order to curb the spread of the virus. But, at least one Illinois team, the Black Sox from central Illinois, made the trip, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported.

GameTime instituted social distancing guidelines, including no high-fives, and sanitized the ball often. But some things can’t be helped in baseball: The catcher always will be positioned behind the batter. Players bump into each other on some plays. Out of habit, coaches are bound to get close to players to give instruction.

After being at home for weeks, the games had to be a relief for the players and parents who watched. But 40 teams? That’s downright irresponsible, even if permissible by Missouri’s looser restrictions related to the virus.

Fewer games, or no games for a year, could be a very good thing for kids.

Almost from the time they’re born, too many kids heed a schedule. At 5, you can be signed up for sports leagues. There are 7-year-olds who practice four or five days a week, whether it’s football, soccer or baseball, followed by games on the weekends.

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends 60 minutes of daily physical activity for kids in grade school through high school. The kids don’t need to be part of an expensive organized team to get it. But we’ve lost our creativity and spontaneity. The days of neighborhood kids putting together sandlot games went away decades ago.

I know young adults who started sports early, some at 5, and by the time they reached middle school, they didn’t want to practice. Losses got shrugged off because there was always another game.

They burned out. Five years ago, participation studies showed that about 70% of children quit playing sports by the time they are 13.

A friend’s daughter, who had the ability to play soccer in college on a scholarship, stunned her parents when she dropped her club early in her teens. She had tired of it.

Our friends had invested thousands of dollars in games, training and cross-country travel. They had counted on that scholarship. I covered high school sports for nine years as a reporter and met many parents who had done the same. Parents are better off investing early in their children’s college tuition instead of spending lots on expensive sports clubs and personal coaches.

In youth sports, for every knowledgeable coach, you can find others who just aren’t very good, though they mean well.

Some don’t know how to train athletes properly. Some encourage kids to specialize in one sport year-round. The more games, the better — that’s the thinking of some coaches, parents and kids.

Studies show that specializing in one sport contributes to a higher rate of injuries, especially from physical overuse.

“There’s plenty of data that says it’s much better to play multiple sports,” Dr. James P. Bradley told me. He’s the head orthopedic surgeon for the Pittsburgh Steelers and president of the American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine based in Rosemont.

Bradley told me about a 13-year-old patient whose father had him throwing lots of pitches in baseball.

“ ‘You know, you’re ruining his shoulder,’ ” Bradley told the father. “ ‘Let him play basketball, run track. When he’s growing whiskers, then we get him throwing curveballs.’ ”

Let kids engage in more “free play,” as doctors call it. It’s unstructured time to run around, free of parental interference, yet critical for physical and emotional development. It’s about kids trying different sports. It lets kids be kids.

The coronavirus will put some limits on that for now, but it should be the goal.

1423,https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/19/21262934/google-alphabet-ceo-sundar-pichai-interview-pandemic-coronavirus,2020-05-19,Sundar Pichai on managing Google through the pandemic,"Like all big tech companies, Google and Alphabet are playing an outsized role in our lives as the coronavirus pandemic continues. Whether it’s helping people find reliable information in search, working with the government on testing, building an exposure-tracking system into Android and iOS in partnership with Apple, or battling misinformation on YouTube, Google’s capability — and responsibility — has never been greater.

Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai recently joined The Vergecast to talk about the challenges Google faces during this time, including a shift in its core ad business and the challenges of managing the company remotely. Pichai is himself adapting to remote work; he’s actively blocking out more time on his calendar to read and think, something he used to do during his commute. And he’s learning to make pizza from scratch by watching YouTube videos.

“It came out okay,” he said.

Pichai also talked about Google’s commitment to its hardware business, including the Pixel phone line, and how the company is continuing to try to simplify its famously complex messaging app strategy.

“The irony of the Google Meet team working remotely to make and iterate the product to get it to where they wanted it to be was very interesting to see,” said Pichai.

You can listen to the full interview below, in the podcast player of your choice, or scroll down to read a full transcript, lightly edited for clarity.

Nilay Patel: There’s three things I really want to talk about. One, how Google is handling the pandemic. Two, how your business is being impacted. And three, I talk to every CEO about how they manage their time, and I’m confident that managing a company the size of Google remotely has changed that.

I want to talk about all that stuff. But there were two big stories about Google that are important [from last week]. I want to ask two questions about them right away. First, there’s a big NBC piece from April Glaser suggesting that your diversity efforts have been wound down [and] that the company is not even using the word “diversity” internally anymore. Is that true?

Sundar Pichai: Diversity is a foundational value for us. Given the scale at which we build products and the fact we do it locally for our users, we are deeply committed to having that representation in our workforce. I think we were one of the earliest companies to publish transparency reports, and we’ve shared that ever since. And we just released our recent annual diversity report. We’ve made modest progress in critical areas. There’s a long ways to go. But it is really important.

What we are doing in the company is constantly at our scale. We look at that first — see what works, what we can scale up better. All I can say is we probably have more resources invested in diversity now than at any point in our history as a company, in terms of the scale and the resources we put in.

NP: There’s part of that report, which is interesting to talk about, because we hear about it in regards to Facebook a lot, but I don’t know if we’ve ever really asked anybody at Google about it. It’s that criticism from the conservative side of the aisle is something you’re more responsive to with these initiatives, with how you’re running the company. Is that something you think about, in terms of who’s criticizing you from where?

Our diversity efforts, we don’t bring any such lens to it. There are many areas where we are still, as an industry, as a company, dramatically underrepresented. So there’s a long way for us to go. And we’ve just not had that consideration. I think, independently, just within the company, we have definitely made efforts to make sure the company can accommodate viewpoints, and no one feels they’re not part of the company, regardless of their political viewpoints, amongst other things. But that’s about it. I think these are two independent things.

Dieter Bohn: So the other big story that hit yesterday, from the day we’re recording, was over at The Information, about Mario Queiroz and Marc Levoy quietly leaving the Pixel division, and the Pixel sales numbers maybe not being super great. Is the Pixel business living up to where you hoped it would be right now?

I’ll comment on hardware, and then talk about Pixel, too.

The last couple of years have been a major integration phase for us because we’ve combined our Google hardware efforts with Nest. We absorbed the mobile division of HTC. So it’s been a lot of stitching together. And we have a wide product portfolio, too. So it’s definitely been a building phase. We’re super committed to it for the long run. Hardware is hard. And it definitely has components, which take real time to get it right, thinking about underlying silicon or display or camera or any of those tacks. And so we are definitely investing in it, but that timeline. I think we’ve made a lot of progress.

“Hardware is hard.”

Pixel 3A last year was one of our highest NPS-rated products ever, and definitely even benchmarked outside. So to me, it’s a clear indication we have made a lot of progress. We just launched Pixel Buds this week, which you guys covered — thank you — to a good reception. Our Nest Home Hub products are definitely doing well.

We take a long-term view. We are not in it just for phones alone. We have a vision of where computing needs to go. And I think it’s really hard to drive that vision without doing hardware, software, and services together. You have to think of the intersection of it. I see a lot of value in thinking about it and doing it that way.

We are definitely going to have hiccups. We are a nascent player in a really complex space, so not everything’s going to be smooth. But am I excited about our portfolio for later this year — especially if I take a longer-term view? Because some of the deeper efforts we are putting in will take three to four years to actually play out. And when they come in, I think I’m excited about how they will shape where we are going.

DB: Yeah. I’ve asked you “How serious are you about hardware?” every year since you created the division, and sort of like with self-driving cars it’s, “Well, it’ll be a five-year timeframe, it’ll be a five-year timeframe.” That five-year timeframe always seems to be five years out.

So when you say you’re in it for the long term, is that still the timeframe that you’re thinking of for [hardware] really bringing back really serious results in terms of big sales numbers or big influence in the market or are you looking for something more immediate?

No, I mean we think about our hardware efforts obviously in the context of our overall computing efforts and in addition to what our ecosystem is doing. So we take that into account. I do think it’s important we build a sustainable business, financially, too. Because I look at the level of investment hardware needs, both in terms of all the technology R&D you need to do, the kind of supply chain you need to develop, as well as the go-to-market investments you need. So it’s a deep investment. So to do it well, I think you have to do it with a clear financial sustainability goal. So that’s important.

So for me, three reasons. One is to drive computing forward. The second is we really guide our ecosystem. Pretty much everything we’ve done well, you can go all the way back and Android’s early days, Samsung Galaxy Nexus, which we worked together, was a pivotal phone. Nexus 7 in the tablet world. I can point to Chromebooks — all along, we did our original hardware to kind of bootstrap it. And I look at areas maybe where we haven’t done opinionated [work] — maybe [smart]watch is a good example where we haven’t. And then you can see it’s tough to guide an ecosystem to what your vision of it is, just building the underlying platform.

So I think that’s the second reason. And third is to really build a sustainable hardware business. I think all of it is important, and that’s how I think about it. And I’m excited. Rick [Osterloh] and team, working closely with Hiroshi [Lockheimer] and team, they have that long-term view. So we’re pretty committed to it.

Listen to The Vergecast, the only podcast you need to make sense of this week’s tech news, hosted by Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn. Subscribe here!

DB: So you’re the CEO of Alphabet now, in addition to Google. How much of your time do you actually even get to devote to hardware? Are you looking at prototypes? Is it just sort of one meeting in a week? Or is it a larger part of your time?

It’s just a coincidence, I think, I spent my morning with the team today talking about our portfolio for next year.

DB: Anything you want to tell us?

You guys are going to figure it out anyway!

It’s a good question. Rick and Hiroshi drive these efforts. But I try to spend time in a more stepped-back way on some of the bigger things they are doing over time.

NP: Dieter is pointing out — he just reviewed the Galaxy... A51?

DB: That’s right.

NP: That’s a cheap phone. He gave it a seven. The reason we reviewed it—

I saw the intro to the video where you said, “This phone sells more than the Galaxy.” I actually watched the video.

DB: It actually was the top-selling phone last quarter worldwide.

I think I learned it from watching your video. It was just kind of interesting. Maybe I should have known that.

NP: That’s the question here. When we think about your phones coming out, we think about are you competitive with the flagship Samsung devices? We think, are you competitive with the iPhones? But the bulk of the market is down there, at $399, $499. Is that where you want to be? Or do you want to go make a big flagship phone and take share away from the top of the market?

The area where we have demonstrated the strongest value proposition, that’s why I gave the [Pixel] 3A example, it’s where we clearly have demonstrated it. But having said that, if you want to drive computing forward, that high end is where you’re going to also keep moving the needle. And it’s where we are putting a lot of our effort into.

So you will continue to see us invest in both ends of the spectrum. We care all the way — [we’re] obviously working with our ecosystem [on] entry-level devices. I’m deeply passionate about that. But definitely, the high end is something where we’re putting in a lot of effort. That’s where some of the underlying investments pay. It accumulates over time because it takes two to three years to do some of the deeper investments you need to do it really well.

DB: Are you seeing — especially now with everyone at home — are you seeing big changes in consumer behavior in terms of buying hardware? Is everyone going out and buying Nest cameras? Or they feel that they don’t need them because they’re at home anyway? Anything changing for you there?

Obviously, on the software side, we have clearly seen impact in terms of usage across several of our products. Some products have been negatively affected, too. But we can clearly measure it. Hardware is a bit more complex because it’s really gated by the supply chain, [which] got affected for different products in different ways, and demand has definitely been affected, too. Some of it is to do with lack of retail working well and all that stuff. So I think it is tough to exactly forecast what demand will come back. So for me, it’s too early to tell.

NP: Let’s skip into the broader business of Google and how it’s going. Dieter had the question about consumer behavior. I just had this guess, so I’m going to ask you: is Maps usage way down?

Yeah, totally. [Laughs] You alone not using it is probably contributing. No, I’m just kidding.

NP: I’m always using it.

No, it did have a significant — obviously, as people aren’t driving around, you clearly saw an impact. Interesting to me, was maybe over the last two to three weeks, we definitely see users coming back to it looking for local information. So definitely we see activity back around people trying to find services, what’s around, what’s open. People are exploring and discovering local services again. So there’s this clear inflection, but not clear what that fully means. But that’s where it is.

NP: And then in your broader business — obviously Google makes the bulk of its revenue in advertising. We have felt the effects of the advertising market changing. The whole world has felt the effects of the advertising market changing. How are you seeing those effects at Google? What are you doing to manage against them?

I spoke about it in the earnings call. Compared to January and February, we clearly saw the impact in March. So for sure, Google is not immune to the global economy. In some ways, it’s representative across all sectors. So clearly, as entire sectors have been affected — travel being a particularly severe example of it — we have definitely felt that across the board.

“Google is not immune to the global economy.”

What’s interesting for us is, historically, compared to past cycles, search is something that is very highly ROI-driven, performance-oriented. And so advertisers adapt. They pull back quickly. We see demand shifts and people capitalizing on it. You will see activity in “office furniture” instantly, right then. So you can kind of see the economy adapt in real time. And so it’s fascinating to see it that way. But for sure, it’s definitely impacted our business.

DB: In your earnings call, you hinted that this wasn’t going to turn around right away next quarter. We’re in for a tough time for a while. But coming out of this in however long it takes, do you think that the ad market is going to look substantially similar to what it looked like a year ago? Or are you thinking that things are going to fundamentally change in your ad business, or in your business generally, in a way that you’re able to look at now? Or is it just way too early to tell? It’s too hard to forecast?

It’s the question, which is on a lot of our minds: What are the trends you are seeing which have reverted back to the mean? And what is it that is here to stay? Well, will travel ever return to what it was before? And so on.

It’s obviously tough to predict with the nature of the virus, how long it’ll be. We generally assume the effects will be there for a while. I think that’s the right way to think about it. As a company, we assume that it’s going to take a while to recover, and [we’re] planning for it that way. But it’s a bit hard for me to say.

Human needs are pretty fundamental, I think, in terms of being social, wanting to meet people. Personally, I can’t wait to be back in a... I wish I could go watch a football game or something.

Would I like to go to a music concert? The answer is yes. So I think the innate human need is there. But I think it’ll be a while before we get back to it. So I expect it to be kind of a slow, steady recovery.

NP: How are you thinking about the general push to reopen? At Google, you said people are going to work from home through 2020. What are you thinking about for Google? And then broadly, how are you thinking about this push to reopen, particularly in the United States?

Early on, I felt we were one of the first to go to work from home, partly because I think it made sense for the health and safety of our employees. I felt that, given a lot of our work could be done from home, it made sense for us to contribute to social distancing. Clearly, the needs vary widely across different groups. We talked about hardware earlier — definitely having access to testing equipment, labs, it’s really important. You can’t test whether something works in 5G unless you can actually be in that testing environment.

So it varies widely across teams. And we are going to be conservative on the return back for the broad company. When the local ordinance allows, I think we’ll probably start with trying to get 10 to 15 percent of the company back, prioritizing people who actually kind of need to be there. And that way, we can really have a de-densified environment and have a lot of safety procedures in place. And just because we are talking about 10 to 15 percent capacity doesn’t mean that many people — we can rotate and actually get more people in once or twice a week.

“A vast majority of employees we think will likely work from home through the end of the year.”

And you have people in two different buckets. There are people who really want to come back, and they miss it. Especially at Google, for 20 years, we have genuinely invested in our physical spaces and the culture it creates with a view to having people work well together. And so I think there are people who miss that part of the experience, depending on what your personal situation is. And then there are people on the other side of the spectrum who want to be conservative. So we are trying to make that play out.

But I expect by the end of the year, we’ll be at 20 to 30 percent capacity. Which may still mean we are able to get 60 percent of our employees in once a week, or something like that. And so that’s what we mean, where a vast majority of employees we think will likely work from home through the end of the year. But it’s a very fluid situation. If things, of course, look better, we will adapt to it. We want to be flexible. Trying to really understand what works, what doesn’t work in this.

DB: Are you thinking longer term in terms of the number of people that might work from home or work remotely? Twitter just announced forever. You can work from home for as long as you want. Are you thinking in that way, too? Or are you going to wait and see how things play out?

I want to be driven by data here, and so I view it as a research phase, and [we’ll] see where the data leads us. In some ways, I’m glad Twitter is running a kind of one-end-of-the-spectrum experiment. So thanks, Jack. It’s good to see that end of the spectrum.

Productivity is down in certain parts, and what is not clear to me is — in the first two months, most of the people are already on projects in which they kind of know what they need to do. But the next phase, which will kick in is, let’s say you’re designing next year’s products, and you’re in a brainstorming phase, and things are more unstructured. How does that collaboration actually work? That’s a bit hard to understand and do. So we are trying to understand what works well and what doesn’t.

We’re probably going to be conservative in it. We want to make sure things work well. But coming out of it all, do we all learn and have more flexibility in how we think about this? I think so, yeah. That’s how I would bet.

NP: I’m going to take this moment to somehow transition and ask you about messaging strategy. I’m going to figure it out. You just come with me as we do it.

[Laughs] How can I do a Verge podcast without thinking about our—

DB: Pop quiz, hotshot. Name all the products.

Our entire complexity in messaging is to make sure Verge has plenty of material to work with.

NP: Google has historically been good at dogfooding and using its own products. Obviously, this is a moment to use these products in a way that maybe had never been stressed before. You added gallery view to Meet. That seems like a button that should have been there, and suddenly everybody realized it’s not there, and snap, it’s there.

But there are some bigger competitors. There’s more consumer-focused companies that are succeeding, like Zoom. Is this a moment of clarity for you? To say, “We actually have to win this. We know what we need to do because we’re using our own products as much as we are.”

It’s definitely an important moment. We brought Javier [Soltero] in a few months ago, before all this, with a clear view. So we had a clear sense of where we wanted to go, so some of the efforts were clearly underway, and in some ways, when COVID hit, we weren’t fully done with all the changes we had wanted to make.

I think the irony of the Google Meet team working remotely to make and iterate the product to get it to where they wanted it to be was very interesting to see. Javier has a very, very long commute, and one of his biggest concerns was the commute when he was joining. He’s doing it all virtually now. But it is an important moment. Many schools, many organizations already use Google Meet. So we are doubling down.

“RCS is where we are like United Nations. We try to herd a bunch of people.”

Obviously, COVID has blurred the lines between consumer and enterprise, and people are using products in all kinds of contexts. And so definitely, we are using it as an opportunity to make Google Meet and Google Chat, scale it up and make it more available.

And obviously, we are a service provider [but] we are a platform, too. Hence RCS and all the work we are doing. RCS is where we are like United Nations. We try to herd a bunch of people. So it’s making better progress than it appears because you’re collecting so many people together on it. As people sign up, you will see more and more momentum.

So all of that is coming together well, I think. I’m glad we realigned it, everything with Javier. He works both with our cloud team with Thomas [Kurian], and our platforms team with Hiroshi. And so I think we’ll get to the right place. I’m very excited.

DB: You brought up RCS. You know I’m going to ask. What are the—

This is a rare moment where I am like... because I know Dieter wants to talk about it. So I had to go there.

DB: In an age when Facebook is saying, “We are going to integrate all of our messaging products, and we’re going to put everything under full end-to-end encryption,” do you think that Google having multiple products in multiple contexts is still the way to go? Or do you think there needs to be more integration there?

We definitely want to have a more integrated, simplified view, but in all scenarios, I see our platform offering. Android is open as part of the open platform stack. I think you need an open standard messaging framework. And we have to evolve that from its SMS days, and that’s RCS for me.

And obviously, we’ll continue doing that in all scenarios because I think that’s part of building that open stack. I don’t see that changing. But in terms of our services, I want it to be as simplified for people as possible. And I think we’ve made great strides compared to where we were with Google Meet and Chat. Of course, we have Duo. We intended Duo for consumers and Google Meet and Chat for businesses, effectively. But the lines have blurred. And they share a lot of common underlying technology. They’re both built on WebRTC, and so there’s a lot of common work, and given its common teams, hopefully we can iterate.

But some flexibility, I think it’s fine here.

NP: We started out by talking about phones. One of the reasons Apple’s phones are so sticky is they have a great messaging product. Do you think that that is connected? You need a great sticky messaging product to move people over?

Let me give a user answer and a technical answer, too.

From a user standpoint, any Android phone you get, you always want a phone number-based messaging product, which you’re going to create, and you want something which comes with the platform, and we’re trying to align that. And that integration, I think is critical. And so I do feel it’s an important part and where Android has been behind. So I think it’s important there.

Technically, different OEMs and different carriers having different RCS implementations was one of the biggest causes of fragmentation in Android. It caused real pain. So simplifying that is a tremendous multiplier in terms of productivity and efficiency and simplicity. And so for both reasons, I think, it’s important to invest, and get it right.

NP: So we lured you here by saying we were going to talk about the pandemic. We’ve mostly talked about messaging. I want to make sure we talk about the pandemic.

[Laughs] What a surprise.

NP: I feel like your team prepped you well. You had to know this question was coming. I keep track every week of when Trump and his team held up the flowchart and said, “Some x thousand Google engineers are working on it.”

Just walk me through that day. Did you expect that to come? The next day, Trump said someone from Google had called and apologized to him. Did that happen? Just what was that set of days like?

Very early on through COVID, we decided as a company we should do everything [in] areas where our expertise could help. And so we had a wide set of efforts.

I think there were two efforts, and we were in touch with the [White House] coronavirus task force. And there were two efforts, both in terms of what Google can do to provide more information, and Verily was working on a way to develop wide-scale testing, particularly with an emphasis on drive-through testing, with a focus on first responders. And we were in touch on both efforts. And so that’s what it was.

Today, I think Verily right now is in 86 sites across 13 states. And that’s what that effort was. It’s obviously taken more time than most of us expected to get there, but there were real constraints along the way. But I think we’ve made a lot of progress. My view on this is, at a time of global pandemic, we want to do everything we can to help the US government succeed. And so we’re trying to play our role in it.

NP: I’m just going to ask you directly: did you call President Trump and apologize?

My discussions were with the task force, so that’s who I was talking to.

NP: It’s quite a quote. It just struck me at that time that the distinction between Google and Verily was not being well-made. And so I think my follow-up here is: is that clearer now? You’re the CEO of Alphabet. Verily is under Alphabet. You’re also the head of Google.

I think we were communicating across two areas. We were communicating both. I do feel like the onus is on us as a company to clarify and be clear in terms of how we are communicating. I don’t think we got everything right in terms of communicating across the two groups, which were talking back and forth. So I just wanted to make sure we were clear in terms of how we were communicating.

NP: So what now is the relationship between Verily and Google? Do you still have volunteers working at the Verily project?

Yes. Because they’re both under Alphabet, we view it as areas where we help. So sometimes Google is doing work on health care, Verily is doing health care. If we share resources where we need to, sometimes there could be an AI breakthrough from Google, which is what Verily uses to commercialize. But at a technical level, we can exchange ideas. At a regulatory level, we work together to have a compliance process, and all that framework we built in. But I’m excited at the progress Verily is making as well.

DB: Do you find that separation, as sort of two separate companies under one umbrella, it’s still useful? Or has your thinking changed about the distinction between Alphabet company Verily and Alphabet company Google?

It’s a good question. There are many areas where I find the distinction to actually help because when you take something like Waymo, and the timeframe it needs to operate in, [it’s] dealing with a very different set of issues than building a typical internet product. I like the fact that there’s structural separation, that the Google management team doesn’t have to sit and think through that breadth, and they can be more focused. And it allows us to play these different bets with the different characteristics they would need and different time horizons and so on.

So Alphabet creates that flexibility. The underlying commonality across all of Alphabet is we think [there] has to be a deeper technology play — something based on some foundational technology to solve something. That’s the underlying commonality.

Google is broadly focused on the internet space, and you know if [a problem] is distinctly different from that, and allows us to still apply the technology — maybe share common things like AI and our data centers but have the right structure, right incentives, right approach to go tackle that problem. And so I think it’s been really helpful to have that flexibility. I would expect sometimes we may look at something and say, “Hey, it’s in Google. Maybe it makes sense to be more in Alphabet” or vice versa. We created that structure to create that flexibility. Nest is a good example. It made more sense that it’s aligned closer with the hardware team, and obviously, there’s convergence there.

NP: So there’s a couple big health initiatives inside the Alphabet umbrella. Verily is one of them. This is a moment, I think, for biotech, for health sciences. Would you say Verily is entirely now focused on COVID and the pandemic? Or is it one of many things it’s doing?

It’s one of many things. There are a lot of folks there who are doctors and health care people. Obviously, by calling, they feel motivated to help at a moment like that. So there is a lot of focus. But they’re focused on areas like diabetes, a longer-term disease. So they’re clearly focused on other aspects of health care as well, and they will continue doing that. And so those are big doubled-up efforts already underway.

NP: Google is doing a bunch of other stuff around the coronavirus and COVID-19. What are some of those other things outside of the website?

It’s a big part. By now, we’ve committed over a billion dollars in various ways, be it grants to public health organizations, ad credits to small / medium businesses, and then working in each country through the official agencies’ direct loan programs to small / medium businesses as well. We have undertaken efforts on PPE. There’s the deep work we have done on ventilators out of Rick’s team. And obviously, our support for schools through products like Meet. We have provided Chromebooks. So it spans a wide variety of effort.

And obviously, exposure notification, and the work in the contact tracing has a big effort, jointly with Apple as well.

NP: Is it not often that Google and Apple collaborate at this level. How did that come about? What was your conversation with Tim Cook like? How’s it going in terms of the two companies working together?

It’s been a really terrific effort. It started, I think both of us saw the problem and saw the opportunity to do something, and the teams had started working on it. And at the right point, you realize in this problem, particularly to do it well, we saw some of the earlier app efforts actually struggling to work well.

And so we realized as platform providers, we really want to make it easy, and to make it work at scale, obviously with user consent and privacy protection. And the teams started talking, they saw an opportunity to do it better, so Tim and I connected, and we talked, and we said, “Let’s announce it jointly.” That helps clarify that we are going to approach it consistently.

And so for public health organizations planning, we wanted to give a clear commitment and a framework that they can actually invest, and we’re going to support it as a platform.

The teams talk multiple times a week across the two companies, and we are in conversations with public health organizations around the world. You will see there are large countries where they are fully developing a service on top of it. Our goal here is to have one more toolkit in all the efforts you need to manage COVID. We wanted to make sure we created the option value and add one more step in that toolkit.

NP: When you’re on the phone with Tim Cook, what was a problem that needed the two of you to solve or decision that needed the two of you to make?

One example I would give, when Tim and I talked, it was mainly actually deciding to just go public and lay it all out, earlier than both companies would normally do in a process like this.

We would have probably normally waited to develop, hash out more issues fully. But we both realized, given the public nature of it, given the responsible conversation you need to have with many societal institutions as part of it, it was important that we put it out and shared details, and engaged in a conversation. So we basically made that decision, I think teams had maybe different timelines on when they should be announced. And so we talked through, and we decided to announce it sooner rather than later.

DB: You and I have talked previously about Google’s responsibility when it comes to AI and making sure AI was ethical. With this, you’re in the middle of a pandemic, you’re in the middle of a whole bunch of different countries with their own health organizations. How do you think about your responsibility as the CEO of Google in this pandemic? Because from a certain perspective, it rises to a governmental level of a social contract with users. Or you could say, “No, no. We’re just a tech company.” So how do you see that?

It’s a good question. It’s a one in 100-year kind of issue we are dealing with. So it’s important. I want to do everything we can [and] always be aware that we are a company, a private company, working through an extraordinarily public moment. We clearly have products, which people come and rely on, and so doing that well, both in terms of providing high-quality information and getting it right trumps everything as we handle that. And that is the biggest way by which we can do well.

Beyond that, supporting our employees, supporting the communities we operate in, all that goes hand in hand. And then there are longer-term efforts where, because we have deep technological underpinnings, we can bring that technology to bear to support health care organizations and so on. But that’s the way I think about it.

I think it’s an important moment where the big companies need to step up. But I think you need to do it in a construct in which you realize you’re a private company, and you’re one small part of big value chain to solve this.

NP: So that’s an interesting way of putting it because some of the problems you’re solving are new. We’re going to use the Bluetooth radios in everybody’s cellphone to do exposure notification. I think, historically, that’s a new idea. I don’t think people had that before. It’s obviously got a bunch of new problems to solve.

On the flip side, there are some very old problems to solve here. Are people getting reliable information? Can they trust their leaders? Can they trust the companies they rely on? Google obviously provides a lot of information in search. You provide a lot of information in YouTube.

There have been some massive coordinated disinformation campaigns on both of those platforms. Facebook just recently announced what amounts to a worldwide supreme court for free speech on its platform. Are you thinking you need to do something at that scale to manage the very old problems of reliable information on your platforms?

It’s the foundation of what our company is built on. Search was designed across the web to surface the highest-quality information. So it’s something we’ve thought about for a long time. Obviously, the challenges have gotten more complex and harder, for sure. And so we have evolved our approaches, too.

I’m following what everybody is doing with a lot of interest here. So for example, in YouTube, over the past maybe four years, we have definitely, for categories of information, relied on external experts. On violent extremism, we partner with counter-extremism organizations. So we tap their expertise to help shape our policies. And as we evolved our hate and harassment policies last year, we consulted many organizations. We took inputs.

So I think relying on deep experts, other nonprofit institutions, governmental expertise, is a natural way we want to approach our work. And so I think to me, whether you set up an oversight board — I will look to see what the learnings from it are, and definitely going to study that. I think it’s important to understand that.

I think we are going to be flexible. If we find something works, we will be really open to adopting it. But we also, I think directionally, have really worked hard to bring outside input in terms of policy definition and so on. So that’s how we generally think about it.

NP: I want to just ask about how you are managing Google. Vergecast listeners know I tend to end all these interviews by saying, “How do you manage your time?” And that question, it used to have one kind of very clear set of answers. Now, it’s all different. So as CEO of Google, you’re obviously managing a giant company remotely. You’re dealing with governments. You’re dealing with your own employees. How are you currently just managing your time operating the company?

I’ve tried to have two parallel tracks. One is explicitly, there’s a definite focus on COVID response. So I’m spending a significant chunk of my time on something like that, which I wasn’t spending two months ago.

But also making sure the company operationally is focused on continuing to pursue all efforts they are doing and being able to compartmentalize, and do that, too. And so I’m making sure that our meetings just have a real sense of normalcy, and that’s why I gave the example of the earlier morning meeting today when I was reviewing our product plan for next year. It’s just a normal meeting, which I would have done. And so being able to do—

NP: What surprised you in that meeting?

It is just — timelines are hard to plan around. Your disruptions are kind of concerning. So when you plan timelines — and they’re for sure hard — it’s not a surprise. It’s what was different about the meeting.

NP: I almost got you. I was this close.

[Laughs] Almost. That’s why I’m laughing.

NP: So you’re having meetings on sort of a normal cadence with a sense of normalcy. What else has shifted for you in how you’re managing your time?

The art of doing this, and I’m actually talking to others who have worked from home before, and the line I heard was, “Working from home is as much about not working from home, too.”

I think that’s been harder for IT. How do you draw the boundaries? I miss transitions giving me a chance to drive and think about stuff and process. And so on hand, it’s a bit more efficient because you can move across what we are doing right now might have taken a lot more time, maybe not as a podcast.

“I miss that space to think quietly.”

But I miss the transition. I miss that space to think quietly. And so for me, that’s definitely something I need to progress better. But I’m managing my time. I have a clear sense of the major areas in the company I want to spend a percentage of my time [on]. I actually look back at my calendar every three months to see whether I spent my time on the things I wanted to spend. And I’ve always done that. So any aberrations that come out, I step back and think, “What can I do structurally to make sure I get back to how I want to spend my time?”

So it’s a constant reiterative process. And sometimes you look back in horror, and you realize you got it wrong, and then you course-correct. So that’s how I think about it.

NP: So the classic question I ask is “When do you work?” Because it’s a question I’m very focused on. It sounds like you did a lot of your time working and thinking in those transitions. How are you building that time now? Or is that something you’re just working on?

It’s a good question. I’m trying to force-block times on the calendar, specifically to read and think. I think it’s hard to do. But actually block the time and do that.

That’s how I had the time to watch your Galaxy A51 video. Sometimes just trying to understand what’s going on and spend time outside. So I think carving out that thinking time is one tool I have. But drawing boundaries is something I’m working on as well. Definitely picking up hobbies, which I never thought I had before. I made pizza last week from scratch, thanks to some YouTube cooking video. It turned out okay. And so things like that help.

NP: As you look out over the course of this next year, over the course of the crisis unfolding, what are the leading indicators of change that you’re looking at that maybe other people aren’t looking at? Maybe that’s specific to Google, maybe it’s broader than that. But what are the signals that you see? You have access to a lot of signals. What are the signals you see that indicate change is coming, one way or the other?

It’s effectively user pattern shifts, trying to understand — is telemedicine a real thing? Does it sustain? Or is it just something people do, and do people revert back to how they do things.

So looking at recovery patterns and seeing where you’re actually seeing a difference, a long-run difference, is what we are trying to piece out and understand, where we can. And we’re very interested in how does work culture shift? How does travel and meetings shift for the long run? And hence its impact on things which will do well because of that, and things which will have to adapt. So shifts like that.

Education is a big area where we are watching, and definitely I know you’ve been passionate about rural broadband and connectivity. To me, distance learning really identifies those gaps, too. And so figuring out how through both connectivity and computing we reach those things, is a long-run journey, I think, which we’re working on.

But I think trying to get those snapshots of where things are changing and trying to be data-driven and adapt is something — I do think these are moments of opportunity as well to build a future. History shows through times like this because so many people are facing so many problems, entrepreneurs rethink things and solve things. So it’s definitely worth keeping an eye on.

NP: Do you see it differently around the world? You have access to a lot of data from around the world. Some parts of the world are in different states of this. What are you seeing around the world that is giving you an indication that things are going to change in the long term?

One thing, which has been striking is — I don’t think in our lifetimes we have seen such a global moment where everyone seems to be going through a shared experience. That’s unique. So it’s kind of one of the few positives. It feels like a moment for humanity together as a whole.

But for sure, when you look at places in Asia, which have gone through and come back, we do see some shifts in areas, like as people get used to ordering online, some of those effects seem — some of the shift stays. So we see trends like that. But I see a lot more common than not, which, to me, shows the commonality of humanity, more than how different we are. So there’s more common patterns I see rather than differences.",real

The Grant Park Music Festival on Monday announced the cancellation of its 2020 season, originally set for June 10-Aug. 15 at the Pritzker Pavilion in Millennium Park and other locations across the Chicago area. More than 300,000 people attend the festival each year.

The free classical music festival, featuring the Grant Park Orchestra, under the direction of artistic director and principal conductor Carlos Kalmar, and the Grant Park Chorus, under the direction of Christopher Bell, has been a summertime tradition since 1935. Attracting world-renowned musicians and singers from across the country and around the world, the festival has continuously provided a diverse repertoire of classical music favorites and world premieres. In addition, the festival has been home to classic movie nights (featuring the orchestra providing live accompaniment to screenings of some of Hollywood’s greatest musicals) and Broadway show celebrations.

Among the festival’s canceled events are the annual Independence Day Salute extravaganza, all neighborhood parks programming, as well as master classes and open rehearsals.

“We’re still working to calculate the losses we will experience as a result of a summer without the Grant Park Music Festival,” said festival president and CEO Paul Winberg in statement. ”We hope our longstanding friends and donors will continue to maintain their support during this difficult time, helping the festival to return next summer stronger and more vibrant than ever.”

The news comes on the heels of several other summer music festival cancellations recently announced, including the Chicago Blues Festival, the Chicago Gospel Festival, the Chicago House Music Conference & Festival and the Ravinia Festival in Highland Park.",real
355,https://www.worldhealth.net/news/fda-authorizes-2nd-blood-filtering-device-covid-19/,2020-04-17,FDA Authorizes 2nd Blood Filtering Device For COVID-19,"An emergency authorization was issued to Terumo BCT’s blood filtering device for COVID-19, and the agency has just done the same for CytoSorbent’s system; both are designed to filter out immune system proteins that fuel the cytokine storm reaction that is associated with the disease.

“We continue to work across all sectors to expedite the development of numerous innovative potential preventive and treatment approaches by both facilitating emergency access for patients, to the extent we can, and supporting the evaluation of potential therapies,” said FDA Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn, M.D. “With today’s authorization of a blood purification device, we are expediting the availability of a treatment option for patients in the ICU to help reduce the severity of the disease. Our staff will continue our around the clock review of all medical products to expedite the availability of treatments to help fight this devastating disease.”

The company’s CytoSorb purification system was previously cleared for use in the European Union to treat septic shock patients receiving intensive care as well as those undergoing heart surgery or those experiencing liver failure.

The FDA emergency authorization allows the filters to be used in American intensive care units for adults suffering from imminent respiratory failure with acute lung injuries or severe infection with COVID-19 disease.

As the body overreacts to the COVID-19 infection a cascading release of white blood cells creates a cytokine storm that can cause severe inflammation, tissue damage and rapidly progressive shock. These systems should help to filter out the proteins fueling the cytokine storm and help to save lives.

The company describes these filters as being plug and play compatible with most blood purification devices or pumps that can be found within an ICU such as dialysis or the lung supporting extracorporeal membrane oxygenation hardware machines.

""As a U.S.-based company with CytoSorb device manufacturing in New Jersey, we are eager to expand the availability of CytoSorb to U.S. hospitals and patients as a treatment option to fight cytokine storm and deadly inflammation that is believed to exacerbate COVID-19 infection,” said CytoSorbents CEO Philip Chan.

“With more than 555,000 documented coronavirus infections, the U.S. leads the world with over 22,000 deaths, and emergently needs new therapies to reduce the severity of this disease,” Chan added, as of early April 13. “This is important not just to reduce poor clinical outcomes and mortality, but to also alleviate the bottleneck for scarce resources such as ventilators and ECMO in the treatment of these critically ill patients.""

This system, according to the company, has been used in over 80,000 treatments overseas to assist with similar kinds of complications that are being seen in COVID-19, as well as with over 200 patients with this infection, and it is included in treatment guidelines in China, Italy, and Panama.

“Under the EUA, we plan to ramp the availability of CytoSorb in a controlled manner, to clinical centers that will work with us to generate data and leverage our knowledge of how to use the device most effectively,” Chan said.",fake
1496,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/19/trumps-coronavirus-drug-white-house-reaction-269556,2020-05-19,Trump's drug surprise triggers a White House playbook: Defend and clean up,"Trump’s unsolicited announcement reflected the president’s personal concerns about the coronavirus, a threat he spent months publicly downplaying only to see it infiltrate his inner circle in recent weeks. He started taking the drug around the same time two White House staffers tested positive for the coronavirus. The decision also showed Trump’s penchant for bucking the establishment — in this case, an alarmed medical community that has been skeptical about hydroxychloroquine’s effectiveness in helping combat coronavirus.

“I think that most people kind of expected he was on this or some other kind of prophylactic from the beginning,” said Jason Miller, a senior communications adviser for Trump’s 2016 campaign and co-host of the podcast “War Room.” “You’ve got people in the White House who have got it, he’s shaking a number of hands, you look at someone like [British Prime Minister] Boris Johnson having it, and the fact that the president has been so healthy through this, people probably suspected he was on something.”

Many of the key questions about the president’s use of hydroxychloroquine remained unanswered Tuesday: How much he’s taking, how long he planned to take it and how it would interact with his existing heart medication. Trump's physician said only that he and the president had made the decision together.

Instead, throughout the day, Trump simply defended his use of the drug, saying he believed hydroxychloroquine “gives you an additional level of safety” and “doesn’t hurt people,” and said “people are going to have to make up their own mind” regarding the drug’s efficacy. The White House declined to comment beyond Trump's remarks.

“This is an individual decision to make,” Trump told reporters after meeting with Republican senators on Capitol Hill. “But it’s had a great reputation, and if it was somebody else other than me, people would say, ‘Gee, isn’t that smart?’”

Yet recent research on the drug has not given it a great reputation for treating or preventing the novel coronavirus that has raced around the world, infecting upward of 1.5 million Americans and killing more than 90,000 of them so far.

In observational studies, the treatment has shown limited or no benefits for coronavirus patients, and may even cause heart problems like arrhythmia. And there are only limited results from studies on whether hydroxychloroquine could be effective as a prophylactic measure. More extensive studies are currently in the works.

Still, Trump has promoted the drug for weeks, encouraging Americans to take it. His proselytizing has led to a hydroxychloroquine shortage, which has had serious ramifications for people who have long used the drug to treat lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases.",real

North American culture practically worships the pharmaceutical industry and often fails to recognize many of the issues within it. Many Americans are completely unaware that new prescription drugs have a 1 in 5 chance of causing serious reactions, even after being approved.

In fact, approximately 1.9 million people are hospitalized annually due to properly prescribed medication (not including any overdoses, self-prescriptions, or mis-prescribing). 128,000 people die every year in the U.S. from drugs prescribed to them, so why is this still happening? The reality is, drug companies make a lot of money from selling prescriptions, and they even pay doctors to do it for them.

If you’ve ever questioned this industry and your doctor’s motives, here is some good news: You can now find out how much your doctor is paid annually to prescribe any drug. In addition, you can also search any company name and find out how much they pay doctors in total every year.

The Database That’s Exposing Big Pharma’s Money Trail

The governmental website Open Payments Data

The two former options allow you to see how much doctors and hospitals are paid annually by pharmaceutical companies to prescribe drugs. If you search a specific company, on the other hand, you can see a detailed summary of their spendings. There’s specific information outlining which doctors are paid the highest amounts, how many doctors they pay nationwide, the nature of these payments, and then specific details of every single payment they made to doctors that year.

For example, when you type Big Pharma giant Gilead Science Inc. into the tool bar, you can see that the company spent $36,830,535.40 in Total General Payments and $45,394,349.76 in Total Research Payments in the year 2015 alone. 48.4% of payments were classified as “Compensation for services other than consulting, including serving as faculty or as a speaker at a venue other than a continuing education program.” The top paid physician made more than $600,000 in 2015 from simply prescribing drugs manufactured by Gilead Science Inc.

It doesn’t take much common sense to understand what this could mean, particularly since it’s hardly a secret that pharmaceutical companies essentially buy out the medical industry. Numerous pharmaceutical companies have paid doctors and researchers to understate the dangers of both drugs and their negative side effects, and to falsify research as well.

Arnold Relman, Harvard Professor and former editor of the New England Journal of Medicine, put it perfectly when he said, “The medical profession is being bought by the pharmaceutical industry, not only in terms of the practice of medicine, but also in terms of teaching and research. . . . The academic institutions of this country are allowing themselves to be the paid agents of the pharmaceutical industry. I think it’s disgraceful.”

Don’t Be So Quick to Blame Your Doctor…

If you’ve visited Open Payments Data‘s platform and searched your doctor within their database, take a moment to reflect on what you’re really looking at. Just because your doctors receive payments from pharmaceutical companies doesn’t necessarily mean they’re terrible people; it could just mean that they’re doing their jobs.

It’s unlikely your personal doctor designed the current structure of the medical industry. Your doctor may not even understand the complexity of the pharmaceutical industry because MDs aren’t properly educated on these drugs. Many doctors genuinely believe they’re helping people through the use of medication; they don’t see the bigger picture here because it’s not included in their education. Plus, it’s often illegal for MDs to prescribe natural cures instead of pharmaceutical drugs and conventional treatments, particularly when it comes to the cancer industry (check out this CE article that exposes the truth about cancer).

In addition, when you actually think about it, it makes perfect sense that some doctors are being paid by pharmaceutical companies. Of course Big Pharma would require doctors’ help in creating drugs and validating their use; it’s completely legal and should be expected of them. However, there’s clearly a grey area here that cannot be ignored.

Pharmaceutical companies, rather than qualified and unbiased doctors, define a lot of the information that MDs are taught, and Big Pharma often influences medical professors and funds university programs. For example, 1,600 Harvard professors stated that they or a family member have ties to drug companies that could bias their teachings or research. The pharmaceutical industry donated more than $11.5 million to Harvard in 2008 for “research and continuing education classes.” Many Harvard students have expressed concern over this and it even made mainstream news when a student was belittled by his professor for asking about the side effects of a drug his professor was unlawfully promoting in class.

This has also been a prevalent issue within psychiatry. As Dr. Irwin Savodnik of UCLA explains, “The very vocabulary of psychiatry is now defined at all levels by the pharmaceutical industry.” This is partially because the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), the text most psychiatrists in the U.S. refer to to diagnose and treat their patients, is heavily biased toward using pharmaceutical drugs instead of therapy. Read more about this in our CE article here.

If you haven’t yet been exposed to this side of the U.S. medical industry, I can understand that there may be some confusion. Why would pharmaceutical companies and some doctors conspire to over-prescribe or mis-prescribe people when their sole purpose should be to help their patients? The simple answer is profit.

The main reason we take so many drugs is that drug companies don t sell drugs, they sell lies about drugs. This is what makes drugs so different from anything else in life… Virtually everything we know about drugs is what the companies have chosen to tell us and our doctors… the reason patients trust their medicine is that they extrapolate the trust they have in their doctors into the medicines they prescribe. The patients don’t realize that, although their doctors may know a lot about diseases and human physiology and psychology, they know very, very little about drugs that’ve been carefully concocted and dressed up by the drug industry… If you don t think the system is out of control, please email me and explain why drugs are the third leading cause of death… If such a hugely lethal epidemic had been caused by a new bacterium or a virus, or even one-hundredth of it, we would have done everything we could to get it under control. – Dr. Peter Gotzsche, co-founder of the Cochrane Collaboration (source)

Why Big Pharma Wants You To Take Pills

This may be obvious to many of you, but, just to be clear: The entire medical industry is focused around profit. It’s similar to any other industry in that every service it provides you with, or item it convinces you to purchase, makes someone else a lot of many. In the case of a pharmaceutical company, they can only make money if you’re sick.

So, it wouldn’t really be in the best interest of Big Pharma to sell drugs without any negative side effects. If they produced drugs that actually 100% cured people, how would they continue to profit off our illnesses?

This is precisely why Big Pharma does not get involved with all-natural medicines; there is no profit to be made in plants. Anyone can grow a plant with the right climate and it’s much cheaper to manufacture than synthetic drugs. It’s also easier to make pills in larger quantities than plants. and then when you consider the economies of scale, Big Pharma is able to generate an even greater profit.

Big Pharma has infiltrated pharmaceutical drugs into other industries too. If you eat animal products, then you’re inadvertently ingesting the hormones, antibiotics, and other pharmaceutical drugs given to those animals. Antibiotics, birth control pills, painkillers, and other pharmaceutical drugs can be found in tap water as well.

Let’s take a moment to look at the bigger picture: Most industries are currently driven by money, not passion. It seems strange, but this is precisely the issue within the medical industry. I’m sure many doctors choose their occupation because they’re passionate about helping people. However, until Big Pharma stops playing such a crucial role in creating their job descriptions, it will be difficult for MDs to actually help people without simultaneously hurting them.

It’s clear that we need a systemic change in values. Until we start to work “for the people” rather than “for the profit,” we cannot expect these outcomes to change. It’s hardly surprising that Big Pharma wants you to be sick because they’re not just in the business to cure people — they also need to make a profit.",fake
1816,https://dcgazette.com/2020/the-game-of-truth/,2020-05-22,The Game of Truth ⋆ Dc Gazette,"When newly minted White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany took the stage last week for the first time—the first time a Trump press secretary has issued a formal conference in over six months—she encountered a ravenously bloodthirsty media gaggle. It was ready to pounce.

Would they be able to totally eviscerate her as they had a slew of her predecessors? Well, no. She turned the tables on them all. Predators, it seems, had become prey.

While the task of how to feed and water the Washington press corps is no secret to those in the press secretary business, what’s more impressive is when a White House press secretary can feed them the food of their own making. And so it happened. They served it up warm.

It came about 25 minutes into the press conference. Jeff Mason, Reuters’ White House correspondent, asked:

Kayleigh, in a previous life, before you were press secretary, you worked for the campaign. And you made a comment, I believe on Fox, in which you said President Trump will not allow the coronavirus to come to this country. Given what has happened since then, obviously, would you like to take that back?

Of course not. Would you like to take the media’s entire record back, McEnany replied.

Does Vox want to take back that they proclaim that the coronavirus would not be a deadly pandemic? Does The Washington Post want to take back that they told Americans to ‘get a grip, the flu is bigger than the coronavirus’? Does The Washington Post, likewise, want to take back that, ‘Our brains are causing us to exaggerate the threat of the coronavirus’? Does The New York Times want to take back that, ‘Fear of the virus may be spreading faster than the virus itself’? Does NPR want to take back that the flu was a much bigger threat than the coronavirus? And finally, once again, The Washington Post. Would they like to take back that the government should not respond aggressively to the virus?

From her perch atop the bully pulpit, McEnany did not wait around for replies. It was a “drop the mic” moment. But the point still stands.

The mainstream media have printed various misinformed or later-to-be-corrected statements about the impact of COVID-19, mainly because they (like most of America) were still learning about the spread of the virus and its potential public health implications.

The president was learning, too, in real time. The difference is that he is blamed by the media for every statement he makes. If it’s true, then it’s insensitive, and if it turns out to be inaccurate, then it was a blatant lie.

At this point, it seems that the mainstream media exists solely to refute and oppose anything the president says.

Of course, President Donald Trump is not perfect. He exaggerates. He makes blanket statements without caveat. And he is known to protect himself to the point of stretching reality.

Those who have come to know him and work with him on a daily basis understand his foibles. But they also understand that the president is merely human.

He breathes the same air and eats the same food we all do. He has hopes and dreams for his own life and for America that echo our own. Despite his many faults, he was duly elected to lead the country; he has our best interests at heart.

But the media’s raison d’etre exists, not in the truth, but solely in opposition. When the president goes left, whether right or wrong, the media go right. It is as if they have abdicated their roles as fact-finders and investigators and turned into repudiators.

This is laziness at its worst. It lacks credibility and betrays an emotional bias that goes to the heart of truth and falsehood. If the media is so readily able to embrace falsehoods merely to combat the president, are they not just as guilty of the betrayal of truth they accuse the president of committing?

Perhaps the most cynical media iconoclasm centers around the seeming glee some pundits take in the tanking economy. It is almost as if they embrace forced closings and their devastating economic effects as the welcome price of ridding the country of Trump.

Forget about the folks who are suffering. Forget about working mothers with children out of school and nowhere to go. All these pundits have to do is show up at their laptops and type away from the cushy surroundings of their high-end condos. But they aren’t forced to make the hard choices of laying off workers or letting crops rot in the field. For them, reopening the economy is synonymous with losing the political battle.

We all want a free press that is able to question the official line. As a media pundit and commentator, I often question the president’s approach. But it bears asking whether a press is truly “free” when it is bound by its preconceived notions of truth and falsehood.

Perhaps ideological constraints on fairness and objectivity devalue their roles as the investigators and revealers the Founders imagined when they enshrined the First Amendment.

1726,https://www.armytimes.com/news/your-army/2020/05/22/the-army-is-planning-a-mass-recruiting-drive-this-summer/,2020-05-22,The Army is planning a mass recruiting drive this summer,"The general helming Army Recruiting Command is preparing a massive virtual hiring event this summer after the Army’s 245th birthday on June 14. Like the other military branches, the ground service is fighting the anticipated dent to manpower after the coronavirus shuttered recruiting stations across the country this spring.

The push will involve “every person” and “every aspect”of the service that Army recruiting commander Maj. Gen. Frank M. Muth can muster, he said during a telephone call on Wednesday.

An intensive event between June 30 and July 2 will tap senior leaders to visit with city councils, nonprofits, educators and other pillars of local communities — a supercharged version of the program that the Army Chief of Public Affairs already runs, which brings Army generals back to their hometowns to engage with civilians able to influence young people.

“We would do the same thing, but it would end up being on Zoom or [Microsoft] Teams,” said Muth. “The secretary is from Chicago, maybe he engages with the Chicago leadership, and the 101st commander goes down to Nashville because he’s right there. And the 82nd commander goes and he Zooms with Raleigh. There’s all these different ways we can use these folks.""

Muth pitched the idea two weeks ago to the Army’s service secretary and chief of staff, calling it Army National Hiring Days. It will be limited in certain areas based on where shelter-in-place orders are still in effect. But Muth intends for it to be a never-before-seen recruiting drive regardless.

“Every person in the Army is involved. Every asset is involved. Everyone is on message,"" Muth added. ""We are engaging in the ‘Focus 22’ and we’re driving our message for people to either go into the recruiting stations or go to GoArmy.com.”

Army retention rises as economy slumps, but recruiting hasn’t seen a boom yet The general in charge of Army recruiting said the economic downturn doesn't appear to have impacted enlistments — yet.

Focus 22 is in reference to the 22 American cities, like Chicago, Seattle and Los Angeles, with large populations of Generation Z youths who Army leaders say have had minimal exposure to the service as a potential path in life.

Army recruiters were doing fairly well late last year and early this spring in sourcing candidates for service. By March, they had signed up 2,200 more recruits than they had by the same time last year. But the pandemic dampened their efforts as brick-and-mortar stations shuttered and the recruiting enterprise was forced to move completely online.

Right now, the service is about 4,000 contracts short of where it wants be.

“It’s more than we were last year, but at the same time, historically, we’ve had a year where we were behind that much too,” said Muth, adding that had his recruiters “not been in a position to virtually recruit,” they would have done “about zero” new contracts over the past few months.

The looming economic downturn could also help boost recruitment numbers later this summer. Unemployment has hit record levels in recent months, but economists say there’s still uncertainties about how long the slump will last. Bad economies are typically good for military recruiting and retention.

Perhaps an early indicator that confidence in the civilian job market is dropping is the fact that Army retention is roughly 15 percent higher than expected, thanks in part to short-term reenlistment contracts, according to E. Casey Wardynski, the Army’s assistant secretary for manpower and reserve affairs. Wardynski said this week that he still expects the service to meet its targeted end-strength number of 485,000 soldiers.

The Army National Hiring Days event could also “give a good indication” of how the economy will impact recruiting later in the year, according to Muth.

“I don’t know if we’ve seen the upturn yet of what we’d normally get"" during times of high unemployment, said Muth. ""What I would tell you is, I think we’ll ... have an indication by mid-July, beginning of August if things really start to change.”

Muth’s intent is to get as many general officers and command sergeants major as he can to participate. As part of an opening salvo on June 14, he’s also looking to potentially use the Army Golden Knights parachute team and the Fife and Drum Corps, as well as the Army’s legacy divisions.

“That’s kicking off on June 14, but between now and then is our shaping operation. We’re now starting to message out; we’re starting to dominate the digital space,"" Muth said.

Recent Army advertising campaigns have tried to emphasize a different side of the service, with less focus on combat roles. A commercial released last month, and another this month, focus on the Army’s role staffing hospitals and building ad-hoc medical facilities during the coronavirus pandemic.

“Everyone sees us as all armor and infantry and artillery and aviation, which is true, but that’s only 15-20 percent of the Army. A larger portion is the tech, and the help, and the engineers and the logistics,"" Muth added. ""People didn’t realize that.”",fake

Juliet Daly, from Louisiana, went into cardiac arrest and required CPR.

One of her doctors said she ""was about as close to death as you can get.""

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

A 12-year-old from Louisiana has survived a cardiac arrest linked to the coronavirus and a rare inflammatory disorder that has been seen in clusters of children around the world since the pandemic began.

Juliet Daly has made a full recovery after doctors performed two minutes of CPR to revive her.

The medical team later told her father, Sean Daly, that Juliet was suffering from the same multisystem inflammatory syndrome that over 100 children have recently been diagnosed with, including dozens across 15 states in the US.

Dr. Jake Kleinmahon, a pediatric cardiologist at Ochsner Hospital for Children in New Orleans, where Juliet was treated, told CNN that her case of the syndrome was a result of her immune system overreacting to the coronavirus, and causing inflammation throughout the body.

She ""was about as close to death as you can get,"" Kleinmahon said.

Juliet was on a ventilator for four days, and left the hospital on May 15, according to TIME.

Juliet's did not initially have the breathing problems most adults have with COVID-19. Instead she had stomach pain and vomiting, and her lips turned blue.

""I really didn't understand how serious it was but I was scared,"" Juliet, the first child to talk to the press about the experience of the new multisystem inflammatory syndrome, told CNN.

There are plenty of unknowns about the new syndrome, which bears similarities to Kawasaki disease, a little-understood inflammatory disease that predominantely strikes children, and seems to be triggered by a virus or bacterial infection.

The new syndrome has similar symptoms to Kawasaki, like fever and rash. Doctors have also recorded swelling of hands and feet, swollen lymph glands in the neck, and irritation and inflammation of the mouth, lips, and throat.

Some doctors are theorizing that having coronavirus can trigger the immune system's overreaction, and one recent study done by doctors in Bergamo, Italy, found a ""strong association"" between the two conditions.

The disease can be treated with high doses of aspirin or an IV drip of gamma globulin. Without treatment, 15 to 25% of people with disease will develop thinning or bulging of the walls of the arteries that supply blood to the heart, which can be fatal, according to the US National Library of Medicine.

At least three children in New York have died from the syndrome, and states like Kentucky and Michigan are also reporting cases. The CDC has published a health advisory warning doctors to look out for the symptoms.",real

Amazon Prime Air’s mechanical design and hardware teams adapted the design for the shields from the Washington State 3D Face Shield Hub, upgrading the shields to be more comfortable and the design more practical based on feedback from medical professionals. The new design, for instance, has fewer sharp corners that could snag on hair or clothing and a headband that reduces the amount of pressure on the user’s forehead.

The face shield design has been approved by the NIH

“When you think of Amazon you don’t naturally think of hardware design,” Amazon vice president of robotics Brad Porter wrote in the blog post. “But many teams across the company specialize in this discipline.” The company repurposed its manufacturing facilities, Porter wrote, converting a machine normally used to cut material for making drones into one that cuts screens for the face shields.

Sales of the face shields will be restricted to frontline workers at first, Amazon said, but the company expects to sell them “at a significantly lower price” than others on the market, Porter wrote. The design has been approved by the National Institutes of Health and should be for sale on Amazon soon, the company said.

Amazon also produced an open-sourced design package for both 3D printing and injection molding to allow anyone with the equipment to make their own shields. The company says it has donated 10,000 shields already.

Amazon did not respond to an email from The Verge asking whether it planned to provide the face shields to its own workers. Many of Amazon’s warehouse workers have complained that they haven’t been given enough personal protective equipment to prevent the spread of the coronavirus in their workplaces.",real

The spread of the coronavirus is dominating the news and has halted pretty much all of North American sports.

But talking about soccer — and sports in general — can be a pleasant and worthwhile distraction that allows fans to shift their minds to something more fun. That’s something Fire TV analyst Tony Meola is witnessing from his role on SiriusXM FC’s ‘‘Counter Attack.’’

‘‘Our talk on the radio is just hopefully to give people a couple of hours of an opportunity to listen to something, if they have the time, to get away from everything that you see on TV,’’ Meola told the Sun-Times. ‘‘There are still soccer stories there. People still want to know how teams are getting on and how they’re dealing with all of this.’’

In late March, the soccer chatter should be about the exploits of national teams as they prepare for their next tournaments or qualifying for a big event. European leagues are hitting their crescendos as spring approaches, and the season is just getting started in the United States.

But thanks to the coronavirus, news stories are different. The questions are about whether European leagues can award trophies and how those seasons can finish. In the United States, the Major League Soccer season has been paused and the Fire still are waiting to make their return to Soldier Field.

Of course, there aren’t any games to discuss and most news developments are related to the pandemic. ‘‘Counter Attack’’ is using the time without matches to look back at the first 25 years of MLS. And Meola, a U.S. soccer luminary who was the starting goalie in two World Cups, is grateful for the ability to talk soccer in this unprecedented and scary situation.

‘‘It’s definitely a nice diversion from what we’re doing personally here every day,’’ he said. ‘‘There are not many people that have the outlet to really enjoy very much. I love the game so much. I love knowing what’s going on in the world of soccer.’’

The games eventually will return, and Meola eventually will get back to talking about what’s happening on the field. He’ll be able to analyze how the Fire are doing under coach Raphael Wicky and whether all their new acquisitions are coming together in what is an incredibly important season for the franchise.

His voice, already known from his career in soccer broadcasting, eventually will feel more familiar on the Fire’s WGN-TV and ESPN+ broadcasts. Meola also will get back to working with frequent partner and Fire play-by-play announcer Tyler Terens, then with Arlo White when his schedule allows.

When that’s happening is unclear. Meola, however, is eager for the restart.

‘‘I can’t wait to call a live game,’’ Meola said. ‘‘I can’t wait to analyze a Champions League game on the radio. I can’t wait to get back in the booth and do a Fire game, an MLS game. That’s the most fun you have in this business. I’m looking forward to that day.’’",real
491,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/over-70-of-tested-inmates-in-federal-prisons-have-covid-19,2020-04-29,Over 70 percent of tested inmates in federal prisons have COVID-19,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Michael Fleming never got to say goodbye to his father. He didn’t know his dad was fading away on a ventilator, diagnosed with coronavirus at the federal prison where he was serving time for a drug charge.

His father, also named Michael, was held at FCI Terminal Island in Los Angeles and died April 19. At least half the population there has tested positive, the largest known hot spot in the federal prison system. But the first word the family received of the father’s illness was the day he died, from a prison chaplain asking if the body should be cremated and where the ashes should be sent.

“They just left us all in the dark,” Fleming said in an interview with The Associated Press. “We had to find out from the news what the actual cause of death was. It was kind of screwed up.”

WATCH: How prison has shaped one artist’s view on social distancing

The response from the federal Bureau of Prisons to the growing coronavirus crisis in prisons has raised alarm among advocates and lawmakers about whether the agency is doing enough to ensure the safety of the nearly 150,000 inmates serving time in federal facilities.

And even though officials have stressed infection and death rates inside prisons are lower compared with outside, new figures provided by the Bureau of Prisons show that out of 2,700 tests systemwide, nearly 2,000 have come back positive, strongly suggesting there are far more COVID-19 cases left uncovered.

At the same time, the Bureau of Prisons communication policies are leaving families in the dark about their loved ones’ potentially life-threatening condition.

The 59-year-old Fleming had been serving a 20-year sentence on a drug conspiracy charge. The Bureau of Prisons never notified Fleming’s family that he was taken to a hospital or when his condition declined.

“Not having the opportunity to say goodbye — that would’ve been invaluable,” the younger Fleming said. “We will never have that chance.”

Under Bureau of Prisons policy, the agency is supposed to “promptly” notify the family of inmates who have serious illnesses. But the agency, which confirmed the family wasn’t initially notified, has “discretion when making notifications,” according to a spokeswoman.

Prisons officials say they are doing the best they can under dire circumstances and following guidelines set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

“We are doing the right things to manage our population and to keep them as safe as possible at this time when we can’t provide that assurance to our average American free public that everyone is safe and secure right now with this pandemic,” said Kathy Hawk Sawyer, a senior adviser at the Bureau of Prisons who previously ran the agency twice.

As of Wednesday, 30 inmates, including Fleming, had died of the coronavirus at federal correctional facilities since late March. About 600 have recovered.

Prisons officials have daily calls with CDC officials, and CDC teams have visited several correctional facilities. As part of the plan to slow the spread of the coronavirus, officials have limited inmate movement, set up tents to increase bed space, isolated inmates at some prisons and identified others for possible home confinement.

The Justice Department obtained 20 ventilators for use at hospitals housing federal prisoners, Dr. Jeffrey Allen, the bureau’s medical director, said in an interview.

In the last week, the Bureau of Prisons has obtained more than 5,000 test kits and now has 20 rapid testing machines deployed at hot spot prisons to increase testing numbers, Allen said.

He insisted that testing was in line with current CDC guidance and that officials are working daily to discover new strategies to slow the spread of the virus.

“A lot is yet unknown about how to limit its transmission in a correctional environment, and that’s why we’re collaborating with the CDC to try to identify that sort of data that can inform our management strategies going forward,” he said.

But at the Metropolitan Detention Center, a federal lockup in New York City housing 1,700 inmates, there were only nine nasal swab test kits late last month, according to a lawsuit filed on behalf of hundreds of inmates there. Just one inmate has been confirmed with coronavirus there, according to Bureau of Prisons statistics.

Deirdre D. von Dornum, attorney-in-charge of the Federal Defenders of New York in Brooklyn, said there was a reason.

“They are not testing anyone,” she said.

At the Metropolitan Correctional Center, the New York City jail where Jeffrey Epstein killed himself, inmate Guillermo Zegarra-Martinez told his attorney in an email that his cellmate tested positive for the coronavirus and was put in isolation for more than two weeks.

But Zegarra-Martinez was not tested even though he was shaking in his cell with a fever during nights while experiencing pain throughout his body in the week before his cellmate was taken out and the week after, the inmate wrote.

The sick inmate was taken out of the cell only “because he was coughing on the face of the guy” who took his temperature, Zegarra-Martinez said, according to his lawyer, Sabrina Shroff.

Advocates and even prison guards have been calling for reforms to head off outbreaks in a prison system plagued for years by violence, misconduct and staffing shortages. Nearly 350 staff members have tested positive.

Staff are sent around the country to pick up shifts, and union officials say the shortages are still so severe that officers are sometimes working 24 hours in a row. At a prison in Elkton, Ohio, where seven inmates have died, the governor called in the National Guard to help supplement medical staff.

Officers worry that the protective equipment they’ve been given isn’t adequate to protect them from daily contact with inmates, especially at facilities where dozens have tested positive.

But Hawk Sawyer said the Bureau of Prisons is prepared with ample amount of personal protective equipment and supplies, including soap and disinfectant.

“We are creating and making the masks for the staff, as well as the shields and hand sanitizer and all kinds of things,” she said.

A new bill has been introduced into the 116th Congress (2019-2020) of the U.S. House of Representatives named H.R.6666 - COVID-19 Testing, Reaching, And Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act, with the potential to further the loss of the already vanishing health freedoms of each and every citizen of the United States. You can stand with us today by opposing H.R.6666 now (use this link to Take A Stand)

H.R. 6666, despite having been introduced by Rep. Bobby L. Rush [D-IL-1] and referred to the Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on the same day almost two weeks ago on 5/01/2020, has received little mainstream media coverage to this date, other than recent attempts to debunk claims that it would further violate the rights of Americans. As of 5/14/2020 is has 59 co-sponsors, including one Republican, indicating the potential that it may gain greater bipartisan support unless strongly opposed.

H.R. 6666 authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Director of the CDC, to allocate a 100 billion dollars, annually (or until the national COVID emergency is declared over), to employ, train, and deploy an immense workforce of “testing and contact tracers” to be sent directly to everyone’s homes for diagnostic testing and tracing of contacts suspected to have been infected or are at risk of infection with COVID-19. The bill uses broad yet highly vague language to describe the role of this veritable army of new agents of the emerging U.S. medical police state “for other purposes,” such as “support the quarantine of such contacts.”

The nebulous language of H.R. 6666 affords the government and public and private grantees under its coordination unusually broad discretion to apply its newly granted police powers under the presently defined “national COVID health emergency.” Since the national lockdown began on March the 15th, we’ve witnessed the near complete suspension of most of our Constitutionally irrevocable civil liberties, with the near complete cessation and/or modification of all socio-economic activity within the country. Moreover, executive orders have already been enacted throughout this country enabling the forced seizure of body tissue and fluids, property, forced vaccination, testing, isolation, quarantine and arrest without due process. While not all of these draconian regulations have yet been implemented en masse, they exist in the letter of the law and therefore could be enforced, especially given that bills such as H.R.6666 use broad discretionary language leaving it to the government to intepret its meaning and apply force as it sees fit. If H.R. 6666 passes, real ""teeth"" would be put to many of the laws, acts, orders, and regulations that have been passed as executive orders over the past two months, potentially locking the entire country into an irreversible control grid the likes of which we have not seen outside of countries like China.

In light of this, H.R. 6666 may be setting the stage for the implementation of what WHO director Dr. Mike Ryan of the WHO and Ventura County California officials, say will include forcibly removing family members found positive or suspected of being infected. The only way to prevent this is to make sure the bill is opposed and dies.

Eligible recipients of funds include “faith-based” and “school-based” institutions, implying that these organizations might also become, in part, testing or treatment centers.

What is Contract Tracing?

Take a few minutes to watch the important reports by independent journalists Spyro Skouras and James Corbett on the contact tracing agenda in the rapidly unfolding story of coronavirus.

Contract tracing, which on the surface appears to mitigate the risk of disease spread by identifying carriers and interfering their further contact with the healthy, is based on a series of flawed assumptions:

The disease known as COVID-19 and believed to be caused by a singular infectious disease entity, i.e. the viral particle known as SARS-CoV-2, has never been validated through Koch postulates to be inducible and solely caused by SARS-CoV-2 within a controlled clinical or experimental setting. Over 100 different types of coronavirus have already been identified in circulation naturally around the world, and there is serious doubt that we can adequately distinguish between natural extracellular vesicles such as human exosomes and novel or endogenous forms of coronovirus already present in the human virome with the tests being used today, namely, RT-PCR. Learn more about this at www.questioningcovid.com That so-called “positive cases” identified through any number of over 100 different PCR-based and antibody-testing methods are accurate indicators of the presence of COVID-19, or do not generate false positives. If false positives are not accounted for, contract tracing can cause or contribute to a falsely expanding epidemic and those who are unnecessarily quarantined and treated will succumb to greatly elevated iatrogenically induced morbidity and mortality risks, which will never be discovered because the so-called “confirmed case fatality rates for COVID-19” require no viral testing, and only “suspicion of infection.” This is because the WHO and US Vital Statistics agencies explicitly advise against confirming these suspicion-based deaths through viral testing and other clinical means, in an egregious departure from both science and evidence-based medicine.

If contact tracing is fraught with technical inadequacies, why would it be so aggressively implemented nationwide? One reason is that it provides a justification for total spectrum dominance via real-time surveillance and control of the entire population under the auspices of “public health safety,” into perpetuity. In essence, it is like a new “war on terror,” but with the enemy being defined as our own bodies, or contact between bodies, and the solution the complete removal of any privacy, nor right to exempt oneself or children from medical mandates. The system would likely include tracking GPS data of mobile device users and then following back their contacts to identify, test, isolate, quarantine, medicate, or otherwise vaccinate them when one becomes available most likely in the fall of 2020. The media has already fomented profound fear through misreporting, misrepresenting, and catastrophizing case fatality projections, over the past few months. Their egregious disregard for the truth has lead to socioenomic and psychobiological impacts that are arguably orders of magnitude more harmful and deadly than this, or any other virus believed to contribute to flu-like illness. Clearly, the media and power that be could re-manufacture another crisis, or “second” or “third” wave simply be repeating what they have already one (learn more on the topic via the Corbett Report). At which point, with an army of contact tracers, testers, quarantine enforcers, and medicators and vaccinators, the systems being funded by H.R. 6666 would be ready to further this agenda.

So, why does H.R. 6666 refrain from providing even the most rudimentary details to how one of the largest and most widespread in impact bills ever introduced will impact those affected? The more vague and broad the language, the less oversight. The truth is that the detailed plans for how H.R.666 will be implemented were already written and revealed to the public a month ago by the Rockefeller Foundation in a 30-page plan titled, “NATIONAL COVID-19 TESTING ACTION PLAN:Pragmatic steps to reopen our workplaces and our communities.” Not coincidentally, the plan proposed the exact same dollar figure was required - 100 billion dollars -- and suggested that between 100-300,000 contract tracers would be needed.

834,https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/2020/5/12/21251998/coronavirus-international-nurses-day-michelle-latona-mount-sinai-hospital,2020-05-12,"Nurses: Tough, tender pros who love their jobs","Michelle Latona is no hero. She’s a nurse, in the emergency department at Mount Sinai Hospital.

Latona certainly doesn’t consider herself heroic.

“No, I don’t,” she said. “I wake up every morning and I come to work and do my job.”

A job that demands she tend to the sick and the dying for 12 hours at a stretch. To juggle patients, rooms, medicines, doses, equipment, colleagues, hours, breaks, all the time keeping focused on the central task: making people well again.

“We’ve been saving lives the entire time,” she said, admitting that since the COVID-19 pandemic hit Chicago in mid-March, things have changed.

“This is a different time,” she said. “But I’ve continued to show up to work and do what I do.”

Latona never knows what’s coming through the door.

“This is a trauma center,” she said. “We still have gunshots, car accidents. Kids still fall off bunk beds. Now there are extra precautions. We have to go under the assumption that everyone is positive until they’ve proven negative. The COVID adds a little bit of extra stress.”

That “little bit of extra stress” has to be heroic, the modesty of the truly courageous, since most folks feel extra stress going to the supermarket, never mind having to intubate COVID-19 patients in an ongoing worldwide crisis hitting nursing much harder than most professions.

Nurses are the tip of the spear. The National Nurses Union reports at least 50 nurses have died in the United States from the coronavirus, and some 10,000 have been sickened by it. The only reason the death toll isn’t higher is because nurses tend to be younger, and fitter. Latona says her main hobby outside the hospital is working out.

She is one of almost 4 million registered nurses in the United States. Since Tuesday is International Nurses Day, it’s worth mentioning that there are 20 million nurses in the world, according to the World Health Organization.

If you haven’t heard of International Nurses Day, that isn’t because it’s new — the celebration began in 1965. It’s on May 12 because it’s the birthday of British nurse Florence Nightingale, who was in charge of nursing in military hospitals in Turkey during the Crimean War. Like nurses ever since, she had to overcome hostile doctors, who at first would not allow the new female nurses in the hospital wards. And like today, Nightingale battled obstinate authorities to get desperately-needed equipment, which she often dug into her pocket to pay for. Nightingale shrugged off attempts to honor her after the war, taking the collection grateful Londoners had taken up for her benefit and using it to found a nursing school in 1860, the first in the world.

Asked what she likes most about nursing, Latona replied:

“Our team here, we have such a strong team. We’re like family. We’re showing up. We’re picking up extra shifts. We’re filling in holes where we need to. We’re helping each other so much.”

Pandemic hits home

Latona grew up in Bensenville, her father a Mexican immigrant. Before she worked at Mount Sinai, she worked at a clinic for underserved patients. “I just really enjoyed working with that population,” she said. “Low-income, uninsured, immigrants with no paperwork. I could relate. Just because they’re here doesn’t mean they don’t deserve to be cared for.”

Her husband is a lawyer, and they have three young children: two boys, Theodore and Benjamin, 6 and 3, and a girl, Victoria, 22 months.

“My oldest always says, ‘Do you have to go to work?’ I say, ‘Yes, I have to go help sick people.’ He’s said, ‘Mom, I want to go to work to help sick people.’ He understands. All the kids understand when I come home, nobody can touch me until I take a shower.”

Latona feels safe, feels confident coming home to her husband and children.

“I do,” she said. “We feel comfortable. We’re taking the proper precautions. My kids are all really healthy, we have no preexisting conditions. My husband said, ‘Do you want to quarantine in a hotel?’ and I said, ‘Who knows how long I’ll be gone?’ ”

Victoria is named after her mother, “probably my best friend, probably the strongest person. I know.”

“She was a huge caregiver for my kids,” said Latona. Then her mother was diagnosed with COVID-19.

“She got sick back in March, right when this took off,” Latona said. “She was intubated, in the ICU for three weeks.”

Being a nurse, Latona knew what being intubated meant: About 90% of people who go on ventilators don’t survive.

“The worst part was, she was alone. I couldn’t go to the hospital with her,” Latona said. “She is in the ER by herself. She calls me and says, ‘They want to intubate me.’ I immediately started crying, because I knew what that meant. I hung up thinking, ‘Was that the last time I talked to my mother?’”

Latona had to care for everyone but the one person she most wanted to care for.

“It was definitely hard to come to work, seeing everything here; trying to focus, trying not to think of my mom,” said Latona. “I want to be present and care for my patient. Especially knowing what my mom is going through.”

Her mother is off the ventilator and recovering; in an odd way, her getting sick made her daughter an even better nurse.

“The fact my mom is by herself, it makes me more empathetic and understanding of the stress family members are feeling, the panic they are having,” Latona said. “Sometimes we’ll get phone calls from the family, and before you might feel, ‘We’re trying to do work!’ Now there is realization: They’re scared. I completely get it. The patient is scared. The family is scared they can’t be there, and they don’t know what’s going on.”

Second career

Latona wasn’t one of those girls who grew up bandaging her dolls and taking their temperature. Nursing wasn’t on her radar.

“It was actually a second career for me,” she said. She went to Illinois State, studied marketing, soon found herself wrangling the Shrek toys that went into McDonald’s Happy Meals.

“I was thinking: ‘What did I accomplish today?’ I felt very unfulfilled, not happy with it. I was thinking: ‘I want to do something to help people.’ I always liked science, and I always liked people. I was having a conversation with my mom, and she said, ‘I wish I had gone to nursing school.’ That got me thinking that’s the route I want to go. I went to nursing school.”

And what part of nursing is more fulfilling than marketing?

“All of it,” she replied. “In the emergency room you learn something new every day. You never feel stagnant. You ask, ‘What can I do?’ and there is always something to improve on, something to learn. The fun part of medicine is you’re never done learning what you can do better.

“We are such a family here. If you see somebody struggling, you go over to help them. ‘Give me something to do; what do you need?’ I never feel alone at my job.”

And COVID-19? Another chance for nurses to step up and shine.

“Even with everything going on personally, after all this started, I never called in [to take time off]. I felt I owed it to my work family to be here and help them.”

Five years into the profession, Latona has found her home.

“Something about nursing just called to me, and I’ve been very happy in that decision,” she said. “I don’t see myself doing anything else ever. You’re always learning something.”

Like Marines, like firefighters, there’s an annealed-in-flame quality to nursing. They’ve gone through the worst, together, which makes them strong, as a group and as individuals.

“It’s all pretty true,” she said. “We’re a tough group of people. We love our job. We see the worst of the worst. The ER is hard because we see somebody’s worst day, every day. We go from somebody passed away in that room, the worst day of that life, and we go in the next room, and that person is having the worst day of their life. That’s why our job is hard. It gets hard.”

Hard, though the job is not without benefits. The praise can be a little embarrassing. But the food is appreciated.

“We’re been very spoiled, lunch provided for us, really frequently,” she said. “We don’t think of ourselves as heroes. We’re just showing up doing our job. That said, we’re not going to say no to a nice lunch.”",real
1719,https://www.rt.com/uk/489522-court-rules-state-vaccinate-care/,2020-05-22,"Children in care can be vaccinated against their parents’ wishes without court order, UK judges rule","A UK appeals court has ruled that children in state care may receive “routine vaccinations” even when parents are opposed, adding that no court order is needed for the shots because they are in the child’s “best interests.”

Children in foster care may be vaccinated without a court order, against parental wishes, because vaccination is not considered a “serious medical treatment” that would justify High Court intervention, a three-judge appeals court panel ruled on Friday. Absent any “significant” or “unusual” reason a shot might not be in the child’s “best interests,” the London Borough of Tower Hamlets had full authority to arrange for a nine-month-old child in foster care to be vaccinated, the judges said in their decision.

The child was taken from his parents in September and placed into care after the government – which had previously removed children from the home due to the “parents’ chaotic lifestyle,” violence, and neglect – deemed his living conditions unsafe. While the parents had refused to have the child vaccinated, declaring the state should have no role in the raising of their son, they lost their initial case in February.

After an appeals hearing last month, the parents had already acquiesced to the state’s wishes, apparently seeing the writing on the wall and opting to allow their son to be vaccinated. However, the ruling is likely to have repercussions far beyond that case as the UK fast-tracks several Covid-19 vaccines to market.

Infant vaccinations are not mandatory in the UK, but the judges pointed out in their ruling that there was no precedent for a vaccination dispute being decided against inoculating the child and scientific opinion was largely settled in favor of the risks of not vaccinating outweighing any potential vaccine risks. Indeed, a 1989 law specifically categorizes the jabs as “preventative healthcare” rather than “medical treatment” and permits the state to arrange inoculations for children in care without consulting their parents. While parental wishes on immunization “must always be taken into account,” they can be put aside “unless the view has a real bearing on the child’s welfare,” the judges concluded.

The decision will likely have some parents up in arms, especially as the UK rushes various Covid-19 vaccines through trials despite a lackluster showing in clinical trials so far. Oxford University’s vaccine failed to prevent viral infection in any of the six rhesus monkeys that had been inoculated in its initial trial earlier this week, but the government dumped another £65.5 million ($80 million) into that project and human trials of the formulation will apparently continue despite the flop. On Thursday, drugmaker AstraZeneca said it had secured orders for 400 million doses of the unproven Oxford jab, with plans to start delivering it as early as September.

Also on rt.com The more you know? Over a third of Americans apprehensive about Covid-19 vaccine, citing rushed development & trust issues

The UK has an especially poor history with vaccines being rushed to market – the government is still paying out reparations for citizens injured by the 2009 Pandemrix vaccine, which hit the market during a swine flu epidemic after just six months of safety testing. The shot left over 1,000 people, mostly children, with permanent brain damage.

No statements have been made yet as to whether the coronavirus vaccine will be mandatory, but a significant minority of respondents to polls in the US and France have balked at both the rushed development timetable – vaccines usually take upwards of 10 years to go through clinical trials and safety testing – and their respective governments’ politicization of the process.

In 2009-2010, more than a quarter of a million people fell victim to the swine flu – a previously unknown strain of influenza that might have infected up to 21% of the planet’s population.

As the spread of the coronavirus has accelerated worldwide, many people have discovered or re-watched movies that look strikingly similar to the 2020 real-world pandemic. In Steven Soderbergh’s 2011 film “Contagion”, several people – from an unfortunate family in the American Midwest to journalists, doctors and government officials – find themselves in the midst of the outbreak of a terrible disease that suddenly starts killing millions. Freelance journalist, portrayed by Jude Law, describes the situation:

“On day one there were two people, and then four, and then 16. In six months – it’s a billion. That’s where we’re heading”.

Sound familiar? But despite predicting in detail some aspects of the current coronavirus pandemic (you have to watch the very final moments of the film to see the most obvious clue), “Contagion” was based on the 2009 swine flu and the earlier 2002 SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) outbreaks. The film’s crew consulted a top-level virologist to make depictions of the pandemic look more realistic.

It is believed that the new H1N1 influenza strain originally “jumped” from pigs to humans in 2008. Even though some US officials believed that the virus surfaced in Asia and was brought to North America by a human carrier, later studies pointed to factory farms in Mexico as its place of origin.

The symptoms of the swine flu included fever, headache, dry cough, and a runny nose. Just like COVID-19, it was a big threat for those with underlying health complications, but unlike the coronavirus, which is known to be less dangerous to younger patients, the swine flu was much deadlier for small children and pregnant women. Its complications included pneumonia and respiratory failure, with the patients’ conditions often worsening significantly within three to five days and eventually killing them.

Doctors used a variety of treatments – from antiviral therapy to antibiotics – to treat the disease. But an effective vaccine was needed to completely thwart the pandemic.

Major pharmaceutical companies in several countries entered the race to produce and test a vaccine against the swine flu and by the end of 2009, it was commercially available.

One year after the outbreak started, the US Centres for Disease Control was encouraging people to get vaccinated. Anne Schuchat, the director of the National Centre for Immunisation and Respiratory Diseases:

“Today I’m happy to say that we have a very good supply of the H1N1 vaccine all around the country. Many people have gotten the vaccine already, many more people want to get the vaccine, and we want people to get the vaccine”.

Just like the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918-1920, which neither originated in nor was the worst in Spain, the swine flu wasn’t a disease that was spreading from pigs to people on a regular basis. Despite its zoonotic origin – meaning that it passed the cross-species boundary from animals to humans, it was, just like other influenza types, spread through interpersonal contacts. At one point virologists even had to explain to people that eating pork does not put them in danger of becoming infected.

At the height of the swine flu pandemic, several countries, including China, Australia, Egypt, and Japan, imposed quarantine measures to prevent the spread of the disease by checking incoming travelers or locking down ships, hotels, and other facilities where outbreaks of the swine flu were detected. These measures, however, could not be compared to the scale and seriousness of the global coronavirus restrictions that have been seen around the world in 2020.

LONDON — When Boris Johnson was campaigning for Britain to leave the European Union in 2016 — a path that many experts warned would end in disaster for the country — one of his close allies, Michael Gove, famously declared that “people in this country have had enough of experts.”
Now, Mr. Gove and Mr. Johnson are leading the British government as it confronts the calamity of the coronavirus, and Mr. Johnson, now the prime minister, insists the process is being guided by experts. The trouble is, those experts can often disagree with each other or change their minds about the right course of action.
That messy back-and-forth has been on vivid display this week with the publication of a startling new report on the virus from a team at Imperial College in London. The report, which warned that an uncontrolled spread of the disease could cause as many as 510,000 deaths in Britain, triggered a sudden shift in the government’s comparatively relaxed response to the virus.
American officials said the report, which projected up to 2.2 million deaths in the United States from such a spread, also influenced the White House to strengthen its measures to isolate members of the public.
Imperial College has advised the government on its response to previous epidemics, including SARS, avian flu and swine flu. With ties to the World Health Organization and a team of 50 scientists, led by a prominent epidemiologist, Neil Ferguson, Imperial is treated as a sort of gold standard, its mathematical models feeding directly into government policies.
But outside experts pointed out that the report’s alarming conclusions — that the virus would overwhelm hospitals and that governments had no choice but to impose radical lockdown policies — had been made in previous reports on coronavirus or on social media sites devoted to the outbreak.
“A lot of it is not what they say, but who says it,” said Devi Sridhar, director of the global health governance program at Edinburgh University. “Neil Ferguson has a huge amount of influence.”
Imperial College, experts noted, was part of the advisory group for the government’s now-abandoned strategy, which played down radical social distancing and accepted that the infection would spread through the population. The theory is that this would build up so-called “herd immunity,” so that the public would be more resistant in the face of a second wave of infections next winter.
But such a strategy, the report noted, would lead to a flood of critically ill patients in a country without enough beds. Instead, it said, Britain needs to pursue “suppression,” which involves far stricter lockdowns, like the closing of schools and the quarantine of infected people and their families. That would drive down the number of cases and spread out the flow of patients over a longer period, allowing hospitals to cope.
Dr. Ferguson has been candid that the report reached new conclusions because of the latest data from Italy, which has seen a spiraling rate of infections, swamping hospitals and forcing doctors to make agonizing decisions about who to treat.
“The U.K. has struggled in the past few weeks in thinking about how to handle this outbreak long term,” Dr. Ferguson said in an interview on Monday, just after the report was released. “Based on our estimates and other teams’, there’s really no option but follow in China’s footsteps and suppress.”
The report added, “this conclusion has only been reached in the last few days, with the refinement of estimates of likely ICU demand due to COVID-19 based on experience in Italy and the UK.”
But other experts said the burden on hospitals was clear as far back as the original outbreak in Wuhan, China. Lancet, the British medical journal, published an article in January, based on studying a small group of patients, which found that a third of people had to be admitted to intensive care units.
“I can’t help but feel angry that it has taken almost two months for politicians and even ‘experts’ to understand the scale of the danger from SARS-CoV-2,” said Richard Horton, the editor-in-chief of Lancet, on Twitter. “Those dangers were clear from the very beginning.”
Some said governments should treat the report’s projections about suppression policies with the same caution. It says social distancing measures might have to be imposed for 18 months or more, at least intermittently, until a vaccine is developed and tested. But the report acknowledges this is uncertain, given the possibility of drug treatments and the mystery of how the virus is transmitted.
“We’re all using the 1918 pandemic flu handbook,” Dr. Sridhar said. “But we’re in a different position than in 1918. We’re in 2020.”
After days of confusion about the wisdom of encouraging “herd immunity,” the government sought to play down the dispute, arguing that this was not a deliberate part of its strategy but a byproduct of it. But it shifted to a policy of urging people not to go to pubs, restaurants, theaters or museums.
On Tuesday, the government’s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said he expected these new, more stringent restrictions to last for months — and that the authorities would have to monitor very carefully what would happen when they are eventually lifted.
British officials recognize that their health service faces a moment of truth. All non-urgent operations in England will be postponed for at least three months, starting April 15, to free up 30,000 beds to help tackle the coronavirus.
Britain lags behind other European nations in its supply of ventilators. Plans are underway to ramp up their numbers from over 8,000 to 12,000, though officials are reluctant to promise that even this is sufficient.
Underscoring the change in tone, Britain’s finance chief, Rishi Sunak, announced a gargantuan fiscal stimulus to salvage reeling British businesses and to try to stem job losses. The package, worth £330 billion, or $422 billion, will include government-backed loans and tax breaks for companies and a three-month break in mortgage repayments for strapped homeowners.
“We have never in peacetime faced an economic fight like this,” said Mr. Sunak, who also promised support for airports and airlines in the coming days, after Britons were advised against all non-essential travel.
Mr. Johnson hinted on Tuesday that schools could be closed soon. But he still faces criticism for a lack of clarity, including his decision to urge people to avoid pubs and restaurants but not to order their closing. In fact, the government now intends to relax laws to allow pubs to stay open and produce takeout food.
To Mr. Johnson’s embarrassment, one of those promising to visit his local pub was his own father, Stanley Johnson.Sheri Fink contributed to this report from New York.",real
1955,https://www.infowars.com/london-reportedly-set-to-cut-huaweis-role-in-development-of-5g-network-in-uk/,2020-05-23,London Reportedly Set to Cut Huawei’s Role in Development of 5G Network in UK,"A reported move to scale back a deal with Huawei has been interpreted in part as an attempt by the UK government to boost trade talks with the administration of US President Donald Trump ahead of Boris Johnson’s scheduled visit to Washington for the G7 summit in June.

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is planning to reduce the involvement of Chinese telecommunication company Huawei in the country’s 5G network rollout, according to the Daily Telegraph.

The move comes alongside plans by the United Kingdom to end its reliance on the eastern Asian country for strategic imports, including medical supplies, amid the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.

“He [Johnson] still wants a relationship with China but the Huawei deal is going to be significantly scaled back. Officials have been instructed to come up with a plan to reduce Huawei’s involvement as quickly as possible,” a source said, cited by the newspaper.

Johnson is reportedly intending to scale down China’s involvement in UK infrastructure to zero by 2023, according to the newspaper.

Downing Street has declined to comment on the report, according to Reuters. Huawei has not replied to a comment request by the outlet.

The report comes ahead of the prime minister’s scheduled June visit to the US for the G7 summit, according to the Telegraph.

Cutting Huawei’s involvement in the UK’s 5G rollout is also considered a step toward boosting post-Brexit trade talks with the Trump administration, which has consistently accused Beijing of being responsible for the coronavirus pandemic.

On Friday, The Times reported that Johnson had ordered Downing Street officials to prepare a plan to put an end to the country’s reliance on China for key goods. Two working groups, headed by Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, have been formed to carry out this job.

The aim of the effort, codenamed “Project Defend”, is said to pinpoint Britain’s main economic weaknesses and adopt measures that prevent attempts by “potentially hostile” foreign nation’s to use those apparent weaknesses to their own advantage.

London has defied significant pressure from Washington after previously announcing that the UK would, with conditions, allow Chinese telecom giant Huawei to assist in the implementation of a 5G network in the nation.

The UK government said that the Chinese company, which has been accused by the US of providing back-door access to Chinese intelligence services, would be excluded from certain “safety-related” and “safety-critical” networks.

Washington has repeatedly warned London that permitting Huawei to take part in developing the country’s 5G network would put the US-UK intelligence-sharing agreements at risk.

In May 2019, the Trump administration blacklisted Huawei over allegations that the company’s hardware and software connections sent data to Chinese intelligence agencies, amid trade tensions between the two economic powers that began in January 2018.

Beijing has repeatedly denied the accusations.

The US has also urged other countries to refrain from using Huawei equipment when adopting 5G network technology, as part of its pressure campaign on the Chinese tech corporation.

Safe to say very few of them had coronavirus in mind when they raised their right hand. By latest count, some 60,000 servicemen and women have been sent into action against this new enemy. But the military's number one mission has been to defend its own ranks against infection. It can't protect the nation if it can't defend itself. The aircraft carrier Roosevelt made headlines when the coronavirus ran roughshod through its crew. And there have been other outbreaks that required drastic measures to contain. The U.S. military was up against an enemy it could not see and did not understand.

Everything in the Army starts with basic training. And every day starts before dawn. But it never looked or sounded like this before.

Drill Sergeant David Castelow gives instructions for cleaning to prevent coronavirus. CBS News

Drill Sergeant David Castelow: Hard surfaces. Everything that your little hands touch. Everything! It's gotta get wiped down. Your beds – everything! If it's a hard surface it collects dust. You're gonna wipe it down. Do you understand?

RECRUITS: Yes, Drill Sergent!

It's not dust Drill Sergeant David Castelow is worried about. It's coronavirus. And that's why he takes every recruit's temperature first thing.

Drill Sergeant David Castelow: If your organization is infected by something like this, you know, these people, these initial entry trainees, are our combat power. So if they go down, or and if we can't do it safely, then we are rendering ourselves obsolete.

Coronavirus pandemic tests U.S. military planning

Last month, 63 recruits in a class of 940 here at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, tested positive for the virus and upended basic training.

Drill Sergeant Porter: You're going to do everything that I tell you. You do not move unless I tell you to.

That's not a recruit he's barking at. It's a four-star general, Army Chief of Staff James McConville.

Army Chief of Staff Gen. James McConville (right) goes back to basic training.

McConville took on the role of a recruit to witness the revamped training first hand after the coronavirus had forced the Army to stop taking in new soldiers.

Gen. James McConville: We took a two week pause.

David Martin: So for two weeks, you're not taking in any recruits?

Gen. James McConville: That's correct.

David Martin: Has that ever happened before?

Gen. James McConville: I'm not aware of any time – at least, in my 39 years where we stopped taking recruits in. But these are different times.

Training is still going on at Fort Jackson for recruits who arrived before the two-week pause. But now every soldier is wearing a face mask, loading up on hand sanitizer before moving into firing position and trying to stay six feet apart.

We call it ""social distancing."" The Army calls it ""tacticial dispersion.""

Lt. Col. Patrick Collins: We have been executing socially distanced enabled training since week 2.



Either way, Lt. Col. Patrick Collins tells Gen. McConville it's a problem.

Lt. Col. Patrick Collins: Day to day our biggest problem is keeping them in that six feet. Because, you tend to tell them, ""O.K. separate. Get your six feet."" You know, a couple minutes later, you know, just kind of natural human behavior. They start clustering again and you, and you, you've gotta tell them again.

Gen. James McConville

Nothing at Fort Jackson is natural anymore. The Army likes to say it has the best dressed soldiers in the world, but tailors who usually alter uniforms for a better fit are now turning out face masks.

Gen. James McConville: These just got here. These are brand new.

David Martin: Brand new?

And the single most important equipment McConville saw on his tour was a pair of high-speed COVID-19 test machines.

Col. Koenig: That'd give us the ability to test 750-plus in one day with a one-day turnaround. And then they go and we can then test that bubble also. We can continue to expand the bubbles of testing so that we can make sure we can cut it off right at the source, rather than watch it spread through a unit.

The chief of staff's job is to get the Army ready to fight. But these days, Gen. McConville told us he spends three quarters of his time trying to fight coronavirus to keep his soldiers healthy. Just six weeks ago he was sending heavy armor to Europe for one of the largest exercises since the Cold War.

Gen. James McConville: The toughest decision that-- that we had to make was to cancel Defender 20.

Defender 20 meant sending an entire division-sized force and its equipment to Europe, just as the virus was assaulting the continent.

Gen. James McConville: We just started war-gaming what would happen if we had 15,000 or 20,000 soldiers in a very close environment and, you know, and the virus broke out? How would we take care of them? And did we want to put our soldiers at that much risk for a training exercise? And we chose not to.

David Martin: You have to curtail training. You have to postpone major exercises. That's got to take a toll on the readiness of the Army.

Gen. James McConville: From where I sit, I'm looking at the long game, and the long game is that we have to protect the force to protect the nation.

David Martin: How big a price have you paid so far?

Gen. James McConville: I don't think we've paid a huge price yet. Am I concerned long term? Absolutely.

Brig. Gen. Pete Fesler

Brig. Gen. Pete Fesler: I'll be honest. It's been a little bit intimidating thinking about it. You train in your career to fight an enemy that you can see. This is one that you can't.

Air Force Brig. Gen. Pete Fesler, a fighter pilot, is about as far removed from basic training as it gets, underneath 1,500 feet of granite at this command post inside Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado.

Brig. Gen. Pete Fesler: It is a secure location that we intend to operate out of in wartime.

David Martin: Well, this is wartime, isn't it?

Brig. Gen. Pete Fesler: It is, but it's really a different kind of war.

Cheyenne Mountain was built to withstand a nuclear blast but every time a watch team makes this half-mile walk into the mountain, they risk bringing the virus with them. Which is why each team spends 14 days in quarantine before going on duty. When their watch starts.

Brig. Gen. Pete Fesler: The first step you do is you start wiping down every surface, your computers, your telephones, your desk surfaces, door handles, etc. to make sure that all those are clean as well. It's a bit like an obsessive compulsive disorder (laugh). But we have to be able to make sure that there's no exposure to that virus.

Because our 60 Minutes team had not been quarantined, our cameras were not allowed inside the mountain. This footage was shot by the military. The interview was conducted from the Pentagon.

Brig. Gen. Pete Fesler: When occasionally we have to bring somebody from outside into our bubble for work on an IT system, for example, we scatter like cockroaches. It's as if this is the most dangerous thing we've ever done in our careers. It's not being shot at. It's not flying combat. It's actually having somebody from outside the bubble arrive inside of here.

The command center at Cheyenne Mountain

This command center performs what Fesler calls a zero-fail mission: a 24/7 watch against a missile or bomber attack on the United States. Since the pandemic began, Cheyenne Mountain has scrambled jets to intercept Russian aircraft off the coast of Alaska three times.

David Martin: You think they were testing you at all to see if anybody was home at Cheyenne Mountain.

Brig. Gen. Pete Fesler: I suspect that the way that they look at those sorties probably is related to understanding our ability to operate in a COVID environment.

Cheyenne Mountain was ready for the Russians but not for the coronavirus.

Brig. Gen. Pete Fesler: This is something new. This is something that we had to invent on the fly as our adversary was not exactly like the one we had planned to fight.

Gen. Terrence O'Shaughnessy: There are so many aspects of what's going on now that are not things that we expected that we would be doing.

Gen. Terrence O'Shaughnessy

Gen. Terrence O'Shaughnessy, head of the U.S. Northern Command, is the man in charge of defending the homeland. He had plans for dealing with all kinds of disasters, including a pandemic, but nothing on this scale.

Gen. Terrence O'Shaughnessy: Often we practice what we call the complex disasters, where we might have an earthquake, maybe, that hit multiple states and we consider those to be complex. And to have a national-- actual disasters declared in the 50 states and the responses happening with them, that is unprecedented.

David Martin: So, you know the old saying about plans, no plan ever survives first contact with the enemy.

Gen. Terrence O'Shaughnessy: This plan did not survive contact with the enemy.

Despite all the top secret intelligence he sees, O'Shaughnessy did not have a good understanding of the virus.

Gen. Terrence O'Shaughnessy: Having an enemy that you don't fully understand is always a little bit frustrating.

Gen. John Hyten: We still don't fully understand the virus.

Gen. John Hyten

Gen. John Hyten is the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the number two man in the military. Twice each day he holds a video conference with the pentagon's crisis management team located two floors below in the national military command center.

Gen. John Hyten: We had so many assumptions of what a virus would do, what a pandemic flu would do. And then when you actually see what coronavirus does, what COVID-19 does, it's completely different.

The nastiest surprise was the aircraft carrier Roosevelt. Not only did the virus sideline one of the most important ships in the Navy but the majority of the more than 800 crew members who tested positive had no symptoms.

Gen. John Hyten: You think you finally start to understand it, and then you get data off the Theodore Roosevelt, of the very large number of asymptomatic cases. And then you try to understand whether the asymptomatic cases are contagious. How contagious are they? That's medical questions that we still don't fully understand the answers to.

Many of the answers depended on testing and the Pentagon had to use its transport planes to airlift millions of test swabs into the United States from Europe.

David Martin: From the outside looking in, it seemed like it was one emergency stopgap shipment of medical supplies after another. Was that what it was like on the inside looking out?

Gen. John Hyten: On the inside looking out I'll say it didn't look like an emergency but it was difficult. It was difficult to figure out exactly where to go. And then when we decided to move-- we had to move quickly to get it in the right place. But the one thing that we do really well is we move stuff.

The Army Corps of Engineers set up hospitals like this one at Chicago's McCormick Place Convention Center all across the country, creating by last count about 15,000 beds in case local hospitals were overwhelmed.

David Martin: Were those hospitals the last line of defense?

Gen. John Hyten: We looked at it as the last line of defense.

David Martin: Where would the medical personnel to staff all those beds come from?

Gen. John Hyten: I have to be honest, we were worried about whether we'd run outta capacity early on when we were lookin' at those big numbers. It was not just space but, we were worried about doctors, nurses, corpsmen, respiratory therapists. We were worried about all those things.

David Martin: If this virus had not been slowed by social distancing, would the U.S. military have had the capability and capacity to defeat that virus?

Gen. John Hyten: That's what we were worried about. A situation where we woulda been basically mobilizing everything we had. It would been a different world. And I can't tell you right now how we woulda closed that.

It's a question the American military rarely has to ask itself, but the definition of what it takes to be a superpower has changed forever.

David Martin: So what will it take to get the military back to normal?

Gen. John Hyten: 2019 normal will never exist again. We have to figure out how to operate and fight through a world where coronavirus exists.

British Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden has stated that it could soon be safe for the English Premier League to resume play amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

Speaking to radio station LBC, Dowden stated that a possible return could be sealed by June.

""We are hoping to get Premiership, Premier League, up and running from the middle of June, but clearly, in all of this, we’re going to be guided by the evidence and the public health. If we can be confident that we have met that and we are making good progress, then we would aim to do that”, the minister said.

The culture secretary also addressed the matter of whether the Championship, the second tier of English football, will be able to complete its season, and whether matches should be played behind closed doors.

""Well I imagine it would begin with the Premier League. I think the EFL might start with the Championship a little bit after that, but I should caution in all of this. We said that at the beginning, from the beginning of June would be the earliest. I think it’s more likely to be mid-June. It would be behind closed doors and we would only do it if it was safe to do so, so we are continuing those discussions but we are making good progress"", Dowden told LBC.

Football in the UK has been suspended since March due to the ongoing threat posed by the coronavirus pandemic and Europe’s professional football associations have until 25 May to report to UEFA, the continent’s governing body, whether they intend to press on with their seasons.

The Netherlands, France, Belgium, and now Scotland have already thrown in the towel and ended their campaigns prematurely, whilst England, Spain, Italy, and Germany are pressing ahead with plans to resume play.

A particular sticking point in the discussions between teams in England’s top flight has been the proposal to host matches at neutral venues, which many sides argue would deprive them of the valuable home advantage and pose severe logistical problems.

Premier League clubs are set to vote on whether the move to use neutral grounds to see out the season should go ahead later this week, after the ballot was called off last week over fears that the proposal could be shot down.

If the suggestion is ruled out, then only a few options for concluding the campaign remain viable.

These include rendering the season “null and void”, calculating the final positions based on mathematical algorithms, or simply ending the league with the current standings in place.

All of these scenarios could prove problematic to clubs in both the upper and lower echelons of the Premier League.

The Scottish Premier League voted to end their season prematurely earlier today, whilst enforcing league positions as they stood at the time of its suspension.

The decision is likely to be challenged by the bottom club Hearts, who feel that they have been unfairly penalised given the exceptional circumstances, and similar legal challenges could be brought forward by Premier League sides should they also be demoted in a similar fashion.",fake

""The last month has shone a light on some of the industry's practices that were previously barely tenable in the first place,"" Mariscal said in late April.

On Wednesday, Momofuku announced it would permanently close two restaurants: Nishi in New York City and CCDC in Washington, DC.

Other possible changes at Momofuku that Mariscal discussed in April include ending the tipped wage, recalibrating delivery fees, and diversifying business to make restaurants just one of many revenue streams.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Momofuku — a beloved restaurant empire that includes New York City's famed Momofuku Noodle Bar, upscale Momofuku Ko, and chicken-sandwich chain Fuku — isn't going to be the same when the coronavirus pandemic is over.

CEO Marguerite Mariscal told Business Insider that how Momofuku's mix of ""art and commerce"" translates in the ""next few months, a year, and beyond is still being written.""

""The last month has shone a light on some of the industry's practices that were previously barely tenable in the first place,"" Mariscal said in April. ""We are hopefully going to see a reform that will better position restaurants, even after there's a vaccine.""

Mariscal added: ""The worst thing a restaurant can do is go back to 'normal.' We need to all use this time to reevaluate industry standards.""

On Wednesday, Momofuku announced it would close two restaurants: Nishi in New York City and CCDC in Washington, DC. The company will also move the location of New York City's Ssäm Bar, combining the restaurant's staff with that of Wayō, which opened in 2019.

""Momofuku's guiding principle has always been that 'what got us here, won't get us there,'"" Mariscal wrote on Momofuku's website on Wednesday. ""Now more than ever, it is essential. This crisis has exposed the underlying vulnerabilities of our industry and made clear that returning to normal is not an option.""

Mariscal said in April that Momofuku was looking into changes included reexamining a tipped wage, which may no longer make sense when a larger percentage of revenue comes from takeaway. Delivery fees — which can be up to 30% of an order — may no longer be defensible as more customers order their food. And contactless delivery will somehow still have to inspire connection.

Mariscal said the pandemic has pushed Momofuku to diversify its business and approach restaurants as just one of multiple revenue streams.

""For us to take better care of our employees, we need to be profitable in and outside the four walls of a restaurant — whether that's through takeaway, products for the home, or content to cook along to,"" Mariscal said.

Chef David Chang. David Goldman/AP Images

Mariscal became Momofuku Restaurant Group's first-ever CEO in 2019, taking the reins of the company from founder David Chang. Chang has emerged as an outspoken advocate for independent restaurants during the pandemic, highlighting the difficulties restaurants face, both during closures and as they consider reopening.

""There's a good chance Momofuku may never reopen again, or the restaurant that you love to go so much in your neighborhood will never reopen again if we don't support the supply chain and the purveyors and the farmers and the workers all surrounding it,"" Chang told Vice in April.

Mariscal said she expected the restaurant industry to evolve but the fundamentals to remain the same. People still want to ""celebrate and commiserate with those we love."" The industry's financials and operations will simply need to evolve to meet that need.

""The north star will remain the same — have someone leave our spaces better than when he or she walked in,"" Mariscal said. ""But we'll just need to reverse engineer how we get there.""",real
35,https://www.worldhealth.net/news/new-compounds-fight-multiple-viruses/,2020-03-02,New Compounds Fight Multiple Viruses,"According to a report in ACS’ Journal of Medicinal Chemistry researchers have discovered compounds that are capable of blocking replication of similar coronaviruses as well as other disease causing viruses; but the compounds have not been tested in humans yet.

2019-nCoV is a close relative to SARS as well as MERS-CoV, all of these viruses cause flu-like symptoms as well as frequently leading to pneumonia, and there have not been any effective treatments developed as of yet.

Rolf Hilgenfeld, Hong Liu and colleagues are working to develop a broad spectrum antiviral that can target all coronaviruses as well as enteroviruses, all of which share similar protein cutting main protease enzymes in coronaviruses and the 3C protease in enteroviruses that are essential for the viral replication.

X-ray crystal structures of the proteases were examined which was followed by creating a series of a-ketoamide compounds that are predicted to fit in the enzyme’s active sites to interfere with their function. Test tube and petri dish testing identified one versatile inhibitor that blocked multiple coronaviruses and enteroviruses, as well as another molecule that showed strong activity against MERS-CoV with moderate activity against other viruses.

Due to the main proteases of SARS-CoV1, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 being very similar the inhibitors will likely have good antiviral activity against the Wuhan coronavirus, according to the researchers. The next phase will be to test these inhibitors in animal models of disease before eventually moving onto human testing.",fake

Disney, Universal, SeaWorld, Six Flags, Cedar Fair, Legoland and regional U.S. theme parks are expected to operate with social distancing-friendly attendance caps in place once they reopen following their extended coronavirus closures.

SEE ALSO: First U.S. theme parks set post-coronavirus reopening dates

Post-COVID-19 theme park capacity limits will vary widely by state and change over time as each locale gets the coronavirus outbreak under control. But most parks are expected to reopen with limits of 25% to 75% of normal capacity.

But what does normal capacity mean? Is that the fire code limit for the park? A theoretical maximum capacity? Or the average daily attendance?

Florida’s Orange County Economic Recovery Task Force laid out preliminary plans for a phased reopening of theme parks in the Orlando area once the coronavirus crisis begins to wane. The Florida task force’s initial recommendations call for Disney World and Universal Orlando theme parks to reopen at 50% capacity in Phase 1 and at 75% in Phase 2.

SEE ALSO: Analysts say park closures could cost Disney $27 million daily

California Gov. Gavin Newsom unveiled a four-stage plan for reopening the state economy that didn’t specifically mention theme parks and offered no details on what restrictions would be put in place when Disneyland, Universal and other parks eventually reopen their gates. No post-COVID-19 reopening dates have been set for Disney, Universal and SeaWorld parks in California.

The Shanghai Disneyland theme park in China reopened to visitors with advance reservations on May 11. Attendance was limited to 24,000 visitors — 30% of Shanghai Disneyland’s 80,000 capacity. New Disney CEO Bob Chapek said actual attendance at Shanghai Disneyland would start “far below that” and increase by 5,000 visitors each week with the Chinese government’s permission.

Shanghai Disneyland’s 80,000-visitor capacity is similar to Disneyland’s estimated capacity.

Disneyland’s capacity was approximately 75,000 visitors before the addition of Galaxy’s Edge and is approximately 85,000 when you include the new 14-acre Star Wars themed land, according to Touring Plans, which uses big data and statistical analysis to calculate daily theme park crowd sizes.

An attendance cap of 25% would bring Disneyland’s theoretical COVID-19 capacity down to 21,250 visitors. A 50% cap would work out to 42,500 Disneyland visitors.

“That’s why the phased ‘50% capacity’ guideline doesn’t make a lot of sense,” Touring Plans president Len Testa said by email. “That’s probably pretty close to how many people are in the park at peak time during an average day.”

Disneyland attracts an average of 51,000 visitors per day, according to the Themed Entertainment Association.

“But all of those people aren’t in the park at the same time,” Testa said.

Testa estimates 45,000 visitors are in Disneyland at any one time on an average day.

Disney California Adventure attracts an average of 27,000 daily visitors, according to TEA. Touring Plans estimates the capacity for DCA at about 50,000 visitors.

DCA could allow 12,500 visitors a day with a 25% attendance cap and 25,000 with a 50% cap, based on Touring Plans estimates.

The reality is that Disney theme parks rarely reach capacity. Disneyland occasionally halts visitors from entering when the park reaches capacity during the busy Christmas holiday season.

The Walt Disney World resort in Florida attracts nearly a quarter million visitors per day, according to TEA. Disney World’s average daily attendance per TEA: Magic Kingdom (57,000), Disney’s Animal Kingdom (38,000), Epcot (34,000) and Disney’s Hollywood Studios (31,000).

Much like their California counterparts, Disney’s four Florida theme parks have a theoretical attendance capacity far greater than their average daily attendance.

Disney World’s estimated attendance capacity according to Touring Plans: Magic Kingdom (90,000), Disney’s Animal Kingdom (60,000), Epcot (110,000) and Disney’s Hollywood Studios (60,000).

Initial recommendations from the Florida task force call for Disney World’s four theme parks to reopen at 50% capacity before increasing to 75%.

Theoretical Disney World COVID-19 attendance caps based on Touring Plans capacity estimates:

Magic Kingdom: 45,000 (50%) and 67,500 (75%)

Disney’s Animal Kingdom: 30,000 (50%) and 45,000 (75%)

Epcot: 55,000 (50%) and 82,500 (75%)

Disney’s Hollywood Studios: 30,000 (50%) and 45,000 (75%)

Calculating theme park capacity depends on two key factors: Open space and attraction capacity. A park like Disney’s Hollywood Studios might have room for 80,000 people, but only enough ride capacity to comfortably handle 60,000 visitors without wait times becoming excessive, Testa said.

“They don’t have enough rides or restaurants to support that level of attendance with reasonable waits,” Testa said via email. “So that’s what limits capacity.”

Disney officials, who declined to comment, rarely discuss visitor attendance or capacity.",real
128,https://www.worldhealth.net/news/covid-19-stable-hours-days-surfaces/,2020-03-23,COVID-19 Stable For Hours To Days On Surfaces,"Recent research published in The New England Journal of Medicine has found that COVID-19 is stable for several hours to even days in aerosols and on surfaces; it was found detectable in aerosols for up to 3 hours, up to 4 hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard, and up to 2-3 days on both plastic and stainless steel surfaces.

Scientists from the National Institutes of Health, CDC, UCLA, and Princeton Universities have discovered that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 can remain stable for long periods of time on surfaces and in aerosols. Their results may help to provide needed clues to the stability of SARS-CoV-2 which causes COVID-19, and suggests that people may be acquiring the virus through the air as well as after touching contaminated surfaces; this study has been shared widely after the researchers placed it on a preprint server to rapidly share their data with other colleagues.

The environmental effects of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-Cov-1 which cause SARS were compared. SARS-CoV-1 is closely related to SARS-CoV-2, and regarding stability both behave similarly, but this fails to explain when COVID-19 has become a much larger outbreak.

This study mimics the virus after being deposited from an infected person to common everyday surfaces in a household or hospital setting through coughing or touching objects, investigating how long the virus remains infectious on these surfaces. The scientists observed that the 2 viruses have similar viability, and that those infected may be spreading the virus without recognizing prior to displaying symptoms making control measures less effective. The stability of SARS-CoV-2 in aerosols and on surfaces is likely what is contributing to the transmission of the virus in any setting.

Their findings confirm the guidance issued from public health professionals for people to use precautions similar to those for influenza and other respiratory viruses to help prevent the further spread of SARS-CoV-2: avoid close contact with those who appear to be sick; avoid touching food, eyes, nose and mouth until your hands have been washed with soap and water; use a tissue to cover when you cough or sneeze and dispose of it into the trash; be sure to wash your hands frequently along with cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched objects and surfaces such as handles, door knobs, steering wheels, elevator buttons, ATM machines, store card terminals, stair railings, and counter tops among others.

1867,https://dnyuz.com/2020/05/23/the-drones-were-ready-for-this-moment/,2020-05-23,The Drones Were Ready for This Moment,"New Yorkers strolling along the East River early last month glanced up to see an unsettling sight: a mysterious drone claiming to represent something called the “Anti-Covid-19 Volunteer Drone Task Force” barking orders to pedestrians below to maintain social distancing.

“Please maintain a social distance of at least six feet,” the drone intoned, according to a report from CBS News, continuing with gloomy warnings, like “please help stop the spread of this virus” and “reduce the death toll and help save lives.”

It wasn’t a police drone. Was it a vigilante drone or an aerial white knight? Was it friend or foe?

That’s a highly relevant question about drones in general, which are suddenly everywhere during the coronavirus crisis, taking over any number of human tasks as people hunker indoors.

Drones have been working as police officers, soaring over the banks of the Seine in Paris and the city squares of Mumbai, to patrol for social distancing violators.

They’re delivering medical supplies in Rwanda and snacks in Virginia. They’re hovering over crowds China to scan for fevers below.

Coronavirus has been devastating to humans, but may well prove a decisive step toward a long-prophesied Drone Age, when aerial robots begin to shed their Orwellian image as tools of war and surveillance and become a common feature of daily life, serving as helpers and, perhaps soon, companions.

“Robots are so often cast as the bad guys,” said Daniel H. Wilson, a former roboticist and the author of the 2011 science fiction novel “Robopocalypse.” “But what’s happening now is weirdly utopic, as opposed to dystopic. Robots are designed to solve problems that are dull, dirty and dangerous, and now we have a sudden global emergency in which the machines we’re used to fearing are uniquely well suited to swoop in and save the day.”

First, however, we’ll have to get past the fears of an actual robopocalypse, with robots of the sky rising up to take over while their wetware-enabled former masters huddle in fear below.

Eye in the Sky

The origins of the “Anti-Covid-19 Volunteer Drone Task Force,” which turned out to be the work of a Queens drone enthusiast, may have confused New Yorkers initially, but in most cities, there is no question who is running the current aerial patrol. Law enforcement officials in cities and towns around the world have been using drones to scan parks, beaches and city squares for violators wandering into the safe spaces of others.

In China, drones have served as educators or enforcers, depending on your point of view, alerting citizens with unsettlingly folksy warnings about virus violations in robotic voices from above, as reported by CNN.

“Yes auntie, this is the drone speaking to you,” said one drone, speaking to an elderly woman below in an eerie bullhorn echo, according to a video published by Global Times, a state-controlled newspaper. “You shouldn’t walk about without wearing a mask.”

Global Times also published an account of another drone. A voice from above castigated a small child peering skyward while seated with a man who was violating quarantine rules by playing mahjong in public: “Don’t look at the drone, child. Ask your father to leave immediately.”

The idea of a government eye in the sky doesn’t always play so well in the United States, where personal liberty is a founding precept taken very seriously in many regions.

“Covid-19? More like Covid-1984,” read one recent Reddit post on a thread about police drones flying over encampments of homeless people in cities such as Fort Worth, and Chula Vista, Calif., blasting them with messages about coronavirus prevention. “It really feels like we are living in some dystopian science fiction novel,” read another.

“Did the drone fly over blueprints for a light saber?” another commenter fired back. “Not everything is a conspiracy.”

But automated oversight can be a blunt instrument. A police drone deployed in Fairfield, Conn., to monitor beaches for social distancing also warned a group of “juveniles” trespassing on the roof of a local elementary school, according to one news account.

In nearby Westport, police scrapped plans for their own drone project to scan crowds for fever temperatures, heart and temperature rates, and even sneezes and coughs, after outcry from the American Civil Liberties Union.

“The big concern is that the coronavirus crisis is going to normalize drones and entrench them in American life,” said Jay Stanley, a privacy and technology specialist for the A.C.L.U. “The fear is many of these incursions on freedom will outlast the crisis.”

While a drone itself is just a tool, neither inherently good nor evil, it is a tool with nearly unlimited powers for surveillance, Mr. Stanley added. Drones can be equipped with so-called stingrays to collect information from people’s mobile phones, night-vision cameras, GPS sensors, radar, lidar (laser detection technology for creating three-dimensional maps of an area), as well as thermal and infrared cameras.

Enough people distrust drones that “drone rage” incidents between drone enthusiasts and citizens who do not wish to be filmed from above have become a regular occurrence, Mr. Stanley said. One Colorado town even proposed a tongue-in-cheek ordinance in 2014 allowing citizens to shoot down drones invading their airspace, a proposal that itself was shot down by the F.A.A.

Resistance to pandemic patrol drones has not been confined to privacy watchdogs on the political left. On the right, outlets like Breitbart have also noted that many of the drones surveilling our cities are made in China, often by DJI, the world’s largest drone manufacturer, whose headquarters are in Shenzhen.

Some Republican officials have made the same point.

“Using drones, donated by a Chinese company, to spy on Americans during the #coronavirus pandemic?” read a tweet from the official House Judiciary Republicans account. “That doesn’t seem like a good idea.”

Drones have other uses besides snooping, of course. They have stepped (or soared) up as aerial virus blasters, with authorities in countries around the world — China, Dubai, Indonesia, France, as well as the United States — using them to sanitize city streets.

(It’s up to you to decide if government drones spraying cities for pathogens sounds creepy.)

Drones are also performing crucial roles on the medical front lines that may be described as humanitarian … if they were performed by humans.

“This is the moment when the drone industry gets to show what it can do,” said Miriam McNabb, the editor of Dronelife, an industry news site, and the C.E.O. of Job for Drones, an online drone services marketplace. “Things like drone delivery are lifesaving applications that are changing people’s perceptions of drones.”

Zipline, a San Francisco-based start-up founded in 2014 that airdrops medical supplies and ferries tests from more than 1,000 hospitals in Ghana and Rwanda by drone, replacing the need for face-to-face contact.

Zipline’s fixed-wing drones have already made 30,600 deliveries of medical products in those countries since the start of the pandemic, the company said: lately delivering cancer drugs, for example, to patients in remote villages who are unable to travel to oncology centers because of quarantine.

“Zipline are the heroes of drone delivery,” Ms. McNabb said. “In parts of Rwanda, where road infrastructure doesn’t support delivery, it’s either three days on the back of a motorbike or 15 minutes by drone.”

In the United States they are at last delivering more quotidian consumer items too, as long dreamed by Jeff Bezos of Amazon.

Last month, Wing, a drone-delivery service owned by Google’s parent company, Alphabet, received the first Federal Aviation Administration approval for commercial package delivery, starting in Christiansburg, Va., a town of about 22,000, which is near Wing’s testing facility at nearby Virginia Tech in Blacksburg. (Wing is also operating in Helsinki, Finland, as well as Canberra and Logan in Australia.)

Wing’s home deliveries of medications from Walgreens have proved particularly popular with quarantined seniors who are most at risk, said Jonathan Bass, a Wing spokesman.

“It’s one of the few emerging technologies that has attracted a lot of early adopters over the age of 65,” he said.

But Wing is also starting to out-Amazon Amazon, delivering must-have items like toilet paper and groceries. Merchandise is kept at a central Wing facility, and orders can be made through the Wing app, which allows customers to chart progress of their drone on a map, as with Uber or Lyft.

While useful for temporary shut-ins, drone delivery has served as a lifeline for small businesses dealing with a collapse in foot traffic.

“The first two weeks after Covid hit were rough; it felt like somebody put the e-brake on,” said Luke Brugh — conveniently pronounced “brew,” as he owns Brugh Coffee Co. in Christiansburg with his wife, Cassie. Wing, he said, has allowed them to double the sales of canned cold brew, which has helped make up for the loss.

And this may just be the beginning. Just as World War II hurried the development of emerging technologies like computers, rocketry, jet aircraft and atomic energy, the pandemic may speed the development, and adoption of, drone technology.

“Major world events can alter technological development cycles, causing them to accelerate or to slow down,” said Richard Yonck, the founder of Intelligent Future Consulting in Seattle and a former board member of the Association of Professional Futurists. “We’re seeing that now with drones and other automation in response to the pandemic. There’s a push to develop new tools that can reduce people’s exposure to the virus. What can we automate and by how much?

“Of course, this could also accelerate future job losses,” he said, “which is something we’d have to deal with down the road.”

Invading the Dream Factory

On a Tuesday night in April, a company called Verge Aero flew 140 illuminated drones in the sky above the University of Pennsylvania. The drones performed as synchronized points of light as they formed giant hearts, medical crosses and American flags, as part of the #PhillyShinesBlue and global #LightItBlue campaigns honoring health care professionals and other essential workers.

This 21st-century equivalent of a fireworks display was a case of drones serving to uplift, as opposed to, you know, simply lift — or spray, or fire missiles, or seize human jobs in an economy where unemployment is nearing Great Depression levels.

And it also may prove to be one of many examples of the pandemic helping to make drones seem more endearing.

During the lockdown, drones have also shown their potential as investigative reporters, bringing to light heart-wrenching stories like the mass graves for unclaimed bodies of Covid-19 victims on Hart Island in New York.

The footage was shot by a photographer, George Steinmetz, whose drone was confiscated by police for photographing the island without permission from the city’s Department of Correction. It was widely shared, illustrating the death toll beyond the statistics in Governor Cuomo’s daily briefing.

And at a time when professional storytellers — novelists, bloggers and many journalists — find themselves walled off to the global story around them, drones have pierced the veil of quarantine. They have created hauntingly poetic imagery of countless empty cities — San Francisco; Las Vegas; Wuhan, China — that says as much about loss in the coronavirus age as any written account.

“Drones sell this idea of emptiness, this lack of life better than anything,” said Dexter Kennedy, 29, a drone photographer in Hoboken, N.J., who has been shooting aerial footage of abandoned streets in Philadelphia, as well as the empty boardwalks of Atlantic City and Jersey City during the lockdown.

“You get 100 feet up and you can really see the big picture,” Mr. Kennedy said. “A boardwalk that would normally have thousands of people on it is totally empty. All the rides are empty. The Ferris wheel is not moving. You can see the grid patterns of the street, but no one’s out. It looks like an apocalypse movie.”

Mr. Kennedy, 29, is also the director of flight operations at Flying Monster, a drone production company that has shot footage for numerous television shows and films, including “Watchmen,” “Mr. Robot” and Steven Spielberg and Tony Kushner’s upcoming “West Side Story.”

Mr. Kennedy sees a big expansion of drone duties in Hollywood, should suspended productions resume with new social distancing measures in place. Drones can perform location scouting remotely, he said, minimize the need for crew members to share camera equipment and even allow a director to orchestrate aerial scenes from home, with a remote feed.

“Up to this point, drones have been kind of a luxury for Hollywood,” Mr. Kennedy said. “Now I think they’re moving into the ‘necessity’ category.”

As drones work their way further into the dream factory of Hollywood, they may also insinuate themselves further into our imagination.

We’ve seen it before. As the age of robotics dawned in the mid-20th century, popular culture churned out sympathetic, humanoid robots, like the Rosey the robot maid in the 1960s television show “The Jetsons,” or the robot in “Lost in Space,” which helped make an unsettling new technology seem friendly and approachable.

The boom to the drone industry during the pandemic comes at a point when drones were already poised to creep so far into our daily lives that techno-futurists are fretting about “robot smog” — drones as a new form of air pollution.

Developers have created drones as jogging companions, barking out encouragement to the sweat drenched, and someday, perhaps, pet sitters, if one IBM patent comes to fruition. Drones with human feelings, meanwhile, are a running gag in The Onion, as with the recent headline “U.S. Claims Drone Was Minding Own Business on Its Way to Church When Iran Attacked It Out Nowhere.”

If and when the pandemic ever ends, we may develop an unimagined kinship with our aerial assistants, just as we have with other types of robots.

“Soldiers in the field have famously anthropomorphized their robots — naming them, rescuing them, even holding funerals,” said Daniel Wilson.

Granted, he said, the marketplace has shown little interest in robots that do not perform valuable tasks. “It’s not enough for a robot to be cute or inspirational, it has to solve a problem before people will fall in love,” Mr. Wilson said.

Once the robot does, though, “the human mind will find a way to include it in the landscape of our lives,” he said, just as some supermarket employees have attached cute, googly eyes on the inventory robots they work alongside.

In a sense, they have no choice. As with drones in the age of coronavirus, Mr. Wilson said, “the robots aren’t going anywhere.”

Morgan logo is seen in New York City, U.S., January 10, 2017. REUTERS/Stephanie Keith/File Photo

(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) has given out more than $30 billion in loans to over 250,000 businesses as part of the United States’ coronavirus aid program for small businesses, Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said in a memo on Tuesday.

JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank, approved more than $45 billion in new credit for its clients impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in March and April, Dimon said in a memo to stakeholders.

Dimon said the size of the average loan under the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) was $122,000 and half of the loans went to companies with fewer than five employees.

The U.S. Justice Department has sent grand jury subpoenas to big banks seeking records as part of a broader investigation into potential abuse of a $660 billion emergency loan program to help small businesses hurt by the novel coronavirus, two people with knowledge of the matter told here Reuters.

Dimon, who has been CEO of JPMorgan for over a decade, also said the bank’s strategy for returning more employees to work on-site hinges on using the latest data and information and prioritizes the health and safety of its employees.

Following is a transcript of the video.

Pooja Tewari: This is not how I thought I would end college.

Daniela Beck: My school where I'm from has really been impacted by the virus.

Emma O'Brien: We expected something to happen soon, but we didn't know it would be this drastic so quickly.

Masha Pescheryakova: When my chancellor first sent out an email telling us that UCSB's going remote, I was shocked.

Hasumi Tani: Students who were off campus during spring break were essentially told to not come back to campus, and they were ordered to either stay or go back to their permanent address.

Daniela Dwek: Last week was my last time in the facilities.

Belkis Anane: School is closed. Students were instructed to evacuate and join their families. But I cannot, because I'm an international student, and I cannot leave because of travel bans.

Hasumi: As an international student, I do not have a place to stay here, and, currently, I'm in a pretty sticky situation. My visa was rejected this week, so I literally do not have a place to go back right now. And my only choice is to stay here in America, and hopefully Georgetown.

Preet Kaur: I have chosen to stay in Santa Cruz. This is mainly because if I am exposed to the virus and I'm asymptomatic right now, I don't want to go back to my parents' house and accidentally expose my family.

Huma Manjra: When I came home yesterday, I had a lot of paranoia around, I really just sat through a flight, I really just went through two of the biggest airports, and who knows what I touched, and I had this fear that, OK, if I come home, am I gonna give anything to my parents, am I gonna give anything to my older, like, relatives, like my grandparents? Being here in LA County, where the cases are soaring, and doubling and tripling with each day, is really heightening my fear.

Genevieve Korn: I may not be able to see my parents for an extended period of time. Due to their age, they are in one of the at-risk categories, and I'm very afraid that the next time I look at my phone someone I know and love will be gone.

Belkis: Few of us are left here, but everyone I know and care about is halfway across the globe. So it is definitely very hard to go through this on your own. Housing is not a problem because I already live off campus, but I believe it is a great challenge to see all of my roommates and classmates leave and join their families while I cannot do that. It is very, very hard to be productive and work online when you are very worried for your family, who's in a very serious outbreak.

AJ Yablonsky: The whole university is now pass/fail, mandatory. You can't even opt in to take letter grade, because for people who are going home to family situations that they have to take care of a loved one who's sick with this illness or, you know, provide for their family because someone might have lost a job, they can't worry about their grades right now.

Genevieve: No one knows what's happening. But in terms of the professors and the universities, they're doing the best they can. They don't know how to cope just as much as we don't know how to cope.

Emma: It is, you know, really difficult to cater to all of the needs of students online, and I think a lot of classes will struggle. We really rely on the student to professor contact and relationship, and I just don't think that's really possible online.

Amona Saleh: Having our classes being moved to online has definitely lessened the quality of our education. Like, my science classes, all of our labs have been just canceled.

Emily Herrmann: What really stood out to me is just how radically unprepared the education system was for this switch. I know of some professors in the humanities who didn't even use email before all of this went down.

Genevieve: There are a lot of students out there that are really feeling lost right now and really need a friend. And they need someone to talk to because everything they knew was ripped away from them in a set of emails.

Preet: A lot of extracurriculars on campus have also been totally eliminated. I personally do research in a lab, and I am not allowed to go on campus currently unless I have things that I need to keep alive.

Emily: I'm an athlete on the track team. Our entire spring season got canceled, which has been really tough.

Genevieve: An organization that I'm the president of, all of our competitions were canceled, which I understand why for the safety of everyone, I agree with that they were canceled. I cried a lot when I found out that all of the work we had put in for months and months and months wasn't gonna happen this year.

Pooja: I am in my final semester of college, I was supposed to be abroad, had that taken away from me. I'm supposed to be graduating, walking in May, and there's a chance my commencement ceremony could get canceled.

AJ: Today actually we just got an email that our commencement ceremonies have been canceled. It feels surreal. Like, it's... I'm not even, like, sad. And I know I should be sad and disappointed, and I guess I am to an extent, but it doesn't feel real.

Huma: Just having to pick up, you know, leave everything, has been very, it's been a lot for me to process.

Emily: Not getting to say goodbye to friends in person has led to a lot of really emotional FaceTime calls and texting calls just thanking them for being a friend for four years. And I should have said stuff before coronavirus happened, and I'm learning that.

Elizabeth Camele: I go through periods where I feel very angry about the situation, and I also go through periods where I'm just in shock. Like, I can't believe this has happened.

Emma: So, a high moment of this experience is, you know, just the sense of community and love and support.

Daniela: Going on Facebook, different pages have been really uplifting with other students and new graduates being in the same position. And it's making me feel a lot better.

Katrina Jackson: They're just a nice dose of humor and a place for all the students that are more or less my age to come together in solidarity and just laugh about things and provide support if things are more serious.

Daniela: Like, we're all in this together, and the class of 2020 will be remembered, for sure, with all of this. And we will be celebrated one day or another, even if it's months after this pandemic.

Genevieve: It's terrible. I may not get to have a graduation ceremony. I may not get to see some of my friends again, but in the end it hopefully will be because lives were saved.",real
418,https://chicago.suntimes.com/2020/4/23/21222853/dcfs-at-risk-children-foster-care-public-guardian-pandemic-covid-19-charles-golbert,2020-04-23,Watching out for Illinois’ most vulnerable kids becomes all the harder during a pandemic,"The novel coronavirus had disproportionally impacted some of our most vulnerable communities including seniors, people with health conditions, the poor, and minorities including African-Americans.

But how is it impacting at-risk children who are in the custody of the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services? How has DCFS been handing the crisis?

Opinion

First, the good news. Overall, DCFS has been doing a good job handling this unprecedented situation. These are some of the positive steps DCFS has taken:

DCFS has given guidance to its private agency partners, and has done so in a transparent manner. Every directive and protocol related to COVID-19 is collected in a prominent location on DCFS’s website.

About 85% of DCFS’s operations are being conducted remotely. This includes remote interviews of children, foster parents and other care providers. Even operators at DCFS’s child abuse hotline are handling calls remotely, from their homes.

DCFS is giving foster parents $100 supplemental payments for March and April, for a total of $200, due to the additional costs of caring for children who are at home instead of in school.

A coalition of advocates urged DCFS to provide services to assist youth and young adults who have recently “aged out” of DCFS or are about to age out. These youth, many of whom have special needs, are particularly vulnerable for loss of wages, mental health issues and homelessness. DCFS is extending services to these youth including assistance with housing, food, unemployment, mental health and medical care and casework support.

DCFS was scheduled to rollout a problematic managed care plan for all medical care for the 17,000 children in its care, many of whom have complex medical needs, on April 1. The rollout in February for 19,000 children who were formerly in DCFS care — children who have been adopted or are in subsidized guardianship — was a disaster, with some 2,500 children being dropped from their health coverage for up to a week and many other problems. DCFS agreed to delay the managed care rollout indefinitely due to COVID-19.

Although there is good news in DCFS’s handling of the pandemic, there’s a lot to be worried about:

Calls to DCFS’s child abuse hotline dropped by more than 50% since the shelter-in-place order went into effect. Yet there is every reason to believe that incidents of child abuse and domestic violence are up with families hunkered down and isolated at home under stressors that are associated with increased incidents of abuse such as worries about work, money, and health.

DCFS’s move to remote interviews of children was necessary to protect children, families, foster parents, DCFS personnel and the public. But remote interviews, especially of young children about sensitive topics such as abuse and neglect, are not as effective as live interactions. It’s just not possible to pick up on all of the child’s subtle body language and facial expressions. It’s also more difficult to monitor whether someone in the next room is coaching the child.

Most concerning, all of the systemic problems plaguing DCFS for years haven’t gone into abeyance because of the crisis. As just one example, DCFS is managing the coronavirus crisis with the sever shortage of placements for children that existed before. As a result, children continue to languish needlessly in out-of-state placements, in what are supposed to be emergency short-term shelters, and in locked psychiatric hospitals long after they are ready to be discharged, just like before the crisis. Only now it is far more difficult to monitor these children.

Regarding children who are in out-of-state placements, even before sheltering-in-place measures and remote interviews, it was difficult if not impossible to properly monitor these children and the quality of the faraway placements. In addition, even before sheltering in place, it was difficult to support visits with siblings, parents, and other family members in these faraway placements.

Regarding children languishing in locked psychiatric hospitals for weeks and months after they are ready for discharge, in addition to being antithetical to the children’s civil rights, these children are needlessly in congregate care settings with shift staff coming and going and new patients coming and going. These children are thus at needless increased risk of COVID-19 infection. This is a result of DCFS’s dangerous shortage of placements, a problem that DCFS has known about for years and which has gotten much worse over the past five years, during which DCFS lost hundreds of placements.

While DCFS has been doing an admirable job during the crisis, DCFS is operating under the many and severe systemic problems that existed before. Most all organizations, under these unprecedented circumstances, are understandably not running on all cylinders. But if they started with eight fully-charged cylinders, there are hopefully redundancies if a cylinder goes out. Unfortunately, before the pandemic started, DCFS was chocking along on only a few cylinders.

Children, like other vulnerable populations, will be disproportionally impacted by this crisis. When the crisis is behind us, Illinois must commit to meaningful reform of DCFS. Children are our most important asset, and they deserve better.

""When all this is over — and as we've said, it will end — we will get over coronavirus, but there will still be health disparities, which we really do need to address in the African American community,"" he said in an April 7 press briefing. Those ""disparities"" Fauci mentioned are linked to early numbers that show African Americans are disproportionately dying from Covid-19. In Michigan, black people make up 14% of the state's population, but account for 41% of coronavirus deaths, according to data released by Michigan's government. In Illinois, black people make up 14% of the population, but account for 32.5% of coronavirus deaths, according to the state's Department of Public Health. In Louisiana, where black people make up about 33% of the population, Gov. John Bel Edwards said in early April they account for more than 70% of the state's coronavirus deaths, with the majority of these fatalities taking place in New Orleans. And in New York City, black and Latino people are twice as likely to die from the virus than their white peers, according to data by the local government. All of these figures are based on the most recent data released to the public, with more states and local governments being pressured to share a racial breakdown of their numbers.

""There are definitely multiple reasons why we're seeing black communities be disproportionately impacted by Covid-19,"" New York-based physician Dr. Uche Blackstock tells CNBC Make It. She explains that when you look at the ""social determinants of health,"" such as where a person lives, works and the quality of health care they have access to, you will see that structural racism has left African Americans ""vulnerable and marginalized."" ""Even before this [pandemic], we had significant health inequities,"" she adds, while emphasizing the increased levels of diabetes, high blood pressure, hypertension, asthma and obesity in the black community. ""And what we're finding out is that these are the underlying medical conditions that result in very serious complications from Covid-19."" CNBC Make It spoke with Blackstock, along with five other black doctors, nurses and experts, to get their thoughts on how housing location, health-care access and distrust in the medical system have all contributed to the racial health disparities we see today.

Housing location and resources

Due to a history of housing discrimination and redlining, which is the systemic practice of refusing government resources to predominantly black neighborhoods because they've been deemed a financial risk, generations of African Americans have been forced to live in areas that lack access to healthy food options. Many of these neighborhoods, which researchers have categorized as ""food deserts"" are filled with fast food restaurants and small corner stores that have more junk food options than fresh fruits and vegetables. ""I think it's really important to understand that dietary choices aren't moral choices,"" says Chinara Tate, director of nutrition at Mount Sinai Eating and Weight Disorders Center of Excellence in New York. She explains that for many black and brown people living in poor communities, the food choices they make are made through a survival mindset, and they don't have the luxury of thinking about the long-term impact of their diet. ""If you have the option of purchasing an onion for a dollar or purchasing a meal for a dollar, it makes the most sense to purchase the meal, even if it's not the healthiest option because an onion is not going to feed your family."" As a result, residents in these communities tend to rely on high calorie foods that are cheaper and more accessible, says Dr. Jessie Marshall, an assistant professor of internal medicine at the University of Michigan Medical School. ""And we know that results in chronic diseases such as diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity,"" she says. ""So again, Covid-19 did not create these racial disparities that we are seeing. It simply magnified these disparities in unbelievable ways.""

Employment and health-care options

In 2017, 55.5% of African Americans had private health insurance, compared to 75.4% of white Americans, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. That same year, 43.9% of African Americans relied on Medicaid or public health insurance and 9.9% were uninsured altogether. This disparity in health care is linked to the employment of African Americans who, along with Latinos and Hispanics, are overly represented in low-income roles that often lack insurance and benefits for hourly workers. Today, 63% of Latino or Hispanic workers and 54% of black workers earn low wages, compared to 40% of Asian American workers and 37% of white workers, according to a 2019 report by the Brookings Institution, which found that even in these low-wage roles, black and Hispanic workers earn less than white workers with the same education level and experience. Low wages, according to the study, are categorized as jobs that pay a median salary of $10.22 per hour or $17,950 per year. Some of these roles include grocery store clerks, home health aides, fast food workers and other service sector jobs that have been deemed ""essential"" during the coronavirus pandemic. Not only do these roles require workers to work outside the home, but many of them also offer no paid sick or family leave. ""Anyone who knows the history of America is not surprised,"" says Belinda Archibong, assistant professor of economics at Columbia University's Barnard College. Despite the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibiting employment discrimination, she says black Americans still face racial and gender barriers that keep them locked out of top jobs. In situations where black workers have been forced to hold positions with little to no benefits, she says she's watched first-hand how they have ignored long-standing health issues because of the cost. ""I've seen my own family go through the fact that when you don't have health insurance you basically avoid the doctor until it's like a life-or-death scenario,"" says Archibong. For many essential black and brown workers, she says it may be common for them to not even know they have underlying health conditions because they don't have insurance to visit a doctor regularly. Therefore, if they get Covid-19, and it's paired with untreated health conditions, their odds of beating the virus could be low.

593,https://www.worldhealth.net/news/has-new-zealand-effectively-eliminated-covid-19/,2020-05-04,Has New Zealand Effectively Eliminated COVID-19?,"New Zealand has chosen strict lock downs and austerity but what is next, and what have they done to have virtually eliminated this coronavirus outbreak on their island nation, according to the nation’s leader.

""There is no widespread undetected community transmission in New Zealand. We have won that battle,"" Prime Minister Ardern said. ""But we must remain vigilant if we are to keep it that way.""

The normally very busy and active island is now basically barren in comparison since the outbreak, deserted highways are just one manifestation of their resolute response to COVID-19; under their stringent lock down orders lights are dark and patios empty at every pub, cafe, and business, while there is yellow police tape sealing off parks and playgrounds with swings and equipment being tied up and out of reach to ward off temptation, as well as trails have barriers with closed signs at their entrances.

The emptiness across this beautiful island shows that the residents here are following orders and there is not much risk of transgression other than an occasional jogger or a person out for a brief stroll to get some air. Everything is closed except a few paved paths to and from towns to get essential supplies.

Close to 4 million visitors travel to New Zealand to experience its picturesque splendor and wilderness landscape, that is approximately 80% of the resident population, but this outbreak has forced the country to close all of the sought after landscapes and its borders.

If there is a shiny spot amid the global responses to this outbreak, New Zealand just might be it. While other governments have been more than a little indecisive wavering between different opinions and actions on the best response allowing the ensuing cases of infection to soar, New Zealand has set an uncompromising science driven example.

The country banned travel from China on February 3rd and since then their trajectory of new cases looked out of control until mid March when their austerity measures seemingly have been able to bring the spread of COVID-19 to heel on the island nation.

On March 15 the country began mandatory quarantines on all visitors, the strictest policy at the time, and just 10 days later New Zealand instituted a complete countrywide lock down which included a moratorium on the domestic level. The level 4 restrictions meant that hospitals, pharmacies, petrol stations and grocery stores were the only commerce allowed to be open, vehicle travel was restricted, and social interaction was limited to within households.

The Prime Minister of New Zealand made clear, concise statements about the situation to the nation, and was bolstered by a team of scientists and health professionals to help stop any confusion or panic about the sudden austerity, while delivering and supporting the same message. She also announced a few days after the lock down that the country rather than just slowing the transmission of the virus had set a course to eradicate the virus by cutting off the arrival of new cases and choking out any existing ones with these restrictions.

“We must fight by going hard and going early,” Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said in a statement to the nation on March 14. “We have the opportunity to do something no other country has achieved: elimination of the virus. But it will continue to need a team of 5 million behind it.”

“The virus doesn’t have superpowers. Once transmission is stopped, it’s gone,” said Petousis-Harris, a vaccine expert at the University of Auckland, who suggests that the country had managed to avoid the confusion and half-measures that have hampered the response in many other countries. “New Zealand got everything right,” she said. “Decisive action, with strong leadership and very clear communications to everybody.”

Looking at New Zealand from the outside perspective it is rather different than the indecisiveness, confusion, and whinging being seen in America, in New Zealand the entire country simply got on board with the idea as it was clearly and concisely explained to them. In this country right from day one of their lock down the streets and highways were empty, stores were closed and everyone stayed home rather than complaining like entitled children having a temper tantrum.

Since their measures were put into place, they appear to be working as their daily infection rate in this island nation of 4.9 million people has been decreasing steadily from the maximum of 146 in March to just a few cases by mid April; in all New Zealand has reported a high of 1,476 cases with 19 deaths, and on April 26th, the country experienced no new COVID-19 cases and no community transmission for the first time in 6 weeks, but 7 new cases appeared on April 30, 2020.

Even with the 7 new cases the low numbers gave the government the confidence to ease up on the country’s social distancing restrictions to lower them to Level 3 at the end of April, and Ardern pronounced that the virus had been eliminated, she later clarified that “elimination doesn’t mean zero cases... we will have to keep stamping COVID out....” Downgrading to level 3 means that most but not all businesses are being allowed to reopen provided they follow safety measures, but all that require face to face contact must remain closed until level 2 is reached.

""Your business must be contactless. Your customers can pay online, over the phone or in a contactless way,"" she said. ""Delivery or pickup must also be contactless.""

Even though New Zealand is sounding fairly confident about eliminating this virus, the success is not guaranteed. For instance other countries such as Singapore that also appeared to have the virus under control have now been struggling with a second wave of infections, and in China which also appeared to stop the spread completely are now contending with a second wave as well.

If New Zealand has managed to contain this virus outbreak, the country will still face a long and hard road, as once they are virus free they will need to maintain the total halt on all arrivals from outside of the country or risk the chance of reinfection until the entire world has managed to snuff out the virus as well. For a country like New Zealand that is largely reliant on tourism in terms of foreign exchange earnings that accounts for 10% of the GDP and nearly 15% of their workforce that is a tough prospect. For the Kiwi economy this puts hundreds of thousands of jobs at stake, and it is forecasted that the country will be among the hardest hit nations, which may not recover until at least 2024.

Australia has also been experiencing a decline in their new cases since their peak a month ago, according to their home affairs minister Peter Dutton, New Zealand and Australia are at a comparable stage in their fight against COVID-19.

Recent surveys indicate that 87% of the New Zealand population support the way that their government is handling this crisis, and it may have been easier for citizens to fall in to tow the line in this country because in general the vast majority trusts their leaders. In New Zealand it is reported that the streets remain clean and quiet, public services are functioning, stores are well stocked, and the risk of contracting COVID-19 appears to be remote and diminishing with each passing day thanks to clear and concise leadership and the citizens cooperating by following guidelines to do their part in battling the outbreak.",fake

London will blare Islamic call to prayer during Ramadan as churches remain closed

The words in the Adhan state: ‘Allah is the greatest. I bear witness that there is no god except Allah. I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. Come to prayer. Come to salvation.’

By Paul Smeaton, May 19, 2020:

LONDON, May 19, 2020 (LifeSiteNews) – A London suburb totalling a mere 15 square miles in size and with a population of less than 300,000 people has granted permission for the first time to nine mosques to broadcast the Islamic call to prayer during Ramadan.

The news was published earlier this month in an article in The Metro, which included a video of the “Adhan” being chanted above from the roof of a mosque in Waltham Forest.

Waltham Forest is one London’s 32 boroughs, each of which has its own elected local council.

Clare Coghill, the leader of Waltham Forest Council, said that the Adhan being broadcast was “an alternative form of connection” for Muslims, with mosques currently closed along with all other places of worship in the U.K. as part of the nationwide coronavirus lockdown.

“Ramadan is normally a time for the Muslim community to come together to pray and break their fast,” she said.

“Like many aspects of all our lives, this has been affected by Covid-19 and the requirement to remain socially distant. As an alternative form of connection during this special month, the Waltham Forest Council of Mosques contacted the council to request that as an alternative to congregating they announce a short call to prayer at a number of mosques adapted to remind worshippers to stay at home,” she continued.

“The council considered the request as it would with any religious or faith group looking to responsibly worship during this difficult time. Ramadan Mubarak to all our Muslim community.”

The Adhan will be broadcast each day at sunset, with an additional broadcast each Friday. The words in the Adhan state: “Allah is the greatest. I bear witness that there is no god except Allah. I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. Come to prayer. Come to salvation.”

Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the senior Catholic cleric in the U.K., marked the beginning of Ramadan by joining a host of religious leaders in an interfaith event titled “Ramadan at Home,” organised by the Naz Legacy.",fake

Lime, the largest e-scooter-sharing company in the world, said it would be suspending service in nearly two dozen countries. Bird said it would halt operations in six US cities as well as all of its European markets. And Spin, which is owned by Ford, has had to pause service in “very few” cities and universities.

The decisions to suspend service reflect the rapidly changing environment in the US and around the world in response to COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Just three days ago, Lime was the only scooter company to halt operations in two US states and three European countries.

Lime, with roughly 120,000 scooters in 30 countries, is making the most drastic cuts

Now, with “shelter-in-place” orders, social distancing, and most people simply staying at home, scooter companies are likely seeing a steep drop in demand. The timing of the pandemic is also posing a challenge for the money-losing scooter business, that sees its business slow down in the winter and pick back up again when the weather turns warm.

Lime, with roughly 120,000 scooters in 30 countries, is making the most drastic cuts. The company said it was “winding down or pausing” service in the following countries: Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Chile, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK, and the US.

The company’s scooters remain available in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates; Brisbane, Australia; Busan, South Korea; Christchurch, New Zealand; Dunedin, New Zealand; Hamilton, New Zealand; Selwyn District, New Zealand; Seoul, South Korea; and Sydney, Australia.

Bird said it is pausing service in San Francisco, San Jose, Sacramento, Portland, Miami, and Coral Gables. The company has also pulled its scooters from all of its European markets, which includes Annecy, Antwerp, Barcelona, Berlin, Bordeaux, Cologne, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Krakow, Lisbon, Lyon, Madrid, Marseille, Munich, Paris, Rimini, Sevilla, Stockholm, Torino, Verona, and Vienna.

“The COVID-19 pandemic is undeniably affecting countless lives on a global scale.”

“The COVID-19 pandemic is undeniably affecting countless lives on a global scale. Given our deep understanding of and empathy towards the cities, communities and people we serve, we are temporarily pausing our service in a variety of cities,” a spokesperson said. “This is very fluid as the response to COVID-19 evolves and is in line with voluntary, as well as mandatory measures set by local governments for businesses.”

In contrast, Spin says it has been asked to “step up” by some cities to help “fill transportation gaps after the public bus system was shut down.” The Ford-owned company says it was designated as an “essential service” during the city’s shelter-in-place order “and encouraged to continue operations as a healthy mobility option.” Still, Spin said it has also paused operations “in very few markets,” either because a city requested it or because a university campus has been shut down. (A spokesperson didn’t specify which cities it had paused service.)

For the remaining scooters still available to rent, all of the companies say they have stepped up their sanitizing efforts and instituted new workplace protocols for employees to ensure social distancing in the warehouses that are still opened.

Lyft is still offering scooters to rent in San Francisco, but it halted operations in Miami at the request of the city. Jump, which is owned by Uber, didn’t respond to requests for comment. According to Streetsblog, Jump has only paused scooter operations in Sacramento, California. Last month, Lyft said in a regulatory filing that the outbreak in China has led to production delays of certain automotive parts and components of bikes and scooters.

Scooter-sharing isn’t the only mobility service to suffer due to the pandemic

Scooter-sharing isn’t the only mobility service to suffer due to the pandemic. Public transportation ridership has cratered and fare revenue has practically dried up. Ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft are also seeing precipitous drops in gross bookings in cities hit hard by the disease. Three weeks of social distancing and warnings to stay at home have taken a huge bite out of the total number of trips taken with all modes of transportation.

But as people avoid transit and shared modes of travel, the silver lining seems to be the number of personal mobility trips that are rising. In New York City, for instance, cycling traffic on the East River bridges is up over 50 percent and Citi Bike ridership is up almost 70 percent compared to this time last year. But city officials aren’t doing enough to protect those riders who are switching to bikes; cyclist injuries were up 43 percent between March 9th and March 15th, according to NYPD statistics obtained by Streetsblog.

Cities have a unique opportunity during the pandemic to remake their streets to better prioritize these low-carbon forms of transportation. “While staying at home and following government recommendations for social distancing is the first order of priorities, if you have to take a trip and do not want to ride public transport, or if public transport has reduced service, the bicycle can be a good alternative,” Virginia Tech transportation expert Ralph Buehler said in an email.",real
1494,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/05/19/moscow-coronavirus-vladimir-putin-265227,2020-05-19,How Russia’s Coronavirus Crisis Got So Bad,"Despite the official assurances, by mid-March our only topic was coronavirus. Should we be worried or not? Some were cavalier. “It’s a bunch of nonsense,” said Masha, the owner of a big friendly mutt. Others were worried, especially if they had health problems or, like one neighbor, a newborn grandchild at home. And we were all worried about the dozen or so small businesses that had appeared on our block in the past couple years — especially because some of the owners were our neighbors.

Alexander, the owner of a big white boxer, has a nail salon in the building next to us. He was worried. The ruble had already tumbled against the dollar and euro. To be on the safe side, he had borrowed some money from a friend and bought a large stockpile of imported materials. And then he waited. But not for long. Just about a week later, Sobyanin, the Moscow mayor, ordered all nonessential stores and services to close, including Alexander’s nail salon.

In other countries, salons might have closed immediately. But Alexander was worried about his staff. He called them in to discuss their options, and they decided to take the opposite approach, to keep the salon open late every night until the cutoff date, March 28, so that they could earn enough money to hold them over for a week or so. That was almost two months ago. The salon has been closed since.

Alexander and his wife have other jobs that provide basic income. He thinks some of his staff are earning money doing house calls, and others are just waiting it out. Even when he can reopen, he doesn’t really know how to reopen. “It’s a question of safety for the staff and customers. I can figure out how to keep two meters between customers, but when will people feel safe and confident enough to come in?” He thinks it may be a year or more before he can recoup losses and pay off the debt in rent he is running up.

Another neighbor and dog owner Sergei runs a specialty shop. He used to get 35 to 50 orders a day; now it’s two or three. “My landlord lowered the rent by 40 percent, but that doesn’t help much when income has fallen by 90 percent,” he told me.

I asked Nikolai Petrov, a senior research fellow on the Russia and Eurasia Program at Chatham House in London and professor in the political science department at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow, why he thought Putin was willing to risk alienating voters like Alexander and Sergei.

Petrov said Putin didn’t need their support. “Authoritarian regimes rely on important people who are key to stability and staying in power,” he said. “Putin’s political base is the big companies, banks and state companies. He doesn’t depend on citizens, so he doesn’t see or hear those 10 or 15 or 20 percent of the population who are really suffering today from the measures to fight Covid.”

On May 11, Putin announced that the “national vacation” that had begun in March would end the next day, but that each regional leader would determine how and when to open up businesses. In Moscow, Sobyanin announced that the lockdown would continue until at least the end of the month and now include mandatory gloves and masks in public places, but that several categories of business could open. People shook their heads: Is the situation more dangerous or safer?

And there was a new joke making the rounds: “When we had 1,000 new infections every day, we were put on lockdown. Now that we have over 10,000 new infections every day, they’re sending us back to work.”

The problem is that not everyone is going back to work or working at home on salary. Small shops, businesses and services are still closed. In our neighborhood, one beauty salon — a branch of a citywide chain — closed and moved out within the first week of the lockdown. Three other shops have closed and might not reopen.

With the economic pressure mounting, Putin announced in his May address that he would increase aid to the population, mostly through direct payments to families with children, but including tax and insurance write-offs for sole proprietors and even reimbursement of income taxes paid in 2019. I asked my friends if this would help; they laughed. The first round of aid consisted mostly of benefits such as partial debt forgiveness, salary reimbursements if companies continued to pay their staff, and some tax deferments — none of which they qualified for or needed — and the current aid package wasn’t enough to make up for their catastrophic loss of income and continued rent payments.

But neither Alexander nor Sergei had expected state aid. “We never thought we’d get any support,” Sergei said. “But that’s the deal. Either you’re free and are totally on your own, or you work for the state and get a salary and aid, but you also have to do what they say, go to political rallies, whatever. Better to be free.”

Looking ahead, it’s clear that millions of small-business people, gig economy workers, waiters, salespeople, actors, dancers, musicians, museum curators, nannies, cleaners, fitness instructors and all those Russians working off the books — a large portion of the population — could come out of this with nothing. If they hold on to their businesses, they will probably have a huge debt to pay off. Many thousands, if not millions, of them could lose everything.

To some extent, given the nature of the crisis, economic pain is inevitable. Sonin says, “The crisis is unprecedented, and because the government didn’t move quickly and the measures aren’t, to my mind, sufficient, the downturn will be greater. But getting out of this crisis would have been difficult regardless of what Russia did.”

The government’s approach isn’t going to improve its popularity ratings, Sonin says, but adds, “I don’t think there is a risk of great discontent. In 2008 and 2009, the GDP fell by 9 percent, and the majority of households were cutting back on basic necessities. But the public didn’t rebel then, and I think it will be about the same this time.”

Nor does he think this crisis, however difficult, will spur Russian leadership to change: “There is no discussion of reconsidering priorities, like cutting back on defense spending, security, or propaganda, or repealing the countersanctions, which in my view would have been the first thing to do. There is no discussion of any of that. That’s not being done because they think the way things are is the way the things ought to be.”",real
1732,https://www.infowars.com/poll-a-quarter-of-americans-are-not-interested-in-coronavirus-vaccine/,2020-05-22,Poll: A Quarter Of Americans Are Not Interested In Coronavirus Vaccine,"A Reuters/Ipsos poll published Thursday has revealed that a quarter of Americans are not interested in taking a coronavirus vaccine.

The poll founds that 14% were not interested at all, and 10% were not very interested in the vaccine.

However, while that 24% dismissed the idea, two thirds, 66%, said they are either “very” or “somewhat” interested in taking a vaccine when it is produced.

Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, said “It’s a little lower than I thought it would be with all the attention to COVID-19,” adding “I would have expected somewhere around 75 percent.”

The Reuters report notes that health experts believe “at least 70% of Americans would need to be immune through a vaccine or prior infection to achieve what is known as “herd immunity,” when enough people are resistant to an infectious disease to prevent its spread.”

Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine noted that “It’s not surprising a significant percentage of Americans are not going to take the vaccine because of the terrible messaging we’ve had, the absence of a communication plan around the vaccine and this very aggressive anti-vaccine movement.”

The poll also found that 36% of respondents would be less willing to take a vaccine if President Trump said it was safe, with just 14% said they would be interested.

A week ago, Trump announced “Operation Warp Speed,” to fast-track the development and distribution of a coronavirus vaccine by January 2021, tapping experts and resources in science, medicine, the military, and the private sector.

Trump has said that the military will be deployed to distribute the vaccine, but has suggested that it will remain voluntary, noting that it will be for those “who want to get it,” and “Not everyone is going to want to get it.”

The investigation determined that only one person at the practice had ""cold-like symptoms"" beginning a few days prior to the practice. That individual was later confirmed to have COVID-19, Skagit County Public Health said.

The choir practice is not the only super-spreading event that has happened during the coronavirus pandemic, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the potential for these events ""underscores the importance"" of social distancing and avoiding large gatherings.

Here's a breakdown of what these events are and how they happen.

What is a super-spreading event?

Super-spreading events ""occur when a single person infects a large number of other people — sometimes 10, 20, sometimes even more in one setting,"" said Dr. Justin Lessler, an associate professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.



Other examples of super-spreading events during the coronavirus pandemic include 15 cases stemming from one person at multiple family gatherings in Chicago and more than 100 cases tracing back to multiple South Korean nightclubs that were visited by a man who later tested positive for the virus.



The term ""super-spreader"" refers to a person who spreads a disease to a large number of people.

""It's kind of different for different diseases whether it's a person or an event, but for COVID, it would be more like an event,"" said Dr. Jaline Gerardin, an assistant professor of preventive medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.



The ""world's most famous super-spreader"" was Mary Mallon, known as ""Typhoid Mary,"" Lessler said. She infected many people with typhoid fever over several years in the early 1900s.

How do super-spreading events happen?

These events happen because of ""a combination of biology and setting,"" Lessler said.

An infected person has to be at a point in their illness when they are very transmissible and they have to be in a place where they can infect a lot of other people.

Places where people are densely packed and engaging in something that involves a lot of breathing, like singing or talking, are particularly risky for super spreading, Gerardin said.

Could the infected person be asymptomatic?

Yes, the person could be asymptomatic or presymptomatic, the doctors said.

""They may not feel sick, but the infection has spread enough in their body that they're shedding virus and they're putting enough virus out there to infect other people,"" Lessler said.

What is the average infection rate for the coronavirus?

Doctors have said they believe the number of people that one person with coronavirus typically infects is two to three. That number, however, is considered ""over-dispersed,"" Lessler said.

""When we say over-dispersed, what we mean is there are super-spreading events, so the average might be two, let's say, but most people are infecting one or no people and then a very few people are infecting 8 to 10 or even more people,"" he said.

The number of typical infections also varies by the density of an area and whether or not people are staying home.

How do we prevent super-spreading events?

The social distancing guidelines many places have adopted help reduce super-spreading events, the doctors said.

""We can either prevent them entirely by limiting the size of gatherings or we can mitigate a lot of the risk through good prevention,"" such as having everyone wear masks and being somewhere that's well ventilated, Gerardin said.",real

Soon after, ""Flintstone Vitamins"" began trending on Twitter.

But, many doctors, journalists and politicians issued stern warnings after the president's revelation.

Trump, who said he has tested negative for COVID-19, said he has been taking hydroxychloroquine daily for about a week and a half as an added measure to avoid getting the coronavirus. He said the White House physician ""didn't recommend"" hydroxychloroquine but offered it to him.

He has repeatedly touted the drug as a treatment for coronavirus, despite little concrete evidence it effectively treats the disease. There is no data to support the notion that hydroxychloroquine helps people infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.

More:Can hydroxychloroquine prevent COVID-19? President Trump thinks maybe. There's no data to support that.

Fox News anchor Neil Cavuto warned of taking hydroxychloroquine, saying it could kill people who are in certain health risk populations.

""The fact of the matter is though, when the president said 'what have you got to lose?', in a number of studies, those certain vulnerable population has one thing to lose: their lives,"" Cavuto said.

He continued, ""I cannot stress enough. This will kill you. So, again, whatever benefits the president says this has, and certainly it has had for those suffering from malaria, dealing with lupus, this is a leap that should not be taking casually by those watching from home or assuming well the president of the United States says it's ok.""

A few studies have shown the drug has not been effective against COVID-19, and some point to an increase in heart problems.

Sen. Warren on brother's COVID-19 death: 'It just feels like something that didn't have to happen'

The FDA has cautioned that hydroxychloroquine should be limited to people in clinical trials, which are carefully overseen, or who are hospitalized, due to concerns about the potentially dangerous adverse effects. Trump appears to be taking it as a prophylactic, with the thought it could prevent someone exposed to coronavirus from getting it.

""Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have not been shown to be safe and effective for treating or preventing COVID-19,"" the FDA warned. Both can cause abnormal heart rhythms and a dangerously rapid heart rate, the statement said.

Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and former health commissioner for Baltimore, tweeted that ""There is NO evidence for hydrochloroquine being effective in treatment of #covid19 or prophylaxis to prevent the disease.""

""This is a medication that has serious side effects. I am very concerned about @realDonaldTrump continuing to model behavior that could harm many Americans,"" she concluded.

Senator Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, tweeted, ""I took hydroxychloroquine too. For malaria, 28 years ago. Because I am not a lunatic.""

Congressman Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, who briefly ran to be the 2020 Democratic nominee, warned followers to not self-medicate with the drug, and posted that, ""The FDA has repeatedly warned against taking hydroxychloroquine. It has potentially deadly side effects.""

Trump's top health advisers – Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx – showed up at a White House event last Friday with protective masks, though the president himself continued to avoid using any facial protection in public.

Trump also claimed that cutting off relations with China would save the United States some $500 billion.

Dr Paul Craig Roberts, an American economist who served as the United States assistant secretary of the treasury for economic policy, has shared his views on the matter.

Sputnik: In a recent interview, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell stressed that the percentage of GDP shrinkage in the second quarter is ""going to be very high"", even as much as 20 percent. How can the US sustain its economy during the crisis?

Dr Paul Craig Roberts: All economies that had closedowns are experiencing shrinkages, even Sweden, a country that did not impose a mandatory closedown to the same extent. The Swedish people on their own closed the economy in an effort to protect themselves from infection. America’s economic problem is deeper and more long term than COVID-19.

American corporations offshored many manufacturing and professional skill jobs. These are high value-added, high productivity jobs that produced middle class incomes. These jobs were the ladders of upward mobility. When the jobs were sent abroad, the middle class underwent shrinkage and so did consumer disposable income or purchasing power, which lowered economic growth.

The movement abroad of jobs also reduced the state, local, and federal tax base. There was shrinkage in funding for state and local social services and infrastructure. Debt grew. To sustain aggregate demand, the Federal Reserve used an increase in consumer debt as a substitute for the missing growth in consumer income. This policy could work only until consumers were too indebted — mortgage, car, credit card, student loans — to be able to take on any more debt. Debt service used up consumer incomes, leaving little discretionary spending to drive the economy and leading to the current situation of ""debt deflation"".

Debt deflation is a situation of falling income and employment because debt service uses up the income left after meeting basic needs of food and housing. To correct this problem requires US corporations to bring the offshored jobs back home. That is, the solution requires the end of globalism.

Sputnik: The only economy that is now starting to recover is the Chinese economy. How great are the chances that China could overtake the US as the global economic leader? What would the reaction by the US administration be to this?

Dr Paul Craig Roberts: In terms of purchasing power parity, the Chinese economy is larger than the US economy. Unless China adopts the American practice of offshoring its manufacturing and professional skill jobs, China will continue to move further ahead of the US.

Sputnik: In the event we see further growth in the Chinese economy, shaking up American hegemony, how likely is it that we’ll see further pushback from the US towards China, such as going back to a trade war, imposing tariffs for example, or trying to pin the blame for the coronavirus on Beijing?

Dr Paul Craig Roberts: The so-called ""trade war"" and tariffs imposed on imports from China are a misconception of the problem. The White House mistakenly sees the US trade deficit with China as the result of unfair Chinese trading practices. What the White House does not understand is that the ""Chinese imports"" are the products of US corporations, such as Apple, Nike, and Levi, that are produced abroad for sale in the US. When the US corporations bring their products to the US, they count as imports. So the fact is that it is the global US corporations, not China, that are responsible for the trade deficit. Instead of blaming China and worsening US-China relations, President Trump should be blaming US corporations.

Sputnik: There’s been an ongoing argument that the Chinese political and economic model is the key to “success” in containing the flow and aftermath of COVID-19. To what extent would you agree with this? Has the Chinese model indeed proven its viability, despite being sharply criticised around the world?

Dr Paul Craig Roberts: Economists and politicians do not understand what the ""Chinese Model"" is. It is more than a mixed economy of government and private companies developing according to a strategic plan. The most important part of the Chinese Model is the manufacturing capability, technology, and business know-how given to the Chinese by the US corporations that moved their production to China. A large part of the US economy was simply ripped out of the US and sent to China. This is the reason that China progressed so much more rapidly than anyone thought possible.

Sputnik: In your opinion, which countries have been able to contain the outbreak, both saving the lives of their citizens and protecting their economies? How might the global rating of economies be reshuffled in light of this?

The COVID-19 infection and mortality statistics are not very good, which makes comparisons unreliable. Generally, testing is not widespread and the tests are not always accurate. Moreover, deaths are counted differently. What does seem to be clear is that Asian countries, such as China and South Korea, did a better job of responding to the virus and controlling its spread.

The US and Europe were slow to respond and were unprepared despite knowing what was happening in China. Possibly also, the Chinese and Korean populations are more homogeneous and more cooperative with government than the disparate, multicultural populations that massive immigration has created in North America and Western Europe. These countries are essentially Towers of Babel, which impedes cooperation.

0,https://www.nytimes.com/article/what-is-coronavirus.html,2020-01-21,The Coronavirus: What Scientists Have Learned So Far,"
A novel respiratory virus that originated in Wuhan, China, last December has spread to six continents. Hundreds of thousands have been infected, at least 20,000 people have died and the spread of the coronavirus was called a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March.
Much remains unknown about the virus, including how many people may have very mild or asymptomatic infections, and whether they can transmit the virus. The precise dimensions of the outbreak are hard to know.
Here’s what scientists have learned so far about the virus and the outbreak.What is a coronavirus?
Coronaviruses are named for the spikes that protrude from their surfaces, resembling a crown or the sun’s corona. They can infect both animals and people, and can cause illnesses of the respiratory tract.
At least four types of coronaviruses cause very mild infections every year, like the common cold. Most people get infected with one or more of these viruses at some point in their lives.
Another coronavirus that circulated in China in 2003 caused a more dangerous condition known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS. The virus was contained after it had sickened 8,098 people and killed 774.
Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012, is also caused by a coronavirus.
The new virus has been named SARS-CoV-2. The disease it causes is called Covid-19. How dangerous is it?It is hard to accurately assess the lethality of a new virus. It appears to be less often fatal than the coronaviruses that caused SARS or MERS, but significantly more so than the seasonal flu. The fatality rate was over 2 percent, in one study. But government scientists have estimated that the real figure could be below 1 percent, roughly the rate occurring in a severe flu season.
About 5 percent of the patients who were hospitalized in China had critical illnesses. Children seem less likely to be infected with the new coronavirus, while middle-aged and older adults are disproportionately infected.
Men are more likely to die from an infection compared to women, possibly because they produce weaker immune responses and have higher rates of tobacco consumption, Type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure than women, which may increase the risk of complications following an infection.
“This is a pattern we’ve seen with many viral infections of the respiratory tract — men can have worse outcomes,” said Sabra Klein, a scientist who studies sex differences in viral infections and vaccination responses at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
How is the new coronavirus transmitted?Experts believe that an infected animal may have first transmitted the virus to humans at a market that sold live fish, animals and birds in Wuhan. The market was later shut down and disinfected, making it nearly impossible to investigate which animal may have been the exact origin.
Bats are considered a possible source, because they have evolved to coexist with many viruses, and they were found to be the starting point for SARS. It is also possible that bats transmitted the virus to an intermediate animal, such as pangolins, which are consumed as a delicacy in parts of China, and may have then passed on the virus to humans.
The outbreak grew because of human-to-human transmission.
People infected with the virus produce tiny respiratory droplets when they breathe, talk, cough or sneeze, allowing the virus to travel through the air.
Most respiratory droplets fall to the ground within a few feet. People who are in close contact with those infected, particularly family members and health care workers, may catch the virus this way.
Scientists don’t know how long the new coronavirus can live on surfaces, and preliminary research suggests that hot and humid environments may not slow down the pathogen’s spread. Warm weather does tend to inhibit influenza and milder coronaviruses.
Infected people may be able to pass on the new coronavirus even if they have few obvious symptoms, a study in Germany has found. That’s “bad news,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an expert in infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville.
When people don’t know they are infected, “they’re up and about, going to work or the gym or to religious services, and breathing on or near other people,” he said. Still, a report by the World Health Organization suggests that asymptomatic cases are rare.

What symptoms should I look out for?Symptoms of this infection include fever, cough and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. The illness causes lung lesions and pneumonia. But milder cases may resemble the flu or a bad cold, making detection difficult.
Patients may exhibit other symptoms, too, such as gastrointestinal problems or diarrhea. Current estimates suggest that symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as long as 14 days after being exposed to the virus.
If you have a fever or a cough and recently visited China, South Korea, Italy or another place with a known coronavirus outbreak, or spent time with someone who did, see your health care provider. Call first, so the office can prepare for your visit and take steps to protect other patients and staff from potential exposure.
Is there a test for the virus? What is the treatment? There is a diagnostic test that can determine if you are infected. It was developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, based on genetic information about the virus provided by the Chinese authorities.
In early February, the C.D.C. sent diagnostic test kits to 200 state laboratories, but some of the kits were flawed and recalled. Now other laboratories are making their own tests. Other countries are using test kits manufactured locally or sent out by the W.H.O.
The C.D.C. announced that anyone who wanted to be tested could, if a doctor approves the request. Private companies, such as LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics, are also rushing to provide tests at various labs across the country, but the supply has yet to meet public demand. Many patients complain that they still cannot get tested.

Once a coronavirus infection is confirmed, the treatment is mainly supportive,  making sure the patient is getting enough oxygen, managing his or her fever and using a ventilator to push air into the lungs if necessary, said Dr. Julie Vaishampayan, chairwoman of the public health committee at the Infectious Diseases Society of America.
Patients with mild cases are told to rest and drink plenty of fluids “while the immune system does its job and heals itself,” she said. Most people with mild infections recover in about two weeks. More than half of those who have been infected globally have already  recovered.
A number of drugs are currently being tested as potential treatments, including  an antiviral medication called remdesivir, which appears to be effective in animals and was used to treat the first American patient in Washington State. The National Institutes of Health is testing the drug on infected patient in a clinical trial in Nebraska. The drug’s maker, Gilead, has also begun trials at various sites in Asia.
How long will it take to develop a vaccine?A coronavirus vaccine is still months away — and perhaps years. While new technology, advancements in genomics and improved global coordination have allowed researchers to act quickly, vaccine development remains an expensive and risky process.
After the SARS outbreak in 2003, it took researchers about 20 months to get a vaccine ready for human trials. (The vaccine was never needed, because the disease was eventually contained.)
By the time of the Zika outbreak in 2015, researchers had brought the vaccine development timeline down to six months.
Now, they hope that work from past outbreaks will help cut the timeline further. Scientists at the National Institutes of Health and several companies are working on vaccine candidates.
Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said a preliminary clinical trial might get off the ground in as little as three months. But researchers would still need to conduct extensive testing to prove a vaccine was safe and effective.
How can I protect myself?The best thing you can do to avoid getting infected is to follow the same general guidelines that experts recommend during flu season, because the coronavirus spreads in much the same way. Wash your hands frequently throughout the day. Avoid touching your face, and maintain a distance — at least six feet — from anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
The risk of infection with the new coronavirus in the United States “is way too low for the general public to start wearing a face mask,” said Dr. Peter Rabinowitz, co-director of the University of Washington MetaCenter for Pandemic Preparedness and Global Health Security.
But, he added, “if you have symptoms of a respiratory illness, wearing a mask reduces the risk of infecting others.”
Should I cancel my international travel plans?Many countries have also enacted travel restrictions and bans, closing their doors to people from countries with sustained transmission of the virus. Governments around the world have been screening incoming passengers for signs of illness.
Is it too late to contain the virus? W.H.O. officials have credited lockdown measures China imposed in late January for averting the spread of more cases from Wuhan. China sealed off cities, shut down businesses and schools, and ordered residents to remain in their homes. Officials use cellphone data to track and intercept those who have been to Hubei Province.
In recent weeks, government workers have gone door-to-door to round up people who are infected, placing them in stadiums and other buildings that have been converted to makeshift hospitals. Now, official reports suggest that new cases in China are waning.
But there is growing fear that containment may no longer be possible. Clarence Tam, an assistant professor of infectious diseases at the School of Public Health at the National University of Singapore, said the surge of cases in multiple countries was “concerning because we know the transmissions are spreading at a fast rate.”
“We’ve learned some things of this new virus for the past couple of weeks that make it seem unlikely that containment will be a strategy that will completely stop this virus,” he added.
There is benefit to delaying its spread as long as possible. Containing the virus may buy health officials more time to stock hospitals with test kits and respirators, and for local governments, companies and schools to enact strategies — telecommuting and online classes, for instance — that may reduce the spread.
But the ability of nations to prepare for the arrival of coronavirus cases will depend largely on the strength of their health systems, capacity to conduct tests and effectiveness in communicating updates to the public.
“We have been dealing with flu for decades, and even now it seems some countries don’t even have a policy for influenza preparedness,” said Leo Poon, head of the University of Hong Kong’s public health laboratory sciences division. “Not to mention something which is new to them. That’s a problem.”

The U.S. Treasury Department offered amnesty to public companies that return money they borrowed by May 18, saying it would deem they made the application in good faith due to economic uncertainty fueled by the coronavirus outbreak, before guidelines were clarified.

The country’s energy sector has been clamoring for government aid in the wake of plummeting oil prices that have driven several debt-laden exploration and production companies into bankruptcy.

While President Donald Trump said last month his administration would formulate a plan to help the oil and gas industry, no specific aid has been announced. This has left energy companies to seek relief under the broader $2.3 trillion U.S. stimulus package.

One aspect of the latter that has been used by oil and gas firms is the so-called Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) for small businesses, providing loans that can be forgiven to cover payroll expenses, as well as mortgage interest, rent and utility costs.

Denver-based exploration and production company PDC Energy Inc (PDCE.O), which has a market capitalization of $1.3 billion, said on May 8 it had returned its $10 million PPP loan.

Natural Gas Services Group (NGS.N) also returned its $4.6 million PPP loan. Its chief executive, Stephen Taylor, said the Midland, Texas-based compression equipment provider had to cut 20% of its workforce after it returned the funds.

Public companies and their employees were being “discriminated against” by a “politically driven process”, Taylor told analysts during the company’s first-quarter earnings call on May 7.

Dawson Geophysical Co (DWSN.O) returned its $6.4 million PPP loan last week, the company said in a May 14 filing. Midland-based Dawson, which produces seismic data for oil and gas firms, cited “an abundance of caution” and new guidance for the decision.

Among those receiving loans, but which had not disclosed whether they would return the funds as of Monday, included Calumet Specialty Products (CLMT.O). The Indianapolis-based refiner received $31.4 million through five PPP applications.

Exploration firms Amplify Energy Corp (AMPY.N) and Battalion Oil Corp BATL.A received $5.5 million and $2.2 million respectively. Houston-based onshore driller Independence Contract Drilling (ICD.N) gained a $10 million PPP loan.

The quartet, along with the other five listed oil and gas firms that received PPP loans, did not respond to requests for comment.

Energy companies have also benefited from emergency tax reform enacted in the wake of the pandemic.

More than $2 billion of benefits were recorded by a combined 43 companies due to two changes in the tax code, including one allowing current losses to be offset against past income tax bills, a Reuters review of first-quarter earnings statements found.",real

According to The Independent, the so-called ""Big Six"" English Premier League clubs, namely Manchester United, Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea, Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur, are opposed to new broadcast plans that aim to give fans a closer look behind the scenes.

The Premier League’s powers have proposed conducting interviews at half-time, and filming team talks in a bid to drum up interest and to compensate for the lack of fan-generated atmosphere, should the division resume play behind closed doors in June.

The Big Six claim that this would add nothing to the ""viewing experience"" enjoyed by spectators, whilst undercutting their own private media channels, which are valuable sources of revenue in the absence of gate receipts.

Teams in England’s top flight have returned to training in the past few days, despite not yet reaching a consensus on issues such as whether to play the remaining matches of the 2019-20 season at neutral venues.

A vote on the matter was supposed to take place last week but was postponed as fears arose that the proposal could be rejected.

Numerous players, including Watford striker Troy Deeney, Tottenham Hotspur left-back Danny Rose, and former England right-back Glen Johnson, have also voiced criticism of plans for players to resume group training, arguing that not enough thought has been given to the player’s health and safety, on and off the pitch.

If the suggestion is ruled out, then it would be doubtful whether Premier League games could actually take place, as only a few options for concluding the campaign would remain viable.

These include rendering the season ""null and void"", calculating the final positions based on mathematical algorithms, or simply ending the league with the current standings in place.

All of these scenarios could prove problematic to clubs in both the upper and lower echelons of the Premier League, and legal challenges are likely to be mounted if teams are either denied honours or forcibly demoted.

The Netherlands, France, Belgium and now Scotland have already decided to end their campaigns prematurely, whilst England, Spain, Italy and Germany are pressing ahead with plans to resume play behind closed doors.

The German Bundesliga is thus far the only league in Europe that has managed to restart, and only time will tell if the attempts made by England, Spain and Italy will prove successful.",fake

If you are a frequent Sons of Liberty Media connoisseur of the website, including the 6 AM Eastern and 3 PM Eastern radio shows, you have heard and read the stance on work – all work is essential; work honors God as He commands us to work; and, government has no authority to determine whether you can work or not.

However, some State governors, like Gretchen “Hitler” Whitmer, have usurped their authority by assuming the power to determine which businesses can open and which cannot, meaning it’s strictly subjective. How else can one explain why a homosexual, sodomite “swinger’s” club can remain open while “Hitler” Whitmer rabidly targets a 77-year-old barber? Yes, you read that correctly. An individual who cuts hair and follows strict cleaning protocols for the coronavirus hoax has lost his license, preventing him from earning a living, while the local homosexual, sodomite swinger’s club, Club Tabu remains open.

Megan Fox, writing for PJ Media, has the story.

There is perhaps nothing more confusing than Democrat governors’ orders during the Chinese WuFlu pandemic. Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer is by far the worst. That was made clear with the news that a gay swinger’s club with “glory holes” is being allowed to operate under her nose in Lansing while she aims her business-killing death ray on 77-year-old barber Karl Manke for giving haircuts.

Gay swinger’s club is essential.

But strangers servicing each other through holes in a basement wall in the state capitol is perfectly fine. I guess group sex is an “essential” activity in the Democrat-run state of Michigan. The underground private club, Club Tabu, has a website that describes what goes on there. (HT: Steve Gruber)

This homosexual sodomite swinger’s club describes events as “private party” lifestyle socials and prohibits sexual activity except in private accommodations. Well, that’s certainly better – NOT, Here’s the big question – If a barber shop cannot open because of violating social distancing “orders” despite the wearing of masks and rigorous cleaning protocols, how does a homosexual sodomite swinger’s club that engages in sexual activity not in violation of those same tyrannical decrees?

Unlike Manke, who is sterilizing everything in his barbershop and wearing a mask to cut hair, Club Tabu has no announcement on their social media about what precautions they are taking, if any, to keep people who are engaging in full body contact with strangers safe. In fact, the only messaging they are giving is that they are open. The website FAQ’s says, “Yes, we are still open; if this website is still up – we are open!!!”

No way was this writer going to “google” anything regarding the holes the basement walls because no need was seen in spreading the debauchery. And, the club does not even announce any precautions on the website – a site unpleasant to visit but necessary to check sources. Here’s the real kicker. Someone posted in the comment section the club should reconsider their precaution and open stance because of the close proximity of people. The club responded, “Data proves different. Additionally, we are a private club and if our members want to visit we will welcome them”.

To be fair, Fox, through PJ Media, attempted to contact the club to verify it being open since a review placed a “patron” there on May 14th. However, there was no answer, but the conclusion drawn, based on the information on the website, indicates the club is in full operation and open.

Fox deduced this is not about health, which is something the alternative media has been saying almost since day one. Where Michigan Governor Gretchen “Hitler” Whitmer is concerned, it is about ego, control, and revenge. This is a woman who sent six officers to serve Karl Manke orders to close his business for violating her “decrees” but can’t bring herself to send officers to Club Tabu to close that business for violating Queen Whitmer’s decree. Oh wait, homosexual sodomite swinging is essential while barber/beauty shops are not.

Fox continues saying:

Our leaders have been giving us incredibly bad advice since this coronavirus pandemic happened including Dr. Fauci himself who insists we all stay in our houses and not see our parents or family members for their own safety while he and the state of New York have given very weird advice about sex and COVID-19. We were told we can’t have lunch with Grandma, but we can have sex with strangers. Seems legit. The New York Post reported:

Toward the end of the taped segment, Fauci was asked: “If you’re swiping on a dating app like Tinder, or Bumble or Grindr, and you match with someone that you think is hot, and you’re just kind of like, ‘Maybe it’s fine if this one stranger comes over.’ What do you say to that person?”

“You know, that’s tough,” replied the befuddled National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director to the curveball. “Because that’s what’s called relative risk.”

Then he dropped the bombshell. “If you’re willing to take a risk — and you know, everybody has their own tolerance for risks — you could figure out if you want to meet somebody,” said Fauci, who was named a candidate for People magazine’s “Sexiest Man Alive” award.

He added, “If you want to go a little bit more intimate, well, then that’s your choice regarding a risk.”

The state of New York put out an equally bizarre guide to sex during the pandemic, which didn’t seem to adhere to social distancing guidelines. Read at your own risk. “You should avoid close contact — including sex — with anyone outside your household. If you do have sex with others, have as few partners as possible.”

The more investigation done into this coronavirus “non”pandemic hoax, the more we see none of these actions are about health, despite the government parading out a doctor who hasn’t seen a patient in 30 years and is a government shill and another doctor who doesn’t even hold an active license in any US State telling us otherwise. This is about control – who will follow like the cowardly sheep they are and who will stand up for freedom, liberty, and God-given individual unalienable rights. Moreover, the government learns who is also apathetic, caring not which way the wind blows.

And, while much of the population is nestled, all snug in their forced “house arrest” and others run around wearing masks, over using hand sanitizer, government at all levels are busy little bees, while both Chambers of Congress not being altogether as the Constitution requires for passing of legislation, presenting pre-written bills by lobbyist that are passed without anyone reading them and sent off to the President’s desk where he is sure to sign them all.

Pastor are being arrested along with salon shop owners despite following the null and void “rules” except the one to keep church and governor-designated businesses closed. Church congregation members have been ticketed for attending services and law enforcement have even taken license plate numbers in order to citation the car owners. Church and hair establishments are verboten, but businesses catering to homosexual sodomite swinging orgies are open without restrictions.

Not to be taking sides here, but Club Tabu did get it right when indicating the data does not support the level of measures governors and the feds have “decreed” upon the people. Being a “private club” has nothing to do with whether you follow unconstitutional decrees or not. Neither does any other business the public enters. How could it when one is dealing with a hoax? This coronavirus hoax is being used as the catalyst to rapidly implement an agenda created by opportunistic globalists to crush the united States in every way possible.

For this agenda, Whitmer is the poster female governor idiot. If one wonders what fascist communism looks like as far as the social aspect, look no further than Gretchen Whitmer. If people do not get enraged by the fact that homosexual sodomite swinger club “Tabu” is open for business while law enforcement, under orders, descended upon a 77-year-old barber to shut his business doors, there is little hope for a return to a pre-hoax normal.

603,https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/5/21248095/coronavirus-case-deaths-national-data-black-african-american-counties,2020-05-05,A majority of coronavirus deaths in the US were in disproportionately black counties,"Half of all COVID-19 cases and nearly 60 percent of deaths due to the disease in the US occurred in counties that are disproportionately black, according to newly released data that is still being reviewed by scientists. The numbers of COVID-19 diagnoses and deaths are also higher in counties with a bigger proportion of black residents, the new analysis shows.

Only 22 percent of counties in the United States are disproportionately black, but the people within them have endured the majority of deaths in the country. These findings are the most comprehensive evidence we have yet showing how the novel coronavirus is taking a heavier toll on African Americans since national demographic data on race has so far been incomplete. An accurate picture of who is hardest hit is needed so that these disparities don’t play out again when it comes to who can get a vaccine and treatments as these become available, researchers say.

“We might see history repeat itself”

“Unfortunately, we might see history repeat itself when a vaccine becomes available,” Gregorio Millett, the study’s lead investigator, said in a press call. “That’s why it’s important to have studies like this and other studies that come out to show where COVID-19 diagnoses and deaths are concentrated to make sure that these marginalized populations are among the first to have access.”

This study was released today on the website of amfAR, the Foundation for AIDS Research to allow other scientists to comment on it. The results may change before it is finalized and published. The foundation worked in collaboration with Emory University, Johns Hopkins, O’Neill Institute, Georgetown University, and the University of Mississippi Medical Center. They analyzed data on the pandemic collected on or before April 13th.

The racial breakdown of COVID-19 cases has trickled out from states and cities since March. More than 80 percent of coronavirus patients hospitalized in Georgia were black, according to a recent sample taken by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of 305 patients. That’s despite black residents making up less than one-third of the population. But the CDC’s national data is still missing the races of more than 55 percent of COVID-19 cases nationwide.

Lawmakers have urged the Department of Health and Human Services to collect racial and ethnic demographics. “Lack of information will exacerbate existing health disparities and result in the loss of lives in vulnerable communities,” they wrote in a March 27th letter to the agency. “Existing racial disparities and inequities in health outcomes and health care access may mean that the nation’s response to preventing and mitigating its harms will not be felt equally in every community.”

“the nation’s response to preventing and mitigating its harms will not be felt equally”

More than 90 percent of the disproportionately black counties studied are in the South. But the researchers found that cases and deaths were higher in African American communities, regardless of whether the area was more rural or more urban.

In New York City, the epicenter of the pandemic, there are stark differences in the rates of hospitalizations and deaths by county, according to a recent study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The Bronx has the highest proportion of racial and ethnic minorities and higher death and hospitalization rates than New York City’s other boroughs, which each have their own counties. Manhattan is predominately white, and it has the lowest rates for deaths and hospitalizations.

The new national study also highlighted that rates of being uninsured, living in crowded households, and being exposed to more air pollution were also higher in counties that were disproportionately black — all factors associated with making it harder for these communities to stay healthy. These counties were also less likely to social distance compared to other counties, based on location data from cellphones. The study also noted that African Americans are more likely to be essential workers who aren’t able to work from home, despite shelter-in-place orders.

While the data is still emerging, it’s not necessarily surprising to public health experts who have worked to end racial disparities in a broad range of health outcomes that are a result of long-standing economic and social barriers. “It’s the social conditions that we have created,” says, David Williams, a professor of public health at Harvard, told The Verge in April. “I hope this is a wake up call for America.”",real

Do they start allowing businesses like restaurants, theaters and hair salons to reopen, as Georgia did despite more than 20,000 cases there so far and opposition from several mayors? Is it OK to reopen beaches and stores, like South Carolina did? Or do they take a more cautious approach, as Massachusetts is doing by keeping schools closed through the end of the school year?

These decisions aren’t simple.

How and when states reopen their economies will look different from one state to the next state depending, in part, on where that state is in the trajectory of its coronavirus illnesses.

Can states start reopening without triggering a new surge?

We expect to see some rise in cases when economic and social activities restart. We don’t want to wait until there is no chance that would happen — people would literally go stir-crazy in their homes and it would decimate the economy.

What we want is to be confident that we have the capacity to identify coronavirus cases quickly and control the spread through contact tracing and isolation when we see them start to emerge again.

Can every state just follow the White House plan?

Under our country’s federalist system, protection of public health and safety is reserved to the state.

The White House’s plan provides a helpful starting point by offering a least restrictive path, but it suggests removing restrictions much more quickly than many public health people feel comfortable with.

For example, one trigger for the first phase of lifting restrictions is a downward trajectory, with 14 days of decreasing numbers of new COVID-19 cases. At that point, the White House plan says there can be large gatherings including at sports events and movie theaters, provided social distancing is followed.

Washington State has probably met that two-week threshold, but don’t expect Washington to allow large gatherings soon. Statistically, the chance of someone asymptomatic and infectious being at one of those gatherings and exposing a large number of people is pretty high. That’s a risk many states aren’t going to take.

Different models, including by researchers at Harvard Chan School of Public Health and Kathryn Peebles at the University of Washington, have suggested that you need to wait longer than 14 days to be confident you wouldn’t get a large resurgence. That could mean three or four weeks — I’m not saying months and months and months. But 14 days seems really short based on what I’ve seen of the coronavirus case curves and where most places are on that trajectory.

What do states gain by coordinating their plans?

Going into the first phase of lifting restrictions, states need to have enough testing and contact tracing capacity to be confident they can manage the cases that will still turn up. Even if a state isn’t seeing cases spreading within communities, travelers are still coming in from places where the pandemic is active.

Right now, we don’t have that capacity, even in Washington, and we have better capacity that most of the country.

That’s one reason partnering with other states makes sense.

When Washington partners with California and Oregon, we can pool our resources for developing testing capacity and contact tracing capacity. That bumps up the timeline for getting enough resources in place that we can be confident we can start lifting restrictions. It should take us much less time if we’re working together, and that’s huge.

Another big advantage is consistent messaging across a region where people cross state lines all the time.

Should all states be coordinating with others?

For states to coordinate, it’s helpful if they’re at similar stages in the epidemic. That’s part of why it makes sense for a few states to coordinate on the same plan rather than having one plan for the entire country.

New York is having such a different experience that it would be difficult for that state to coordinate reopening with Washington or California. In Washington, when the cases numbers plateaued, we were able to send extra ventilators to other regions. New York needs to be taking different steps at different times and has different resource challenges.

In Washington, Oregon and California, we also have similarities in how people and the governors weigh public health risk versus economic risk in a situation like this. Part of the reason Washington has done well after the early outbreak was that our local health departments were good about jumping on contact tracing and preparations, so by the time we did have community-level transmission, they had been preparing for weeks. We also have elected officials who have worked hand in hand with their public health officials.

Is a second surge of cases a foregone conclusion?

It is possible that we won’t see a second peak.

Having a vaccine widely available or a treatment people could take to prevent transmitting the disease could help the country avoid another surge. It’s also possible, as we saw with MERS and SARS, that once we are able to contain everything and get it to a low enough level, the coronavirus could die out on its own.

But we don’t want to count on that and not prepare for the possibility it comes back, particularly since so many people haven’t been infected. We still have a lot of people who are really vulnerable, so if we’re not careful enough about how we bring economic and social activities back online, we could have a resurgence.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ""let the country down"" early in the nation's response to the Covid-19 crisis when it failed to scale diagnostic testing across the country, White House trade advisor Peter Navarro said on Sunday.

""Early on in this crisis the CDC, which really had the most trusted brand around the world in this space, really let the country down with the testing,"" Navarro told NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ""Not only did they keep the testing within the bureaucracy, they had a bad test, and that did set us back.""

When asked whether the White House still has confidence in the CDC to lead the country's response to the pandemic, Navarro said that ""you should ask the president that question, not me.""

In April, The Washington Post reported that the CDC's coronavirus testing kits were delayed due to ""a glaring scientific breakdown"" at the agency's central lab. The error was ""devastating to the country"" and ""really a terrible black mark on the CDC,"" James Le Duc, a former CDC officer, told The Post.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration later confirmed with CNBC that the ""CDC did not manufacture its test consistent with its own protocol,"" according to a spokeswoman. The agency ""was not able to determine from information provided by the CDC whether the test issues were due to a design or manufacturing issue,"" the spokeswoman said.

Speaking with CBS on Sunday, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said the CDC, which is an agency under HHS, has had to ""literally build this from the ground up"" and that it was the private sector's role to expand the CDC-developed test. He said the initial contaminated tests that the CDC developed prevented some of the scale up ""for a couple of weeks.""

In response to Navarro's comments, Azar said that he believes the CDC didn't let the country down and has always had the critical role of getting the private sector to the table.

""That was never going to be the backbone of testing, of broad, mass testing, in the United States,"" Azar told CBS, saying that was the role of companies like Abbott Laboratories, Roche and Thermo Fischer.

Former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, a CNBC contributor who sits on the boards of Pfizer and biotech company Illumina, told CBS on Sunday that even if the CDC had rolled out its early test perfectly, there still wouldn't have been enough diagnostic testing in the nation.

Azar told CNN on Sunday that the U.S. is now conducting more than 300,000 tests per day and approximately 10 million tests total. Although that's still a small portion of the country's population of approximately 328 million people.

""What needed to happen was someone needed to pick up the phone and call the CEOs of LabCorp and Quest and the other big labs probably sometime in January or at least in early February,"" Gottlieb said. He said that person would've been either Azar or FDA Commissioner Stephan Hahn.

""If they'd ask the CEOs to do that, I'm willing to bet they would've done it and you would've got the big labs in the game,"" Gottlieb said.",real

You had some exposures that may put you at risk for coronavirus. A few days later you come down with a bad cough yourself and feel a little short of breath and really tired. You take your temperature: 101 degrees. A fever.
You suspect you might have Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. The days roll into each other, and your doctor urges you to stay home unless your condition worsens. You feel pretty bad, though, and finally get an appointment.
They test you for influenza by sticking a swab far up your nose, and you are told the test came back negative, you don’t have flu. They tell you they are saving the Covid-19 tests for those who are even worse off than you are. You go home with a prescription for antibiotics, possibly because they don’t know what else to do, and read about celebrities who are testing positive but don’t seem so sick.
A couple of days later, still with fevers, you go back, and the doctors relent and test you for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. They again stick something up your nose to what feels like the bottom of your eyeball.
They tell you that the results will be available in a couple of days and you go home and wait. Finally, the results come back and you are told you do not have Covid-19. Now what?
This is a real patient’s story. In fact, it is a lot of people’s story — at least some version of it. Across the world, people with signs and symptoms of Covid-19 are testing negative and wondering what it means. They are not showing up in the statistics, and they are left in limbo about what to do next.
The problem may be with the test. Current coronavirus tests may have a particularly high rate of missing infections. The good news is that the tests appear to be highly specific: If your test comes back positive, it is almost certain you have the infection.
The most common test to detect the coronavirus involves a process known as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, or RT-PCR, a jumble of words that describes a method capable of detecting virus particles that are generally present in respiratory secretions during the beginning of an infection. From a technical standpoint, under ideal conditions, these tests can detect small amounts of viral RNA.
In the real world, though, the experience can be quite different, and the virus can be missed. The best the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention can say is that if you test negative, “you probably were not infected at the time your specimen was collected.” The key word there is “probably.”
False-negative test results — tests that indicate you are not infected, when you are — seem to be uncomfortably common. Increasingly, and disturbingly, I hear a growing number of anecdotal stories from my fellow doctors of patients testing negative for coronavirus and then testing positive — or people who are almost certainly infected who are testing negative.
Unfortunately, we have very little public data on the false-negative rate for these tests in clinical practice. Research coming out of China indicates that the false-negative rate may be around 30 percent. Some of my colleagues, experts in laboratory medicine, express concerns the false-negative rate in this country could be even higher.
There are many reasons a test would be falsely negative under real-life conditions. Perhaps the sampling is inadequate. A common technique requires the collection of nasal secretions far back in the nose — and then rotating the swab several times. That is not an easy procedure to perform or for patients to tolerate. Other possible causes of false negative results are related to laboratory techniques and the substances used in the tests.
So, where does that leave us? Even with more testing, we are likely to be underestimating the spread of the virus. For now, we should assume that anyone could be carrying the virus. If you have had likely exposures and symptoms suggest Covid-19 infection, you probably have it — even if your test is negative. We should all continue to practice the behaviors — rigorous hand washing, not touching the face, social distancing — that impede its spread. And we need better information about the performance of these tests — including any new tests that are introduced — in the real world.
Even as better tests emerge, we should always put the test result in the context of the other information we have. It’s a lesson that endures throughout medicine: Look at the big picture, not a single piece of data. Triangulate on the truth, using all the sources of information you have, no matter how good a single test. And don’t be shy about questioning a conclusion that doesn’t fully fit the facts.

Updated at 4:36 p.m. ET

President Trump plans to appoint a council to advise him on how best to reopen America after much of the nation went dormant to help mitigate the spread of the coronavirus.

Trump said Friday that he plans to announce on Tuesday whom he has named to make recommendations about some kind of path to normalcy.

""I'm going to surround myself with the greatest minds,"" he said in another marathon news conference at the White House. ""We're going to make a decision, and hopefully, it's going to be the right decision.""

Trump and advisers must balance economic, social, public health and other priorities. The president was asked what metrics he would use in recommending when some places might begin to attempt to get back to normal.

""The metrics right here,"" Trump said, pointing to his temple.

Danger of a bounce-back epidemic

The president was asked about reports that have suggested that a return to normalcy after about 30 days of social distancing and other countermeasures might mean a boomerang flare-up in cases later this year.

Trump said he and advisers would contemplate the possibility of an echo spike after the current surge in cases and deaths slows.

""There's always going to be a risk where something can flare up,"" he said.

The president also acknowledged that if an echo outbreak gets desperate enough in some places, another round of social distancing and other mitigation efforts could be needed.

But the United States expects to add new tools to help it battle the coronavirus, including tests and treatments, so the model for a response will change over time.

And Dr. Anthony Fauci, a top immunologist who has been advising the White House's disaster response, suggested at a briefing on Thursday that normalization might look different for different parts of the country.

All the same, if the end has come into view, the nation still must travel a difficult course to reach it, another top physician, Dr. Deborah Birx, said at Friday's briefing.

She cited data about infections and deaths that are following expectations but are not yet on a downslope.

""As encouraging as they are, we have not reached the peak,"" Birx warned.

Trump: Response supplies flowing

Trump asserted on Friday that the federal response has helped mitigate earlier shortages in masks, equipment and other supplies sought for hospitals and health care workers.

""We're in great shape in every way,"" he said. ""Ventilators, protective clothing — we're not getting any calls from governors at this moment. We're getting very few calls from governors or anybody else needing anything — we're in great shape for this surge that's coming in some areas.""

It wasn't immediately possible to assess whether, in fact, the shortfalls that have been reported in some places have been ameliorated; the president's statement followed weeks' worth of efforts to marshal, ship and produce the supplies.

Trump has, at various times, dueled with governors or other officials about the local needs or local responses to the crisis.

The president said he lamented that new predictions call for about 60,000 deaths from the pandemic but he said that outcome was preferable to the higher projections, including a range of 100,000 to 200,000 deaths.

""In the mist of grief and pain, we're seeing signs our aggressive strategy is saving countless lives,"" Trump said.

Trump and public health authorities urged Americans to continue to stay home, keep away from large groups and take the other precautions urged to slow the spread of the virus. The countermeasures are working, officials say.

Questions about process for normalization

With confidence now strengthened about the validity of the social distancing strategy and early indications about the end coming into sight, discussion has turned to how America may be able to get back to normal.

The White House's advisers suggest that there won't be one plan that applies everywhere.

""I don't think there are going to be benchmarks that are going to be consistent from one [area] to the other,"" Fauci said on Thursday.

Trump has been under pressure to at least announce an end date to the countermeasures, such as the call for staying home and avoiding large groups, which have amounted to a medically induced coma for much of the U.S. economy.

Restaurants, brick-and-mortar retailers, travel and other industries have been paralyzed; some 17 million people applied for unemployment benefits in the past few weeks.

With at least a theoretical decrease in sight to new infections and deaths, Trump and Vice President Pence say they're eager to begin assessing how sections of the United States could return to something like normal, permitting people to move more freely and return to work.

Trump said on Friday that's the assignment he'll give to the new council he plans to appoint, which he said would include ""great business, great doctors — we're going to have have a great group of people.""

That also could include governors, potentially even Democratic governors, Trump said at another point in the briefing in response to a question.

Long path to implementation

Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told NPR this week that his agency is working on a plan for normalization, but his comments suggested the necessity for a major and as-yet-incomplete effort.

First, the nation needs more coronavirus testing, Redfield said, especially testing with rapid results to render quicker diagnoses. Public health authorities also are looking ahead to new tests that can show whether a person had the virus in the past and may be carrying antibodies.

Second, Redfield said, the United States must vastly expand contact tracing to find people who are connected with those who become infected.

Loading...

Under those practices, public health authorities work from a person known to be sick through all the other people with whom she or he has had contact — to see how many of them might be infected.

Many people who get the coronavirus don't show any symptoms, but they still can transmit it to others who do become sick. That's why identifying everyone who has it, in whichever form, is so important to constraining the outbreak.

Redfield said an eventual national program to test and contact-trace would need to be executed by local health authorities, with the guidance and assistance of the CDC.

Presumably, once officials have a good sense about where and how the infection stands in, for example, a metropolitan area, they could then begin to decide when stores and business could reopen.

Attempt to negotiate oil deal

Trump also said on Friday that negotiations continue among oil-producing nations about a production cut in order to stabilize prices.

Global demand for energy has been in a tailspin as one consequence of social distancing — fewer Americans are driving to work, shipping goods, making deliveries and so forth. That hurts the oil industry, and Trump already has warned about layoffs in the energy sector in the United States.

Trump said on Friday that he had spoken with Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador about getting Mexico onboard with a global production cut.

Mexico is an oil producer but not a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which has a strong influence on production and prices — and which already has announced that it will pump less crude.

Trump suggested that the United States would ""help Mexico along"" with a cut to its own production that would enable Mexico to reduce its output by a smaller concomitant amount. Mexico would then ""reimburse"" the United States later for whatever accommodation Washington makes now on oil production, Trump said.

The president said he and López Obrador had agreed on that detail, but other oil-producing nations haven't yet signed on.

""We're working on it,"" Trump said. ""Eventually it's going to work out.""",real

In the UK, 248,818 people have tested positive for the virus, and 545 deaths were recorded on Tuesday, pushing the death toll to 35,341.

Here is your daily briefing of coronavirus news you may have missed overnight.

The 100-year-old Second World War veteran who raised millions for the NHS during lockdown is to be knighted.

NHS porters and cleaners and social care staff do not qualify for a Home Office scheme that grants families of health workers indefinite leave to remain in the UK if they die of coronavirus, it was revealed.

The GMB union said the exclusion of some of the NHS’s lowest paid workers was an “outrageous scandal”.

Around 8 per cent of social care home workers are non-EU migrants, who also make up a large number of those who work as hospital cleaners, porters, security guards and catering staff who are considered key workers but have been left out of the scheme.

Lola McEvoy, NHS organiser for the GMB union, called the policy “heartless” and said it leaves the lowest-paid key workers “out in the cold”.

“We ask them to take the maximum risk – but they get minimal reward. They have been drafted to the front of the fight on Covid-19 and if – as so many have – they lose their lives in doing so, their families are not looked after,” she said.

“It’s only right that they’re offered the same security and peace of mind as directly-employed NHS staff – after all they face the same dangers.”

An extra bank holiday to be put in place in October is reportedly being considered by the government as a way to help the tourism industry recover from the repercussions of coronavirus.

The UK’s tourism agency Visit Britain put forward the proposal for an extra day off near half-term, reported the BBC.

The government told the BBC it will ‘respond in due course” to the agency’s proposal, but warned that having an extra break does “come with economic costs”.

Head of Visit Britain, Patricia Yates, reportedly argued that an extra bank holiday in October would help the industry mitigate the benefits lost from the two bank holidays in May, as people remained in lockdown at the time.

UK Hospitality, a trade group for leisure businesses, also supported the idea of an extra bank holiday, but expressed caution.

Chief executive Kate Nicholls told the BBC: “A bank holiday in October may provide a welcome boost for hospitality businesses, not least at a time when consumer confidence will hopefully be returning to healthy levels.

“However, we are still some way from knowing what the sector will look like. A lot depends on whether businesses are able to open safely and whether the government continue to support businesses who need it.”

The University of Cambridge will hold all “face-to-face lectures” virtually until the next academic year, it has confirmed.

The university becomes the first to set out such measures for the full 2020/21 academic year and it says it is “likely” that social distancing will continue to be required.

However, it may be possible for smaller teaching groups to take place in person if it “conforms to social distancing requirements”.

A spokesman for the university said: “The University is constantly adapting to changing advice as it emerges during this pandemic.

“Given that it is likely that social distancing will continue to be required, the university has decided there will be no face-to-face lectures during the next academic year.

“This decision has been taken now to facilitate planning, but as ever, will be reviewed should there be changes to official advice on coronavirus.”

An animal sanctuary in California chartered two planes in their latest mission to rescue 1,000 chickens from a farm in Iowa before they could be euthanised during the coronavirus pandemic.

With the coronavirus pandemic shutting down the cruise industry for several months, Caribbean islands have been left in limbo, facing hard choices on what comes next, when and if cruise ships return.

Most islands in the Caribbean are highly dependent on tourism, with cruise ships and the related services that they provide responsible for a large percentage of jobs for residents. While the mid-March shutdown came after the Caribbean's high season, a full summer without the regular work that cruise ships bring in could have lasting economic consequences.

At the same time, most islands have limited health care facilities; an influx of coronavirus cases from tourists, both on land or sea, could prove devastating to residents. Discussions on the islands are centering on that paradox: how to bring back the tourists who fuel the economy without endangering the people who live there.

CruiseCritic.com is checking in with major ports in the Caribbean to see how the conversations are going. Here's what the cruise website is hearing.

U.S. Virgin Islands

Home to St. Thomas, one of the Caribbean's busiest cruise ports, the U.S.V.I. have been under the same health restrictions and warnings as parts of the United States and have been following regulations set out by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Tourists will be permitted to return to the islands June 1, but cruise ships won't come back until much later, as the lines work out their agreements with the CDC, Joseph Boschulte, Commissioner of Tourism for the territory, told Cruise Critic in an interview.

The mid-March timing of the cruise line shutdown came after most of the islands' high season, which runs from November through the end of March/early April, had already occurred, Boschulte said. Still, the revenues stopped from mid-March on, leaving the island without the crucial spring break income and run up to the Easter holidays, he said.

""We have gone from a trajectory of having a little over 1.5 million cruise customers in the territory for this fiscal year … and then we went to zero,"" Boschulte said. Summer traditionally has been a softer season for the Caribbean, but St. Thomas still averages between 100,000 to 115,000 cruise visitors in May and June; those two months alone represent a loss of nearly $36 million.

The Virgin Islands government and tourism interests have been talking regularly to the cruise lines about their plans to return, both individually and through the Florida-Caribbean Cruise Association. Discussions center around how lines not only can ensure that passengers stay safe from COVID-19 during port stops, but also how the island can protect its residents from getting ill, Boschulte said.

Testing for the virus has become a cornerstone in requirements for lines returning, but questions remain as to who does it – and when – the minister said. ""What do we do after they come back from touring or on the beach – do we test them before they go back on board or does the ship?""

Any excursion that takes place in St. Thomas will have to follow local health and safety protocols, Boschulte said. ""Even when the bars and restaurants open, the expectation is that you will wear a mask,"" he said. Shore excursion operators and even the popular ferry to St. John could also require masks. ""The next layer of questions become, 'Do (passengers) have to bring their own, or will the shore excursion company provide it?""

Boschulte also notes the island will need time to prepare safely, to make sure that residents who interact with tourists have the equipment they need, such as masks and hand sanitizer. ""That's taxi people, that's people who work the security at the gates, that's people who work the beaches, the restaurants and the bars.""

Another big unknown that will affect St. Thomas: What will capacity be on the first ships that arrive? St. Thomas is a port for some of the industry's largest ships, such as Royal Caribbean's Symphony of the Seas, which carries up to 6,000 passengers. ""Now if they only sail at 50% capacity, that's a much different model for us a port to manage,"" Boschulte said.

""Until we get a vaccine, I think we are going to have to err on the side of most caution,"" he said. ""What I can tell you is that we're cautiously optimistic that over the next few months, we will get closer to having adequate testing and a very thorough protocol safety set of initiatives for the cruise industry that we, as travelers, can have confidence in what's being put in place, and also that the residents of a highly traveled cruise ship destination feel comfortable that guests coming back in doesn't jeopardize the quality of their health.""

Puerto Rico

A home port for Southern Caribbean cruises, Puerto Rico was expecting 108 cruise ships in San Juan between May and September 2020. While the island is still evaluating the exact loss in revenue, the impact is being felt by a diverse group of businesses, including retail shops, tour operators, transportation businesses, harbor bunkering services and local suppliers.

The process of safely welcoming visitors again has been a top concern; the island has 80,000 people employed in tourism, which makes up 6.5% of Puerto Rico's GDP, Brad Dean, CEO of Discover Puerto Rico, told Cruise Critic.

He noted that the island was the first U.S. destination to implement measures such as an island-wide curfew and thermographic cameras to take temperatures of travelers coming into Puerto Rico at the San Juan airport. Other measures include implementation of intensive screening, enhanced sanitation, quarantine zones, on-site medical personnel and additional disinfection of local facilities.

Expect to see buffets, salad bars and self-service restaurants eliminated in tourism businesses, Dean said. Reusable menus will not be available. Lodging for pre- and post-cruise stays will have island-specific certification cards, and guests will receive a health and safety guide from each property.

Puerto Rico is well poised as a destination that can return in the post-COVID-19 world, Dean said, pointing out the island's abundant outdoor attractions and beaches.

""The Puerto Rican community has hospitality in its DNA and will undoubtedly welcome visitors back with open arms and the warmth that it did following past adversity,"" he said.

St. Kitts

With fantastic beaches as well as UNESCO historical sites, St. Kitts has become an important and popular stop on Caribbean cruise itineraries, on both Eastern and Southern routes.

The island was projected to receive 45 cruise calls between May and September 2020, with 166,936 projected passengers. The loss of that income, based on cruise passenger spend alone, is more than $18 million, according to Racquel Brown, CEO of the St. Kitts Tourism Authority.

""We began to see an impact as early as February and March to our cruise sector, which makes up a significant portion of our tourism industry as a whole and contributes approximately $136 million in passenger spend alone to our economy per year,"" she told Cruise Critic. ""Add to that about another $7 million including passenger fees, fuel charges, taxes, navigation services and so on, so the scope of the economic impact becomes very clear.""

Cruising has helped St. Kitts grow a bustling summer tourism season, with at least two ships a week. ""There are many of our nationals who depend on the cruise industry, and the impact has been felt greatly. It has affected our vendors, who depend on the industry for their daily living, our beach vendors, our water sports operators, our taxi and tour bus operators and our hotels. Business owners have had to reduce staff hours or lay off staff. This has been difficult, as they have grown over the years from St. Kitts' vibrant cruise industry and at present there is no demand to sustain the amount of business they have grown accustomed to transacting.""

The island country, which includes sister Nevis – a port for small and luxury cruise ships – has been working with the FCCA and other Caribbean countries for a ""careful and phased"" reopening plan, she said.

""The ability to meet the established CDC guidelines will be our first step to the cruise sector resuming business,"" Brown said. ""As a destination, we will adhere to CDC guidelines and protocols for the cruise industry as well as the guidelines provided by our Ministry of Health,"" which follows World Health Organization protocol.

""Of course, we know that social distancing protocols will have to be observed, the use of hand sanitizers, the washing of hands and the use of personal protective equipment in order to ensure the safety of our guests and our citizens and residents.""

What makes the COVID-19 crisis different from the hurricanes that often disrupt Caribbean tourism is the sheer scope, she said. With hurricanes, governments have emergency plans in place, and tourists often visit as soon as they can to help support the destination, which gives the country some level of control.

""The entire cruise industry is closed, the borders are closed. We have never had a no-sail order that has restricted the entire cruise sector,"" she said.

While some islands might take the pause to consider issues of overtourism, Brown said that St. Kitts built cruising gradually and sees its growth as controlled. ""The people of St. Kitts enjoy and appreciate the cruise industry and look forward to the time when we can safely welcome visitors to our shores again.""

He was never alone for long.

Inevitably, someone would spot the legendary high school football coach and stop by to say hello, to share a story, but most often to ask his advice.

“He couldn’t be out there 10 minutes before someone would come up,” said his son, Wayne Reese Jr. “I would hear the stories all the time. Just the other day someone told me, ‘You know, your father is the reason that I am the man I am today.’”

In New Orleans, a city weathered both by natural and socioeconomic storms, Coach Reese was both a pillar and a safe harbor.

He knew success on the field – amassing 250 career wins and seeing players like hall-of-fame running back Marshall Faulk reach the NFL – and off it, where he coached generations of young people – now lawyers, general contractors, bus drivers and educators – on how to win at life.

Spring was typically the time when Reese and Frank Daggs, 42, his longtime assistant coach at McDonogh 35 High School, took their players around the region to watch college scrimmages. They were opportunities for the kids to see what it took to play at the next level and to connect with coaches and scouts who might have scholarships to offer.

But by March 13, the day Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards ordered all state schools to close in response to the coronavirus, Reese was suffering the symptoms of what he thought was a cold.

Less than three weeks later, on April 2, he took his last breaths from a ventilator in a makeshift coronavirus wing of Tulane Hospital in New Orleans. He was 75 and is survived by his wife, Stella Chase Reese, and four children and six grandchildren.

A month after Reese’s death, current and former players said they miss their coach’s presence the most. “When Coach Reese talked, you listened,” said Clifford Chattman, now a 22-year-old senior defensive back at Texas A&M.

Chattman was 13, a shy, indifferent student, when Reese came to his seventh grade class and spoke with the boy, already a star on his rec league football team. During the meeting, the coaches didn’t talk with him about football, and they didn’t try to recruit him. Reese simply asked the boy about himself and how he was doing in school.

“He didn’t even know whether I would be playing for him then,” Chattman said. “So for him to already be known as this legendary coach, and he shows up at my school, and he’s there to see me? That told me a lot about him right then.”

After Chattman came to play at McDonogh 35, Reese was unrelenting about the importance of good grades and taught Chattman to ask his teachers for help if he struggled in class. When colleges came recruiting, Reese urged him to pick the school where he felt most at home. Chattman will earn his bachelor’s degree this summer in youth development.

“Coach told me, ‘No matter the situation in life, just be yourself. You’ll always go the furthest in life by being yourself,’” Chattman said.

For Reese, that meant being the rock that everyone around him could lean on. They saw it three years ago when one of his players, Devin “Duke” Winters, passed away from a sudden heart attack the morning he was supposed to leave for a visit to Syracuse University.

Reese was returning from a coaching seminar when he heard the news, his friend and athletic director Kevin Sanders said. Instead of going home, Reese and the other coaches huddled at school to brainstorm how best to support Duke’s family and classmates.

Sanders said he never saw Reese shed a tear for his fallen player; he was too busy being the shoulder for others to cry on. “The school is a safe haven for most of the kids,” Sanders said. “As a PE teacher, (Reese) basically touched every student in the building.”

Up until the day Reese left his office for the last time, Sanders said the coach had a photograph of Winters in his window. His voice welled with emotion as he recalled his son recently pointed out that April 2, the day Reese died, was also Duke’s birthday.

“He said ‘Duke got the best birthday present ever,’” Sanders said. “‘He got his coach back.’”

In the end, Reese never told his son anything was wrong. Wayne Reese Jr. always had to go to his mother to learn if anything was wrong. She told him his father wasn’t feeling well.

The last time he spoke with his father, Reese Jr., also a high school head coach who twice went head to head with his father’s teams, had to hold back his own tears as his father told him that all he wanted to do was go home.

“I had to tell him: ‘You’re not the coach right now, you’re the player. And the doctors, they’re the coaches. So if they say you have to stay there right now, then that’s what you have to do.’”

After his death, Reese’s students, colleagues and friends organized a drive-by caravan around the school to honor him within social distancing rules.

A trumpet player from the school’s band played the alma mater next to the school’s marquee, which bore Reese’s name along with a tribute that read: “The man, the legend, our coach!”

What breaks his son’s heart is that his father, who spent most of his life surrounded by people, died in the hospital bed without family and close friends.

Even now, he says, his father's spirit is not far from him. Its echoes are in the words he shared with generations of students and with those who couldn’t pass without stopping by the coach’s front porch to seek his counsel.

“With things I’ve dealt with just these past few weeks, in my mind, I’m thinking, what would my dad do?” Reese Jr. said. “And sometimes I’ll just look up and say ‘Daddy, talk to me.’ Because he always had all the answers.”

But as global responses to the crisis reveal the efficacy of national-level strategies, it appears that such questions remain political and less based on scientific data.

Internationally-acclaimed author, journalist and academic Martin Jacques explained China's influence amid the ongoing crisis, namely relating to the country's handling of the coronavirus pandemic as well as current and future relationships with major global powers such as the United States, Great Britain and the European Union.

Sputnik: You mentioned that you had spoken to one of China's leading intellectuals on the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Can you explain how China tackled the crisis as well as public sentiment related to Beijing's handling of the outbreak?

Martin Jacques: What was striking was, due to the lockdowns across Wuhan and Hubei province, they managed to completely stop COVID-19 from spreading across China.

For example, in Beijing there were only eight deaths and seven in Shanghai. This was really remarkable when you compare it to the United States, where it spread into every state and clearly the measures taken were grossly inadequate.

Despite fumbling through the early stages, China took hold of the pandemic in mid-January and realised the scope of the threat. The measures they took suppressed the virus, and there is now a progressive but rapid opening up of the economy.

So far, there has been no spikes in new cases, with most coming from elsewhere such as foreigners and Chinese overseas students. Traffic jams have returned to big cities, evidencing a rapid economic restoration, and the mood has changed a lot.

— Martin Jacques (@martjacques) May 6, 2020

According to my friend, in January, there was a lot of criticism of the government for its handling of the epidemic, felt by a wide cross-section of people. But now the mood has reversed, firstly after China got on top of the crisis as effectively, or even more effectively, than other countries the manner I just described.

The other is watching the mess that many Western countries made of the situation, such as acting too late or failing to use the time China had given to prepare, in addition to using very variable strategies. The outstanding example being Germany and the worst Britain, with the United States being the worst globally. The mood is that now, people are feeling very good about China's response, in light of what might have happened, which is what the West has done, with a few exceptions.

Sputnik: A recent Lancet study evidenced the importance of contact tracing in stopping the spread of the pandemic in cities such as Wuhan and Shenzhen. Which measures did Chinese authorities take and how effective were they?

Martin Jacques: The first move they made was to stop people moving around using a major lockdown applied across all major Chinese cities. This was crucial to stopping the transmission, even amid the Chinese New Year, where millions of people move around the country, inevitably fomenting the spread of the disease.

Secondly, they took everyone's temperature. China has very good on-the-ground means of checking, inspecting and controlling, with residents at apartment blocks in cities receiving temperature checks before entering the premises, and if a COVID-19 infection was suspected, tests were immediately given. If results were positive, you were quarantined and contacts traced via an app designed by Tencent (WeChat).

The programme was rolled out on a nationwide basis, and even now, despite the virus being fundamentally under control, they still use an app system to monitor the situation, using three colours--red, green and amber.

Green means you're virus-free and can do the maximum of what's allowed, amber restricts some movements due to prior or suspected infections and red confirms a diagnosis and imposes a 14-day quarantine, with close monitoring of the population with contact tracing.

Efforts were also boosted by the fact people expect the government to intervene, stemming from Confucian traditions where people respect and look up to authorities with both looked at as one. This is in contrast to some nations, with extremes such as the US, where the government is widely viewed as a threat rather than a friend.

Sputnik: US president Donald Trump has continued the US trade war on China and launched a campaign against Beijing amid the pandemic, accusing the latter of leaking COVID-19 from the Wuhan Institute of Virology and 'covering-up' the outbreak. Why specifically is he and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo doing this in the absence of support from international bodies, the scientific community and even the Pentagon?

Martin Jacques: You don't need to be a rocket scientist to know what he's up to here. America's COVID-19 response has been a disaster. He's been completely irresponsible and denied there was a problem and even talked about it being a hoax. He didn't think it would ever happen in the US and thought it was a 'Chinese problem'. As a result, the country flew blind.

Inevitably, the virus spread to the States in March and April, and I think that, to avoid the responsibility and embarrassment at home, tried to distract and deflect criticism by blaming China for the pandemic, firstly by calling it the 'Chinese' or 'Wuhan' virus, as if viruses have borders or nationality.

He later claimed, despite overwhelming consensus from scientists, that the virus originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. I think it's nonsense, actually, and an attempt to cover up for presiding over a disaster across the US.

The origins and development of viruses are difficult to determine, and it's a job for scientists. French scientists stated that the first cases in France began in November or December, in line with China's cases, and Italy believes their cases originated in Germany around January or February, indicating it dates back further than most are talking about, possibly in a lesser, asymptomatic form or with milder symptoms, but became more aggressive after developing in Wuhan.

I read the other day that there were 14 variants of the disease, with the East Coast in the US having a more virulent strain than the West Coast.

So I think this is not about science, but about politics, and I'm concerned about what's emanating from the White House. The deterioration in relations between the US and China were at the behest of Washington, with a sharp departure from Sino-US relations underpinned since 1972, where China was to be regarded as a competitor, but is now seen as a threat.

In regards to COVID-19, the pandemic has moved to the centre of the argument, taking precedence over the US-China trade war. Trump mentioned on Thursday evening that COVID-19 was a greater threat to American life than Pearl Harbour or 9/11. He doesn't say that China is an enemy and is responsible, but accuses Beijing of failing to stop the disease.

This is very disturbing because it's poisoning the relationship with China. COVID-19 is going to be a key moment in history, namely in the last few decades, because of China's economic rise to power. But with COVID-19, the argument has shifted from a narrow question of economics to a question of governance, which the West has long regarded as its area of advantage. But the global response to the pandemic will shift the argument in favour of Beijing.

Sputnik: What do you believe is the future of Sino-British ties after the pandemic? How have relations change from previous administrations and will London follow Washington or follow an independent strategy?

Martin Jacques: During the [former Prime Minister] David Cameron and [Chancellor of the Excheqers] George Osborne government, Britain pursued a relatively cooperative and strong economic relationship. They welcomed Chinese investment, nuclear power, Huawei as an important investor, and an expanding range of cooperation.

Then, after the Cameron government fell and [Former Prime Minister] Theresa May was elected, the relationship didn't deteriorate, but went into a period of stagnation. Nothing was reversed but the growth in friendship was not resumed, either.

PM Boris Johnson has continued his predecessor's position, now with the important question of Huawei's 5G partnership, who was allowed 30 percent of the market. But there is a backlash mainly in the Conservative Party which wants to review Sino-UK ties, or even roll them back altogether or perceive China as a threat, obviously influenced by Trump's rise.

Relations have definitely cooled and suspicions deepened due to China growing stronger, moving from a fast-growing economy but not rivalling Western levels of technology, to China becoming a technological power and innovator, and sections of the UK have attempted to pigeonhole Beijing as a competitor or threat.

In the long run, this is a totally unsustainable position because Beijing is on the rise and the second-largest global economy, and is a leader in numerous technologies, and these ties will be essential.

It's not like in the former Soviet Union which was never strong in these areas save for the military, and China is and will continue to be a major economic success.

You can't just refuse to deal with a country like that, especially without ""cutting your nose to spite your face"". You may be able to do that to lesser countries not seen as competitors, but not to China, who has so much of the technology we are going to need.

Regarding COVID-19, a lot of essential supplies are made in China and no longer in the UK and other countries. So such a position is unsustainable in the long term, but in the short term could become more influential.

Europe has also been affected by the deterioration in Sino-US relations, and Europeans by and large don't follow or even like President Trump, but nevertheless feels challenged by China's rise and are concerned about how to 'defend' or 'protect' itself from Beijing, for example, the challenge the Belt and Road Initiative poses to the European Union.

I believe if we had the Cameron-Osborne approach to Sino-British ties, I may be more optimistic. But under the current position, I think they will worsen over a long time, namely in the context of COVID-19.

Many countries will go through a very painful period, much more than after the 2010 financial crisis, with a lot of dissatisfaction and people looking for someone to blame, who will blame Beijing in the Trump manner.

A recent poll revealed that roughly between two-thirds and three-fourths of the US population feel negative about China, pointing to a presidential election in November where Trump will play the anti-China card big time.

MMA promoter claims Khabib's father Abdulmanap was sick for 10 DAYS before receiving assistance,"Abdulmanap Nurmagomedov, who is in a medically-induced coma with heart problems complicated by COVID-19, suffered without treatment for 10 days in Dagestan before receiving the necessary medical assistance.

The UFC lightweight champion’s father was feeling ill in Dagestan but faced a long wait before receiving medical attention because of a lack of understanding about the deadly virus in his homeland, Russian MMA promotion Fight Nights Global boss Kamil Gadzhiev has claimed.

Promoter Gadzhiev has said he was in touch with Nurmagomedov before the revered trainer was admitted to the Moscow hospital where he is now on a life support machine, and believes he could have caught COVID-19 as a result of one of the mass events that continued in the country while the outbreak spread.

“We talked when he was ill in Dagestan,” Gadzhiev told Sport Express.

“Abdulmanap did not really receive assistance for ten days. Why didn’t they help? Maybe they didn’t understand that it was COVID. Maybe there were no necessary preparations.

“When we corresponded, the risks of the coronavirus were not yet known – even less so in Dagestan. They were not ready to withstand the coronavirus. Why did he get infected? Probably because of mass events, be it a wedding or a funeral.

“Abdulmanap is one of those people who are very much talked about today in the context of the Dagestan coronavirus as a whole. There are people who have not been given proper medical care. There are almost no people left in Dagestan who have not been affected by the coronavirus.

“This is not the fault of doctors. In general, I won’t specifically blame anyone. I’ll just say that people in our republic treated the virus quite negligently. What happened to Abdulmanap is a certain result of [this], unfortunately.”

The 57-year-old was first hospitalized in Dagestan in late April, receiving treatment in regional capital Makhachkala for symptoms reported as being similar to those associated with pneumonia.

When his condition worsened, he was privately flown to a military hospital in Moscow, where he was announced last week as being in a coma following a heart operation.

His middle son, who has a flawless record in 28 UFC contests, provided an update to fans on Instagram on Monday amid reports of his father’s deterioration.

Thirty-two companies responded to the survey, and that’s just a fraction of the state’s dance organizations. In Chicago alone, See Chicago Dance reports having more than 88 members, and at least 100 additional companies use its marketing resources.

Put simply, the state’s dance scene has taken a body blow. Indeed, industry leaders fear that some companies won’t recover from this crisis at all and others could come back in a weakened or reduced form.

“Not only the Joffrey, for all of us, it’s a precarious time,” said Ashley Wheater, artistic director of the Joffrey Ballet. “And the arts are so fragile as it is.”

Kevin Iega Jeff, co-founder and creative director of Deeply Rooted Dance Theater, believes his company can get by as long as the restrictions related to COVID-19 conclude by May. “If it goes beyond that, then we are starting to get into real trouble.”

One ray of hope could come Wednesday. State and city officials are expected to announce a relief fund for the Illinois cultural sector to be administered by the Arts Alliance. Funds would come from the City of Chicago and private and corporate donors.

In addition, the recently passed $2.2 trillion stimulus bill includes $75 million each for the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for Humanities. These agencies will distribute 40 percent to state and regional arts agencies for re-granting, and the rest will go directly to applicant organizations nationwide.

Moreover, according to Americans for the Arts, qualifying arts organizations will be able to apply for other emergency help contained in the stimulus bill. Such aid includes $5 billion in community development block grants and $350 billion in emergency loans from the Small Business Administration.

“I do think if there is not a concentrated effort to support arts organizations through this, they will be missed,” said Vershawn Sanders-Ward, founder and artistic director of the Red Clay Dance Co. “People won’t really realize it until we’re on the other side of this and they see who is no longer there for their community.”

According to the Arts Alliance survey, nearly 2,500 dance performances and programs statewide have been affected by the COVID-19 shutdown. Here is a quick look at its impact on six Chicago companies:

Deeply Rooted Dance Theater (annual budget, $1.1 million) . The company, which marks its 25 th anniversary in 2021, expects to take a $700,000 hit. It announced March 25 that it was postponing “GOSHEN,” an ambitious new collaboration with Broadway in Chicago that was to include possible touring.

The company, which champions classical Indian dance, has been forced to cancel performances set for March, April and May. It hopes it won’t have to nix its annual summer dance camp, which earns the company $130,000, in late July.

The company, which champions classical Indian dance, has been forced to cancel performances set for March, April and May. It hopes it won’t have to nix its annual summer dance camp, which earns the company $130,000, in late July. Red Clay Dance Co. (annual budget $311,000). The company has had to eliminate its spring program, “Visions and Voices,” and its annual fundraiser, which annually nets as much as $10,000. If it cannot restart its programs by the end of June, it expects to take a $70,000 hit.

With all these cutbacks, dancers are hurt the most. Deeply Rooted, for example, has had to furlough its dozen dancers and is trying to find a way to give them at least some partial remuneration. Joffrey is keeping its 46 dancers on salary through April 3, then hopes to shift the remaining three to four weeks of their 40-week contract to the summer.

To get through this tough time, dance companies are falling back on cash reserves and slashing expenses. Ensemble Español is considering a GoFundMe campaign, and Red Clay plans to seek emergency help through on-line and texting fundraising platforms it already has.

At the same time, organizations are looking to their long-time supporters for supplemental assistance. Joffrey’s canceled spring fundraiser, Center Stage, has turned into what Wheater calls an “un-gala,” because many attendees are still giving the amounts they committed to the event.

Besides turning to the internet as a way to simply stay in touch with their audiences, some companies, such as the Natya Dance Theatre, are using Zoom and other on-line platforms as a way to keep classes going and maintain some revenue. But artistic director Hema Rajagopalan concedes it has been tough for many reasons, including students not having viable spaces to move at home.

Despite all these challenges, company leaders are trying to stay as positive as possible. Perez is already looking ahead to Ensemble Español’s upcoming 45th anniversary.

“We’ve got to continue to do that,” Perez said. “Move forward. Think ahead. I know this is a setback. It is a new normal that we’ve been hit with, but I think it is so important to keep the art form going.”

We have become part of a mass scale human experiment in government control and it turned out that stripping away our freedom wasn’t all that difficult. Under the guise of concern for our health and well-being, tyrants came out of the woodwork. Our Constitution, our Bill of Rights, and our lives are being destroyed as the left solidifies and expands their oppressive powers. We’ve been herded around like cattle, threatened, isolated, confined, silenced, and arrested. You name it, it’s happening.

You tell me if what follows sounds like the United States, or China.

We’ve been told who can work and who can’t, with language that separates us according to who is and who isn’t “essential” as the almighty State supersedes individual rights and the family unit.

We’ve been physically and verbally harassed, threatened, fined, detained, arrested, jailed, and/or placed in forced quarantine. Business licenses have been revoked. Going to work without the permission of the government is now a crime. So is going to the park or a beach. Children playing together is also in defiance of the government. So is placing flags on the graves of veterans. The list of infractions goes on and on and on and on. Examples read like the manifesto of a demented madman. (here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here)

A talking drone warns Savannah, GA residents to maintain social distancing (YouTube screen grab)

Stay home. Do not go out. Do not earn money. Do not pay your bills, feed your family, maintain your credit rating, live your life. Do not make a single move without permission from the State or you will be punished.

Do not dare go to church. They have been shut down, some threatened with permanent closure. Even services that maintained social distancing were not tolerated. (here, here, here, here, here)

Religion cannot thrive in a totalitarian state, as the state must reign supreme.

Meanwhile, as churches are closed, jails are opened -- criminals are released en masse, including child predators, rapists, and murderers. Prisoners, wise to the ruse, are now intentionally infecting themselves so they can be released early. And the left can’t get enough of it. (here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here)

In several places, our right to protest has been stripped away as has our right to promote protests. Tech tyrants are involved, shutting down social media for those trying to spread the word about peaceful gatherings. The Bill of Rights has been set on fire and tossed off the top of a skyscraper as a police state rushes in. (here, here, here, here, here, here)

We’ve been subjected to inhumane separations, as the oldest among us are left to suffer alone in nursing homes, senior care facilities, and hospitals where there is often an impenetrable wall of secrecy surrounding patients.

Meanwhile, “contact tracing” has become the next frontier to advance the police state as fascist tech gets in on the act, tracking our every move. The government will hunt you down, find you, and force you and other members of your household to stay in your home, even if there’s no food in the house. The quarantine cycle could leave an entire household locked up for weeks and weeks on end, with no end in sight as we are essentially placed under house arrest. Strategies for how to identify people who’ve met certain criteria have been discussed, including government issued armbands. (here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here)

To help the government keep us in line, we’ve been encouraged to snitch on our neighbors and hotlines have been set up for us to do just that. (here, here, here, here, here)

And in keeping with the good for me, but not for thee reality of all oppressive regimes, many prominent leftists have broken their own rules so they could meet their lover, go golfing, take a walk with their family, get a haircut, and so on, all the while pointing their fingers and admonishing us little people to stay inside and do as we’re told. (here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here)

For the most part, law enforcement has been willing to follow these tyrannical orders, often with multiple officers arriving on the scene.

As for the American Civil Liberties Union, not only are they missing in action, they’re part of the cabal of tyrants with upside down values, evidenced by the message featured on their home page which states their priorities as follows:

“…protect voting rights, demand that vulnerable people in prisons, jails and immigration detention centers be released, and fight to ensure reproductive health care remains open and accessible to all who need it…”

In other words, voter fraud, prisoner release, illegal invader released, and abortion. (here)

All of this unfolds against the backdrop of an aggressive media campaign to parrot China’s talking points, replete with lavish praise for the communist regime that waged war against the entire world. There’s been a cascade of fools eager to align themselves with WHO and China, including many prominent individuals. The rush to embrace our enemies has resulted in silencing speech, as words such as “Wuhan flu” are deemed “hate speech.” Punishment to be determined. (here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here)

And while the lust for power underpins this shocking spectacle, it’s wrapped up in the guise of “safety.” Who could possibly question a doctor in a white coat touting such an idea? No good totalitarian regime would be without its idealized worldview to sell fools down the river.

And so we’ve sailed, as our economy has collapsed, Americans have been controlled, law enforcement has complied, and people are bombarded with fearful messages every hour of every day – messages riddled with distorted information and lies, from bogus models to inflated mortality rates and everything in between, all of which serve to strengthen the left’s case against Trump while corrupt hospital administrators rake in money from cooking the books on cause of death. But perhaps more than that, it’s easier to control people who feel desperate and afraid. (here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here)

An exhausted and increasingly impoverished populace does not a healthy nation make. In fact, if you think this is bad, what could await is even more terrifying. As Dennis Praeger wrote in March:

…Economic disasters rarely remain only economic disasters. To give a particularly dramatic example, the Nazis came to power because of economics more than any other single reason…Nazi success at the polls was almost entirely related to the Weimar economy. Communist parties don’t fare well in robust economies, but they’re very tempting when people are in dire economic straits. Only God knows what economic dislocation the shutting down of American and other Western economies will lead to. I am not predicting a Nazi or communist ascendancy, but economic and political disaster may be as likely, or even more likely, than a health disaster.

It is quite apparent by now that even if the most horrific scenario as described above does not unfold, we have already sealed our fate with respect to a disaster of monumental proportions that runs the gamut from increased drug and alcohol addiction, increased domestic violence, suicide, and avoidance of medical care, among other concerns. Tragically, the things that put human beings at risk for many of these dire outcomes are the very things that are being thrust upon us: unemployment and isolation. At the same time, one of the most powerful forces that serves as a protective factor offering comfort and hope has been denied us, as Americans have been barred from attending church. (here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here)

As for the oft-cited idea that we are at war with an invisible enemy, I would say, no, we are not. When nations go to war, they do so to defend their culture and way of life. Instead, we are destroying ours.

But there is a war being waged. The left is determined to take this nation down and the perfect time arrived to go in for the kill. Maximum suffering, pain, and destruction is on the menu and they’re serving it up every day as they plunge small towns, cities, counties, and states into protracted lockdowns and shifting goalposts.

The scale of human suffering and the long-term effects of this are incalculable. They will not be seasonal, like a virus. They will be long-lasting. And the left cares not a bit.

There is one thing and one thing only they desire: power. And they’re having at it. So far, the police state has been a wild success.",fake

But the cruisers will come anyway.

Michigan motorheads are already hitting the streets this May as a cure for months of cabin fever.

Woodward Avenue — nicknamed “The COVID 500” by local residents — has been busy as spring weather brought out everything from classic sedans to modified hot rods to modern muscle cars. The Michigan Car Cruise Calendar Facebook page is teeming with posts as members share car gatherings and personal car updates.

In Rochester Hills last Wednesday a group of enthusiasts organized the “Afternoon Cruise” which attracted some 100 cars for a leisurely mid-day drive up and down Hamlin Street. Well, mostly leisurely. Some participants couldn’t resist the occasional tire-squealing burnout.

“We thought is was a cool idea, so quite a few of our staff members participated,” explained Kim Zeile, founder of Trans-Am racing engine maker Prefix Corp., who helped organize the event. “The area is slowly beginning to open back up, and this was a safe and fun way to get some cool vehicles out and interact with fellow car enthusiasts.”

Enthusiasts gathered over a typical smorgasbord of dream rides — Porsche 911s, Jeeps, jacked-up pickups, Ford Focus pocket rockets, ol’ '50s jalopies — in the Prefix parking lot before cruising. Prefix provided a food truck for attendees to grab a quick lunch, and Mother Nature cooperated with a beautiful afternoon.

“It meant a little taste of feeling back to normal,” said participant Jhan Dolphin. “After all, not much can compare to the freedom of rolling down the windows and going for a drive in your favorite ride.”

Woodward Avenue is Michigan’s cruising main street and recent weekends have been busy. Growling street rods have been doing patented loops around the traditional, 16-mile parade route that runs from Ferndale to Pontiac. Others have gathered in Woodward parking lots — hoods propped open to display sparkling engines underneath — as owners swap stories and urge on passing classics.

The activity starts a slow build to the official, 26th annual Dream Cruise on Saturday, Aug. 15 this year. The cruise reportedly attracts up to 1.5 million people.

Those numbers may be down this year as enthusiasts — especially older demographics — weigh the risks of COVID-19 and as authorities pressure organizers to social distance. Organizers have declined comment to date, citing the virus situation as too fluid to make plans three months out from the Cruise.

An announcement is expected in early June. Insiders say there will be changes, with participants urged to stay in their cars while communities cancel most official events.

Woodward Dream Cruise Parking, which helps cruisers find spots on the crowded route, posted on its Facebook page this week that the “Woodward Dream Cruise is going to happen this year ... however, you will see big changes. Most of the organized community events will be canceled, including entertainment, concerts, car shows, vendors, Emergency Vehicle show, kid zone, etc., to keep large crowd gatherings to a minimum.”

The Dream Cruise has always been controversial among some local residents who object to the noise and odors that the rolling traffic jam brings each summer. With added concerns over COVID-19, nerves are more on edge this year.

Paul Canvasser, a resident of Poppleton Park in Birmingham, recently wrote on Next Door that “I am fed up with the noise and racing that has overtaken Woodward. It is even more annoying since I have been isolated at home for several weeks. Everything else is shut down, but the cruising is the first thing to come back. It is time to alter this situation!”

The post received 310 community responses.

More gatherings are scheduled this weekend from Rochester to Woodward as the weather warms to 70 degrees. But critics may get their wish for a respite from the COVID 500 on Sunday. The chance of rain is 100 percent.

1378,https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/05/18/coronavirus-vaccine-first-results/,2020-05-18,Moderna’s coronavirus vaccine shows encouraging early results,"The company’s stock, along with the Dow Jones industrial average, soared on the report that eight participants who received low and medium doses of Moderna’s vaccine had blood levels of virus-fighting antibodies that were similar or greater than those in recovered covid-19 patients. That suggests, but doesn’t prove, that it triggers some level of immunity.





Moderna’s announcement comes days after one of its directors, Moncef Slaoui, stepped down from the board to become chief scientist for Operation Warp Speed, a White House initiative to speed up vaccine development. Watchdogs called out Slaoui’s apparent conflict of interest. Filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission show Slaoui’s stock options in Moderna are worth more than $10 million with the company’s share price at $66.69. In regular trading Monday, Moderna’s stock soared almost 20 percent to $80.

Moderna also received $483 million from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, a federal agency. Moderna has also partnered with a contract development and manufacturing firm, Lonza, and Slaoui stepped down from that company’s board on Monday.

Slaoui will divest his Moderna stock holdings, effective Tuesday morning, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services said Monday afternoon. He will donate the value the Moderna stock gained since Thursday, before the announcement of his position leading Operation Warp Speed, to cancer research.





Companies and countries are racing to create a coronavirus vaccine and taking on financial risk to manufacture doses in large quantities before they even know if the products are safe and effective. The U.S. is aiming to have hundreds of millions of doses of a vaccine broadly available by the end of the year.

An effort led by the University of Oxford, in partnership with pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca, plans to have millions of doses of vaccine available by fall. Last week, those researchers disclosed that more than 1,000 patients had already enrolled in the initial trial of its vaccine, which began in late April.

A Chinese company, Sinovac Biotech, recently published a study in the journal Science showing that its vaccine protected rhesus monkeys against infection and is currently being tested in 144 people. Two other safety trials are ongoing in the U.S., led by Pfizer and Inovio Pharmaceuticals.





Vaccine experts have said that these accelerated development timelines are theoretically possible, but extremely optimistic — and depend on everything going right. They stress that it will be crucial to gather convincing data the vaccines are safe and effective before using them broadly — and the new data are promising but preliminary, from the earliest phase one trials that test safety in healthy people.

“I would certainly take this as good news, and it’s certainly worth moving forward” into later stage trials, said Daniel Salmon, director of the Institute for Vaccine Safety at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “There’s just historically, if you look at vaccine development, lots of vaccines that look good out of phase one that don’t turn out to be good products.”

The data released Monday by Moderna is encouraging, but represents only a first step in a long process to bring a vaccine to market. It comes from an interim report on dozens of patients followed over weeks, whereas vaccine approval requires broad testing in thousands of patients followed over many months or years.





Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, said the data looked promising and it made sense to proceed to a large trial this summer.

“The fact that the vaccine elicited neutralizing antibody amounts comparable or higher to those found in convalescent sera [plasma] is very encouraging,” said Arturo Casadevall, chair of molecular microbiology and immunology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, who is spearheading the initiative to test plasma as a treatment.

Peter Jay Hotez, who is working on developing a coronavirus vaccine at the Baylor College of Medicine, said it would be important to understand the level of antibodies detected in the patients beyond the information provided in a company news release. He pointed to emerging evidence that many recovered patients do not muster high levels after they recover — and that high levels of antibodies may be needed to neutralize the virus.





The vaccine showed few safety signals, aside from redness at the injection site for one patient and some transient “systemic” symptoms in three patients given the highest dose — which the company will not be using in future trials.

The interim data comes from a clinical trial aimed at showing the safety of its experimental vaccine and helping the company select the correct dose. The company has not yet picked the final dose, or announced the size or length of the large trial that it will start in July, which will be the key one that regulators consider to decide whether the vaccine is safe and effective.

This month, the company received permission from the Food and Drug Administration to begin a 600-person, phase two trial to begin to test the effectiveness of the vaccine.



“We are very, very happy because first the vaccine was generally safe,” Stephane Bancel, chief executive of Moderna said in an interview. “The piece that was really exciting and was the big question, of course, was can you find antibodies in people in enough quantities” to prevent disease.



Moderna also reported that the vaccine protected mice who were vaccinated and then exposed to the virus, preventing it from multiplying in their lungs.

Moderna’s vaccine uses a genetic material called messenger RNA that codes for the distinctive spike protein that studs the outside of the novel coronavirus. The vaccine delivers the messenger RNA to cells, which then follows the genetic instructions to create the virus protein — allowing the body to learn to recognize and neutralize the pathogen.",real

Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov has been hospitalized in Moscow with a suspected coronavirus infection, Interfax reported Thursday.

Kadyrov, 43, was reportedly flown to the Russian capital Wednesday, a few days after reporting flu-like symptoms, the Baza Telegram channel reported earlier Thursday. Chechen doctors recommended that Kadyrov seek treatment there after his “condition began deteriorating rapidly,” Baza said.

The Telegram channel cited medical data as saying that Kadyrov has been diagnosed with lung damage and a suspected Covid-19 infection.

“He is under doctors’ supervision,” Interfax cited its source as saying.

A well-known transport tracker said Thursday that a private jet linked to Kadyrov arrived at Moscow’s Vnukovo Airport from the Chechen capital of Grozny.

Kadyrov’s official page on Russian social network Vkontakte has posted several updates in the past 24 hours, including posts on his charitable donations and birthday greetings for Russia’s defense minister, but has not yet addressed his alleged infection.

Kadyrov was last active on his Telegram account on Tuesday, while Instagram blocked his page last week.

483,https://www.worldhealth.net/news/latest-medical-findings-suggest-blood-clotting-covid-19/,2020-04-28,The Latest Medical Findings Suggest Blood Clotting In COVID-19,"Another mysterious and deadly complication that appears to be showing up in the front lines fighting the outbreak of COVID-19 is blood flow impeded by blood clots; the thrombotic events are occurring for a variety of reasons among those in intensive care, but the rates among COVID-19 patients are substantially higher than would otherwise be expected.

""I have had 40-year-olds in my ICU who have clots in their fingers that look like they'll lose the finger, but there's no other reason to lose the finger than the virus,"" Shari Brosnahan, a critical care doctor at NYU Langone told AFP.

After spending 3 weeks in an ICU with COVID-19 actor Nick Cordero’s doctors were forced to amputate his left leg. Another patient at NYU is suffering from lack of blood flow to both feet and hands and an amputation may be required or the blood vessels may become so damaged the extremity could fall off by itself.

Blood clots are not only dangerous to limbs they can also find their way to the lungs, heart, or brain to cause lethal pulmonary embolisms, stroke, or heart attack. A recent study from the Netherlands published in the journal Thrombosis Research indicates that 31% of 184 COVID-19 patients suffered thrombotic complications.

Another study published in the Journal of The American College of Cardiology found the risk of thrombotic complications to be so great that COVID-19 patients “may need to receive blood thinners, preventively, prophylactically,"" even before imaging tests are ordered, said Behnood Bikdeli who is a doctor at New York–Presbyterian Hospital.

Although it is not known exactly why this is happening there are several explanations such as those with severe forms of COVID-19 with underlying medical conditions such as heart or lung disease are linked to higher rates of clotting even without being infected. Also being in an ICU can make a person more likely to develop a clot as they are remaining still for too long. Infection with COVID-19 is associated with an abnormal cytokine storm immune reaction that research indicates is also linked to higher rates of blood clotting.

Something about the COVID-19 virus itself may be causing coagulation, which does have some precedent in other viral illnesses. A study published in the journal The Lancet shows that the virus can infect the inner layer of organs and of blood vessel endothelium, which could in theory interfere with the clotting process.

Brosnahan suggests that thinners may be effective in some COVID-19 patients but they may not work for all patients because the clots may be too small at times. ""There are too many microclots,"" she said. ""We're not sure exactly where they are."" In fact, autopsies have shown some people’s lungs, bowels, livers, and kidneys who have lost their battle with the virus to be filled with hundreds of microclots.

Hooman Poor, MD, a pulmonologist and critical care specialist at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, has been studying lab results of COVID-19 patients and found that many have high levels of D-dimer protein pieces, which are left over when the body breaks up blood clots, he believes that many patient’s bodies are trying desperately but failing to clear blood clots.

Around the globe those caring for COVID-19 patients are finding that when they draw blood it clots in the tubes, when catheters are inserted for kidney dialysis and IV line to draw blood the tubes quickly become clogged with clots.

""Patients are making clots all over the place,"" says Adam Cuker, MD, a hematologist and associate professor of medicine at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. ""That's making management of these patients very challenging.""

Sharon Fox, MD, PhD a pathologist at Louisiana State University Health in New Orleans has been conducting autopsies on those who have lost their battle with COVID-19, so far they share something in common, they are riddled with blood clots in the smallest vessels of the body, especially the lungs where there these tiny clots appear to have cut of blood flow to the small air sacs where blood cells would be exchanging oxygen and carbon dioxide.

“I've never had a series of cases like this, where they all look the same, and all of the lungs have a similar pattern. There are types of vascular injury at autopsy that I haven't seen before. I would say it's new,"" says Fox, adding that the pattern of damage is striking. ""There's no ability for the blood to flow through and exchange oxygen like it should,"" she says.

“We still need more controlled data, but based on clinical observations and the few studies that have been published, it looks like thrombosis [blood clotting] is more common in these patients,"" Cuker says.

This new mystery may help to solve the slightly older one, as lungs that are filled with microclots may explain why ventilators work so poorly for patients with low blood oxygen. Earlier into this outbreak doctors were treating patients with protocols developed for wet lungs, but in some cases it may not be due to the lungs being occupied with water, rather it may be that microclotting is blocking circulation and blood is leaving the lungs with less oxygen than it should.

""While we react surprised, we shouldn't be as surprised as we were. Viruses tend to do weird things,"" said Brosnahan, and while the array of complications may seem daunting, ""it's possible there'll be one or a couple of unifying mechanisms that describe how this damage happens,"" she said. ""It's possible it's all the same thing, and that there'll be the same solution.""

Another study published in the Lancet has reported evidence of viral bodies of this novel coronavirus invading endothelial cells, which is the lining of our blood vessels that directs important functions of the vascular system, like clotting and swelling. Co-author Mandeep Mehra, MD, medical director of the Brigham and Women's Heart and Vascular Center in Boston suggests this virus can directly infect the endothelium, ""This is actually a disease of the endothelium,"" he says.

Mehra thinks the infection only begins in the lungs because breathing is the easiest entry, once infected lungs cells begin to be destroyed and the virus then travels into the bloodstream where it infects endothelial cells causing endotheliitis. This comes from not only the direct infection but also from the cytokine storm that was launched to fight it off. Mehra believes his theory of infection may explain some of the puzzle to COVID-19.

This theory may explain why those with certain conditions are also the ones who get the sickest when infected, and it may help to explain why those with low blood oxygen may not have lungs as stiff as they would be in others with respiratory distress or pneumonia. One of the consequences to endotheliitis is the blood vessels are not able to constrict as normal. When a part of the lungs becomes damaged blood vessels in that area close off so that blood will flow to a part of the lung that is still working. This is to protect the body from a sudden oxygen drop, this system appears to break down with COVID-19 infection, and Mehra believes infection of the endothelium is to blame.

According to Mehra this clotting is a feature of COVID-19, when it becomes the biggest problem the disease has advanced to become very severe, for this reason treating the resulting blood clots may not work, and may explain why ventilators are not helping more patients. One study in New York City hospitals estimates that of 5,700 patitens 12% needed a ventilator but 88% of those died.

“It's not acting like influenza or other bacteria pneumonia where you get inflammation in the lungs and fluid buildup and very stiff lungs. That doesn't seem to be the case, at least early on,"" Poor says. ""The virus is acting as if its primary target is the endothelium,"" he says.

These clots may explain part of the mystery, but the clots themselves are just another part of a much larger problem, one that hopefully doctors can solve soon.",fake
1234,https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/05/cdc-publishing-covid-19-test-data/611764/,2020-05-17,State and Federal Data on COVID-19 Testing Don’t Match Up,"The data sets have one known major difference: Some states report the total number of people tested, while the CDC reports every test, even if a single person is tested more than once. A spokesperson for Indiana’s public health department pointed to this difference to explain the state’s test gap. But our analysis suggests this—or any other methodological factor—does not fully explain the widespread discrepancies. Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security, told us that one possible explanation is that the CDC could be overreporting testing totals in some states if it is including antibody-test results, which don’t track real-time infections, and underreporting in other states because of delays in paperwork. But the differences seem to be so widespread that they are unlikely to arise from a single discrepancy in how certain kinds of tests are reported. At their current rate of growth, Florida’s state-reported testing numbers would not match the CDC’s current totals for another two weeks.

“This is more evidence of the dysfunction of the CDC,” Jha said. “There is not supposed to be a lot of daylight between the CDC and the states.” Jha has previously criticized the CDC for being “inexplicably absent” during the coronavirus pandemic.

Some of the mismatch between states and the CDC could be explained by the federal government’s unusual manner of collecting testing data. Generally, disease-surveillance data flow from local public-health departments to state governments, and then on to the federal government. But in April, Vice President Mike Pence asked hospitals to start reporting their COVID-19 testing data directly to the federal government. In an email, a CDC spokesperson confirmed that the new website reflected test data from more sources than just states, saying it came from hospitals, private medical-testing companies, and state and local public-health labs.

Yascha Mounk: No testing, no treatment, no herd immunity, no easy way out

The data that Pence requested fed into a piece of software called HHS Protect, which was meant to serve as a clearinghouse of coronavirus data for the Trump administration, according to a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services. HHS Protect was developed by the defense contractor Palantir. The company declined to comment on the record.

It’s unclear exactly when the CDC site first appeared. A CDC spokesperson told us that it went live on May 7, but the first Internet Archive cache of the page is dated May 9. The CDC did not announce the existence of the page in any statement, social-media post, or press conference.

In many of the counts the CDC did provide over the past several months, it missed the large majority of tests. In early May, the CDC reported that only about half a million tests had been conducted in the U.S. But the COVID Tracking Project had tallied the results of more than 7.5 million tests reported by states by then. In late April, the White House used the COVID Tracking Project’s data in a major report on national testing strategy. It cited the data again earlier this week in a press conference.

The CDC should provide the country with a single, trustworthy data source on the state of COVID-19 testing. But the fact that its data are still in such disagreement with the state-reported totals means that the CDC’s latest efforts are not of much use to politicians and the public. For now, the agency that should be a respected source of truth in this crisis is only adding to the national confusion.

He also warns that ""simply pumping trillions"" into the financial system won't deliver a recovery on its own.

According to the International Monetary Fund, even prior to the current global recession, the real GDP growth rate per capita had been subdued or declining, public investment had been declining and the growth of investment per capita in emerging markets had also been slow.

Michael Roberts has worked as an economist with investment research firms in the City of London for over 30 years. He explains that the COVID-19 lockdowns represented the ""tipping point"" for a global economy which was already headed towards recession.

Sputnik: Jay Powell, Chair of the US Federal Reserve Bank, recently said that the current economic crisis is completely due to COVID-19 and the lockdown policies and not due to any underlying problems in the economy.

How would you respond to Powell's remarks?

Michael Roberts: Just as they did during the global financial crash in 2008-9, the monetary authorities do not want to admit that the current crisis has its origins in fault lines in the major economies. Only last September [2019], the fed was forced to inject billions in emergency liquidity when credit markets crunched. That credit squeeze reflected a significant slowdown in global growth, including [in] the US.

Most countries experienced their lowest real GDP growth rates in 2019 since the end of the great recession in 2009. Indeed, business investment was falling in most major economies; Japan and parts of Europe were already in a recession or close to it; while several large emerging economies like Mexico, Turkey, Argentina and others were in a slump. So the world economy was weakening and in no shape to handle the pandemic.

The pandemic was the tipping point.

Sputnik: Data from the International Monetary Fund and the Penn World Tables suggest that the US and other major economies were headed towards recession even before the COVID-19 lockdown.

Michael Roberts: Yes, IMF real GDP growth figures for 2019 were at their lowest in ten years. Global trade was falling and the manufacturing sectors of many major economies were contracting. Moreover corporate profits, the life blood of corporate investment, had stopped rising in the major economies, with profitability globally at lows.

Michael Roberts Global corporate profits (weighted mean) % year on year

Sputnik: Can you explain, to a lay-person, the evidence that supports this position and whether you agree with it?

Michael Roberts: In my view, business investment is the key to incomes and employment. And business investment ultimately depends on the profitability of that investment. If profitability is low and even falling, investment will suffer and that situation had already emerged in 2019 before the virus struck.

Michael Roberts Advanced economies investment and savings ratios (% of GDP)

Sputnik: Why should it matter whether or not the US and the global economy were headed towards a recession before ""The Great Lockdown""?

Michael Roberts: The reason it matters is that because the world economy was already showing signs of significant weakness and close to recession in GDP, trade and investment, then it will take much longer to come out of the pandemic slump than otherwise. Many companies (even large ones) may not return once the lockdowns are over and 'normal' business resumes.

Jobs and incomes will be permanently lost. This phenomenon is called in economics, hysteresis, where short-term damage morphs into long-term loss. That is the likely prospect now - something that Fed chair Powell admitted in his recent speech.

Sputnik: Where do you think we are headed if current government policies don't change and why?

Michael Roberts: There is optimistic talk of a V-shaped recovery, i.e. a quick return to previous GDP and investment growth ([which was] already weakening as I have argued). But that assumes lockdowns end quickly, there is no long-term damage, that there is no 'second wave' in the virus and a vaccine is found soon.

More likely, economies will have a U-shaped or even l-shaped recovery because pumping trillions of credit money into the financial system will not deliver recovery if profitability in the productive sectors remains low. What is needed is a massive government investment programme as adopted during WW2 in civilian and green projects to restore growth and employment. A 'Marshall Plan' for the pandemic.

Sputnik: How are everyday people affected by the current crisis?

Michael Roberts: Several studies show that workers earning the lowest pay and in so-called low-skill (but necessary) jobs are taking the biggest hit. Professional workers are able to work from home and have not seen much income loss. Others who must go to work are taking the biggest losses and also face the prospect of having no job to go back to or only after wages and hours cuts.

But nature can be a guide to us at this time, providing a model of cooperation, a place to heal, and ways to connect, even at the recommended distance.

Opinion

In nature, cooperation abounds.

As author Peter Wohlleben, of “The Hidden Life of Trees” explored, “[trees] send distress signals about drought and disease, for example, or insect attacks, and other trees alter their behavior when they receive these messages.” While social distancing feels like a sacrifice now, the stay at home order has saved countless lives, from high-risk populations to medical and service professionals. Altering our behavior at this critical time, just as nature does in the face of challenges, is community resilience in action.

Even at a safe distance, nature heals.

One study after another documents its positive effects on physical and mental health for people of all ages and backgrounds. Nature offers balm and solace to the weary — being a source of beauty, wonder, and inspiration. And nature can be found everywhere — including in the trees outside your apartment or home.

Nature connects us.

Looking out your window you can see it, as the birds have begun their grand migration through our region. Living in a major flyway, residents can experience this annual spectacle, just as those thousands of miles away experienced it, reminding us just how interconnected we are.

As we collectively wade through this worldwide pandemic, nature’s resilience should serve as our guide. Through collective cooperation, connection and healing, we will overcome this moment and thrive as nature blooms today.

It is only right that we take this time to reconnect with it.

Instead, WHO Emergencies Director Dr. Mike Ryan said the novel coronavirus will be hard to wipe out completely.

According to John Hopkins University's latest data, more than 4.4 million people worldwide have been infected and nearly 300,000 have died from COVID-19. And the end of the virus may not be in sight anytime soon, Ryan said.

""I think its important to put this on the table: this virus may become just another endemic virus in our communities, and this virus may never go away,"" Ryan said.

He brought up the fact that HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, is still around decades later, but therapies have allowed people with the virus to live ""long, healthy lives.""

""HIV has not gone away, but we have come to terms with the virus and we have found the therapies and we found the prevention methods and people don't feel as scared as they did before,"" he said. ""And we're offering life to people with HIV. Long, healthy lives to people with HIV. And I'm not comparing the two diseases, but I think it is important that we should be realistic. And I don't think anyone can predict when or if this disease will disappear.""

More than 100 potential coronavirus vaccines are in development, according to WHO. Ryan expressed optimism on ""eliminating this virus"" if a vaccine is developed and distributed throughout the world. ""That vaccine will have to be available, it'll have to be highly effective, it will have to be made available to everyone and we will have to use it,"" he said.

But Ryan pointed out that the existence of a vaccine does not guarantee global protection. He mentioned that before the pandemic struck, medical teams were working with young children in Samoa who were on ventilators: The children gotten sick with measles and were not vaccinated against it, even though a safe and effective vaccine has existed for decades.

""Forgive me if I am cynical but we have perfectly effective vaccines on this planet that we have not used effectively for diseases we could eliminate and eradicate — and we haven't done it,"" he said.

Even with a vaccine, Ryan said every single step in combating the virus has its challenges, but overcoming them will serve as a window into countries working together down the road.

""It's a massive opportunity for the world,"" he said. ""The idea that a new disease could emerge, cause a pandemic and we could with a massive moonshot find a vaccine and give that to everyone that needs it and stop this disease in its tracks will turn maybe what has been a tragic pandemic into a beacon of hope to the future of our planet in the way we care for our citizens.""",real

The old maxim certainly rings true when we consider the life-enhancing things which have disappeared since the Coronavirus lockdown, and whose return would do much to lift our morale.

The Grand National. The FA Cup. The weekend football programme. The climax to the Rugby Six Nations. Wimbledon. The World Snooker Championship. Euro 2020. The Olympic Games. Just some of the great sporting events we’ve missed - or will miss - since Covid-19 left its calling card - and the subsequent lockdowns took effect.

The reaction of most public figures was to say ‘Who cares. Sport doesn’t really matter’. Even those who profess to be sports fans have said we can easily do without it. Piers Morgan, the shy and retiring breakfast television presenter (and Arsenal supporter), has repeatedly opposed plans to complete the 2019/20 football season.

Not only has there been little public support from media ‘Talking Heads’ for sport to return, sporting events have even been blamed for the spread of Covid19. I wrote in a recent Sputnik column on how the Cheltenham National Hunt Racing Festival, which took place from 10-13th March, has been made the Covid-19 fall-guy by many people, even though there was no compelling evidence to back up the claims that holding it was injurious to public health.

There were hopes earlier this month that racing might return behind ‘closed doors’ on 15th May, but the government’s new ‘road map’ for easing the lockdown, published on Monday, put paid to that. Now the earliest we can hope for a return in the UK is early June, and even that must be in some doubt, when one reads the small print.

Two important points are missed by those who say the return of sport should be a very low priority in the current circumstances. Firstly, we’re talking about industries which directly or indirectly many thousands of people and contribute greatly to the economy. Horse-racing for instance brings in between £3.5bn and £4bn. But a lot of jobs in racing will go unless the sport gets back into action soon, with smaller trainers, and the smaller racecourses, facing a very uncertain future.

Secondly, there‘s the enormous positive impact that watching - and playing - sport can have in our daily lives.

Consider this: in a parallel universe this coming Sunday is the final day of the Premiership football season. Think of the excitement we would be enjoying - and all the thrills we‘ve missed these last seven weeks or so.

Without the drama of horse-racing and ´Final Score’, Saturday afternoons in the UK are simply not the same. Last week, the Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said that the return of sport would ‘lift the spirits of the nation’. For once, he was right - but guess what? He was shouted down.

""You’re an absolute T**T. We don’t need sport to lift the nation"", was one tweeter’s reaction. How well that tweeter would have fitted in in the days of Oliver Cromwell. During the kill-joy rule of the Puritans in the 1650s most sports were banned.

""Despite playing in his youth, the game's (football’s) 'frivolity' didn't fit into Oliver Cromwell's puritanical world"", reports the Guardian.

I’m sure ‘The Lord Protector’ would feel very much at home in the lockdown Britain of today - with its lack of sport, its closed theatres and pubs, and its shut-down places of public entertainment.

A country where even citizens in Warrington doing a socially-distanced conga for VE Day received fierce criticism from the 2020 equivalent of the New Model Army. It seems that having any kind of fun ( apart from clapping outside your front door once a week every Thursday evening), is not allowed in 'Lockdown Britain'.

© AFP 2020 / ISABEL INFANTES An image of Britain's Queen Elizabeth II making her her address to the UK and the Commonwealth in relation to the coronavirus epidemic is displayed on the advertising boards at Piccadilly Circus in central London on April 9, 2020, as Britain continues to battle the outbreak of Coronavirus Covid-19 and warm weather tests the nationwide lockdown as the long Easter weekend approaches. - The disease has struck at the heart of the British government, infected more than 60,000 people nationwide and killed over 7,000, with a daily death toll in England of 765 reported on April 9.

Of course we all need to ‘stay alert’ over Covid19- and take sensible precautions to avoid catching it or passing it on, but surely the existence of a virus doesn’t mean we shouldn’t have any enjoyment at all in our lives? What in fact is ‘saving life’ for, if we don’t enjoy it?

The return of sport would be a wonderful diversion from the depressing diet of ‘fear-porn’ news we are fed on a daily basis. How lovely it would be to once again become engrossed in issues of promotion and relegation. On focusing on who was going to win the 3.35 at Sandown Park, rather than what was going to be said at the daily Covid-19 Press briefings.

Those who dismiss sport as a ‘triviality’ fail to understand that something can be simultaneously both unimportant and important. To some the result of a horse race is of supreme unimportance. But to those who train or look after horses, who ride them, who bet on them, or who follow the form, it’s far more important than many other things. Ditto soccer. Keith Castle was Britain’s first successful heart transplant patient, back in 1979. His first words after regaining consciousness after his operation? ‘How did Fulham get on?’ He was a man who clearly had his priorities right, (if not his choice of football team).

I’d say the return of Saturday football, regular horse-racing, and other sports too, will do more to cheer the country up than any of the po-faced talking heads who oppose such moves. And goodness me, don’t we all need some cheering up at present.

In this interview with Spiro Skouras, you will most likely learn things you have never heard before about the COVID-19 pandemic. Dr. Kaufman will explain why this is all planned, and is not really about a dangerous virus at all, but a way to control people’s lives.

He will explain things about the new type of vaccine they are rushing so fast to develop, and what he believes is the real objective for this vaccine.

Dr. Kaufman has already paid a steep price to be a whistle blower, and he only expects it to get worse.

He states:

This is the only important thing for me to do now, is to get this information out, so that we can prevent ourselves from living in a horrible, horrible future.

I have two young children, and they are my main motivating factor, that I don’t want them to live in a world where they have no freedom. And that’s where we’re heading right now.

And so whatever risks there are, they’re risks that I simply have to take. That’s why I am doing what I am doing.

There have been things that have occurred. I have had consequences. I was let go from my regular psychiatry job because I refused to wear a mask.

I have had several friends who are doctors or other health care professionals who have been very upset with me. (They’re) disappointed and won’t talk to me anymore.

I knew that those risks were part of this. But that’s not what’s important.

I’ll tell you that I would be happy to risk being taken to jail as well, because I’m not going to participate in any of these measures.

I don’t wear a mask. I don’t stay at home.

I respect other people’s rights to make their own choices. So I don’t go and get in people’s faces.

But if anyone is willing to make eye contact and interact with me, I don’t observe any social distancing, (and so) any opportunity to hug someone, especially in public, I always take advantage of that, because I want to show people that actually all of these measures are really voluntary.

Even Governor Cuomo has made a public statement that there’s nothing that they can do to enforce any of these measures and that they are voluntary.

And I would like to encourage other people to make that decision, because if we rely on the authority to give us approval of how to exercise our freedom, they’re going to take more freedoms away, as they’ve been doing.

So while I respect people that to go and protest at the City Hall or State Capital, they are coming from the right point of view, they’re just asking the authority figures, the government, to give them permission, when they don’t need permission from the government.

They already have permission because they have inalienable rights.

It’s not really a decision for me. It’s just what I feel that I have to do to preserve the way of life that I want to live for me and my children.

693,https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-frances-strange-defeat/,2020-05-08,Coronavirus: France’s ‘strange defeat’,"Presidential reelection campaigns are generally referendums on the incumbent. A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump’s measures of success. But after a manic 3½ years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.

By far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. “I’m not going to play that game,” said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. “I think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they’re not uniform across states and across countries.”

But even beyond the death count, there’s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. “I’m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,” the official said.

Some Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn’t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn’t been able to focus on getting the response right.

Trump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. “So it is a war and I define victory when it’s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,” he said on May 1. “It can never be a total victory because too many people have died.”

When American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn’t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush’s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.

Others are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. “Allowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,” argued one Republican close to the president.

“The closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.” Sen. Lindsey Graham

But, he added, “If things don’t look like they’re bouncing back by September, I think that’s going to be a problem.”

The fear that Trump can’t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.

When asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump’s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the “economic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.”

A spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.

Others are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)",real

After starting the season in the NHL before getting sent to the Wolves in November, Pirri had earned his third Vegas recall in the last month and seemed to be back in the Golden Knights’ plans.

Then the pandemic stopped the season and Pirri’s latest shot in the NHL. But Pirri, 29, is keeping it all in perspective.

“I am aware of what’s going on,” said Pirri, who was sent back to the Wolves on March 14. “It was good to be back up, but at the same time it’s a game. It’s a sport, and wherever I am I get to play hockey for a living, and I feel very fortunate. Health and safety is everything, and it is what it is. I’m sure I’m not the only guy going through this, and to be kind of frustrated by it isn’t going to do me any good, or basically anyone else, because it’s just a matter of getting through this time and taking care of one another.”

Pirri has spread that message through All In Illinois, a state initiative stressing the importance of sheltering at home. Pirri recorded a television commercial for All In, lending his voice along with luminaries such as Hillary Clinton, Common and Chance the Rapper, and sports figures like Mike Singletary, Patrick Kane, David Ross, Jim Thome and Toni Kukoc. During the 56-second spot, Pirri says he’s really happy to live in a state that has taken the pandemic so seriously, talks about how many of life’s biggest moments took place in Illinois, and said “us non-essential workers need to stay home and do our part together.”

Pirri said he was asked through the Wolves to participate and hopes his voice could influence people to be safe and help stop the spread of the virus. After all, Pirri is going through this just like everyone else. He even had to tell his two-year-old son, Luca, that the park was closed.

“I saw Kaner did it, so if people are listening to him, that’s huge,” Pirri said. “The more people that can get behind this, the sooner we all can get through it, because the whole flatten-the-curve idea seems to be the only way we’re going to get back to our normal lives. I was asked to do it, and that’s an easy ask.”

If the curve is flattened, maybe the season can continue in some form. When the season was halted, Pirri indicated he thought the games would return and that a solution could be found somewhat quickly. But as more information came out, he came to the realization this wouldn’t be over quickly.

“At first I was thinking stay ready, and now [I’m] waiting it out like everyone else,” Pirri said. “Obviously, there’s only so many pushups and situps you can do, but that’s just kind of the way it is right now. It would be great to be playing hockey, but the world’s got to figure out a bigger issue right now.”",real

On Monday, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel unveiled a joint plan to boost EU recovery from the coronavirus crisis after weeks of discussions on how to deploy the billions of euros needed to end the economic shock and recession.

The plan promoted by France and Germany calls for the creation of a €500 billion recovery fund able to offer grants to the worst-affected countries and regions.

IFO Institute President (Leibniz Institute for Economic Research at the University of Munich) Clemens Fuest has supported the German-French initiative to help the EU and offered his views on the matter during an online press conference with the Association of Foreign Press in Germany (VAP).

Sputnik: What do you think of Macron and Merkel’s new plan to restore the EU through the European Commission? We can already see resistance to these plans. Austria, the Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden insist that the EU only issue repayable loans, not subsidies. How can you explain the changed position on the part of the federal government? The federal government also spoke out against the so-called corona bonds.

Mr Fuest: What has been agreed here doesn’t really concern corona bonds. Corona bonds were not a clear, clearly defined concept, while what has been proposed is a clear, feasible concept. I very much welcome it. I think it’s important that Germany and France have come forward with a common initiative, the two states that quite often have different positions regarding EU finances, the two states that are very important to promote issues. Of course, other countries are also important and should be involved in this matter.

If we compare this with corona bonds, the corona bonds initiative, in my view, was a domestic policy initiative of the countries that presented this plan. They publicly demanded something from other states, knowing that they would refuse. It originally was something non-working. And such a policy, in my opinion, is taking place in Europe for domestic political reasons and is not constructive at the European level.

I think that this initiative is constructive. A model has been agreed that can be implemented. The huge challenge that we are facing regarding this fund is to show that the costs that are coming up here have added value due to distribution at the European level.

This means that it’s necessary to show that if the EU spends this money, it will be more beneficial than if member states lend money and spend it themselves. They could do that too. Member states must guarantee these debts. And the EU has virtually no income of its own.

Therefore, it’s all based on member states guarantees. And it must be shown that this European fund, the money that is given out, is more useful, that this money is used on things that national expenses cannot provide.

There is considerable potential for the aforementioned European added value. For example, the added value may consist in the fact that all this will become insurance. That money will go to countries that have been hit hardest by the crisis. We have some ideas in this regard. But we still don’t know exactly how much states will be affected.

According to the IMF forecast, Germany has a negative growth of seven percent, and France has a negative growth of eight percent. In Italy, negative growth is nine percent. According to the IMF forecast, this means that these three states have been affected to a similar extent. We don’t know whether things will get to this; it’s still unclear who will get this insurance money and who will pay it.

If the whole thing is organized in such a way that those who are hardest hit, but who can insure themselves against this crisis, get something, it is creating added value. A nation-state cannot insure itself.

But it wouldn’t help if all member states were hit equally. An insurance community where everyone suffers the same doesn’t help. However, added value will appear if the crisis is asymmetrical.

In the end, solidarity is also added value. This means that there is interest on the part of all European states that no country will collapse economically or destabilize. And that could also be European value-added. But, nevertheless, it won’t be easy to try to really spend money better than national money. This will need to be well demonstrated. If it works, this is very good.

I think the initiative for this fund at the European level is so important because it is a political signal that the EU is alive, that the EU is acting in a crisis like this. That is a very important signal. A signal that the EU will still be there after the crisis is a signal to everyone. It’s vital for the EU that certain actions are being taken here and that we can count on success.

On Political Debate

I expect political debate in parliament, as well as in other European countries. They are also very important, namely regarding where the will money be used and how it be determined that added value appears. What does this mean for future debt policy in Europe?

We need to understand that Rubicon is crossed here. It is fundamental reform, extensive debt financing at the European level. This will raise the question of whether the whole thing will be a dam break, whether we’ll have a sharp rise in public debt because we have a new level at which we also incur government debt, namely the European level.

It’s a very serious question. The answer given in the German-French document is correct. It says that there will be a repayment plan for these debts. And member countries must pay for it.

There will be such a repayment plan that, I hope – that would be right – in the event of the next crisis, the state debt quota in Europe as a whole – national, regional and European – won’t be higher than before this crisis. It will be better if it is lower. All of these issues will be discussed.

Question from France: Is this initiative Merkel’s answer to Macron?

I don’t think this is Merkel’s response to Macron, because this is the response to the crisis. The German-French document says a lot about European health policy. It’s necessary to create response groups.

It would be great if we had them when the pandemic broke out. This fund is a unique thing, a unique debt mechanism. It remains to be seen whether it will remain unique. After a while, new requirements for further debts will appear.

And this will lead to contradictions. Critics both in France and in my country, of course, will say that this is a dam break. Today they borrow, and tomorrow someone will want to borrow again. I think this is one of the risks you are taking.

I personally think that having weighed everything, it’s right to take risks.

Question from France: Is this the best initiative?

You can put down lots of possibilities on a blank piece of paper. I think this is a very good initiative. But many questions remain open. The package’s effectiveness will depend on how long it lasts. We must remember that EU decisions need to be ratified.

This begs the question: should it be ratified? Could it be that we will have a long-term ratification process, and these funds will come when the crisis has long ended? One can only hope that everyone understands this; there is an urgency for everyone involved.

But these are all open questions. This concept should be specified.

The EU needs to show signs of life. The fund should be created and it should become successful because it’s very difficult to imagine that the EU won’t do anything in this crisis. Critics will need to be convinced by showing that added value is created for everyone.

Question from Ukraine: is €500 billion a lot?

€500 billion amounts to about three percent of the EU’s GDP, maybe a little more. This is the amount paid over several years. This means that this is not a giant fiscal package, but it is a lot of money, first of all, compared to the current EU budget, which is a little more than one percent of GDP per year. For three years, this would be a doubling of costs.

The money should go to European programmes and it will be spent as part of the EU budget. Compared to what we are doing in Europe today, what is the EU budget, this is a lot of money.

Compared to national budgets, this, of course, is not that much. But the concept that money needs to be spent correctly is more important than the amount. In the German-French initiative, I understand it this way: here we are talking about spending within the EU budget, not about loans to someone there.

Kennedy Jr. Calls for an Investigation,"For over twenty years Bill Gates and his Foundation, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) have been vaccinating foremost children by the millions in remote areas of poor countries, mostly Africa and Asia.

Most of their vaccination program had disastrous results, causing the very illness (polio, for example in India) and sterilizing young women (Kenya, with modified tetanus vaccines). Many of the children died. Many of the programs were carried out with the backing of the WHO and – yes – the UN Agency responsible for the Protection of Children, UNICEF.

Most of these vaccination campaigns were implemented without the informed-consent of the children, parents, guardians or teachers, nor with the informed-consent, or with forged consent, of the respective government authorities. In the aftermath, The Gates Foundation was sued by governments around the world, Kenya, India, the Philippines – and more.

Bill Gates has a strange image of himself. He sees himself as The Messiah who saves the world through vaccination – and through population reduction.

Around the time, when the 2010 Rockefeller Report was issued, with its even more infamous “Lock Step” Scenario, precisely the scenario of which we are living the beginning right now, Bill Gates talked on a TED show in California, “Innovating to Zero” about the use of energy.

He used this TED presentation to promote his vaccination programs, literally saying, “If we are doing a real good job vaccinating childen, we can reduce the world population by 10% to 15%”.

This sounds very much like eugenics.

I have included the top comments as well:

The video, the first 6’45”, “The Truth about Bill Gates and his Disastrous Vaccination Program”, will tell you all about it.

Robert F Kennedy Jr, an avid Defender of Children’s Rights and anti-vaccination activist, has launched a petition sent to the White House, calling for “Investigations into the ‘Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation’ for Medical Malpractice & Crimes Against Humanity.”

Robert. F. Kennedy Exposes Bill Gates’ Vaccination Agenda

Now Mr. Gates and his allies, including Big-Pharma, WHO, UNICEF, Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of NIAID / NIH, a close ally of Mr. Gates – and of course, Agenda ID2020, are proposing to (force) vaccinate 7 billion people around the globe, with their concoction of a (so far) untested coronavirus vaccine.

This is a multi-billion dollar bonanza for Big Pharma and for all those who support the vaccine. Nobody will really know what the vaccine cocktail will contain. They intend to start with the Global South (Developing Countries) and then gradually move North (Developed Countries).

Mind you, there is no need for a vaccine to cure the corona virus. There are many cures:

French Professor Didier Raoult, who is one of the world’s top 5 scientists on communicable diseases, suggested the use of hydroxychloroquine (Chloroquine or Plaquenil), a well-known, simple, and inexpensive drug, also used to fight Malaria, and that has shown efficacy with previous coronaviruses such as SARS.

By mid-February 2020, clinical trials at his institute and in China already confirmed that the drug could reduce the viral load and bring spectacular improvement. Chinese scientists published their first trials on more than 100 patients and announced that the Chinese National Health Commission would recommend Chloroquine in their new guidelines to treat Covid-19.

Special to USA TODAY

The coronavirus pandemic has upended the personal finances of millions of workers and their loved ones. And one recent trend is of particular concern.

Many workers who have been furloughed or laid off are now strapped for cash. And they're considering borrowing money from their 401(k) instead of using other sources of funds.

Advisers recommend tapping all other sources of money before borrowing from your 401(k).

“Please stay away from retirement accounts,” says Chris Chen, a certified financial planner with Insight Financial Strategists. “The long-term damage is absolutely horrible.”

The economic crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic, which is closing businesses and forcing millions out of work, makes it even less appealing.

“We like to use 401(k) loans as a last resort, especially in a challenging financial environment,” says Dan Galli, a certified financial planner with Daniel J. Galli & Associates.

No match:My company just stopped their 401(k) match. What should I do?

Wall St. vs. Main St.:Here's why the market is better than the economy right now

Reason to avoid 401(k) loans

Galli also advises against 401(k) loans for this reason:

Plan sponsors, according to the IRS, may require an employee to repay the full outstanding balance of a loan if he or she terminates employment or if the plan is terminated. And that could put even more financial stress on your finances if you’re already desperate for living expenses.

Even worse: If you, the employee, are unable to repay the loan, then your employer will treat it as a distribution and report it to the IRS.

“The country is littered with stories about folks that took 401(k) withdrawals with every attempt to pay the money back, but never got around to it,” says Charles Sachs, a certified financial planner with Kaufman Rossin Wealth. “Imagine the lost growth over a 20-, 30- or 40-year period. If people think they have it tough now, they should imagine when they are in their 80s without the benefit of a nice sized 401(k).”

One bit of good news: You, the employee, can avoid the immediate income tax consequences by rolling over all or part of the loan’s outstanding balance to an IRA or eligible retirement plan by the due date for filing the Federal income tax return for the year in which the loan is treated as a distribution.

What to tap instead

So, where might you find money for living expenses? Well, for starters consider that each option has its pros and cons.

But in the main, borrowing from family, a home equity line of credit and credit cards should be used before borrowing from a 401(k), says Galli.

Thomas Scanlon, a certified financial planner with Raymond James, also recommends tapping your Roth IRA. “Your contributions to the Roth IRA can be withdrawn any time, income tax and penalty free,” he says. “This is because the contributions go in after tax.”

If you’re owed a refund, file your 2019 tax return right away. That’s another source of cash, says Rita Cheng, a certified financial planner Blue Ocean Global Wealth. Likewise, follow up on your stimulus check if you haven’t received that yet.

And, for some, accessing the cash value in your life insurance is another source of funds, says Cheng.

You might be able to take a hardship distribution from your 401(k) plan. Typically, it’s allowed for an immediate and heavy financial need, and limited to the amount necessary to satisfy that financial need. But experts generally advise against this tactic. That's because because you will have to pay taxes on the distribution, and you can’t pay the distribution back into your 401(k).

Bottom line: List all your available options and create a plan that will best position you to weather a difficult storm, says David Mullins, a certified financial planner with David Mullins Wealth Management Group.

When a 401(k) loan is the best option

To be fair, a 401(k) loan may be the best option, depending on the expected need and the length of time, and what other options are available. But remember “you are pulling from funds in a down market and missing out on a potential recovery,"" says David Shotwell, a certified financial planner Shotwell Rutter Baer. ""It may be less interest cost, but the long-term cost can be much greater.”

The right way and the wrong way: If you borrow money from your 401(k) plan, there are best practices to follow. When you take a loan, you are selling securities, says Leon LaBrecque, a certified financial planner with Sequoia Financial Advisors. And given that, Robert Braglia, a certified financial planner with American Financial & Tax Strategies, advises against taking the money on a pro-rata basis across all investment options but rather specify which ones, probably cash or bonds, will be sold.

The Cares Act: According to Ed Slott, a CPA with Ed Slott and Company, the CARES Act increases the maximum loan amount for qualified individuals to the lesser of $100,000 (reduced by other outstanding loans) or 100% of the account balance, and, two, allows qualified individuals to take up to $100,000 of penalty-free coronavirus-related IRA and company plan distributions during 2020. If you’re a qualified individual, either the loan or distribution could be a source of funds for living expenses.

“He has risked the health, safety and welfare of everyone who lives in this state, and I will not remain silent and just twiddle my thumbs as I see him do that,” Nessel said Friday on NPR’s “All Things Considered.”

Nessel went on to brand Michigan Trump supporters as Nazis when it was widely reported that protest signs with swastikas were in reference to Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s draconian lockdown policies.



“This is an individual who has encouraged people to break the law in a manner that jeopardizes the health of all our state residents,” Nessel said. “And then when we have armed gunmen storming the capitol holding swastikas and confederate flags, he calls them very good people who our governor ought to negotiate with.”

Nessel had threatened Thursday that Trump would not be allowed back in Michigan if he didn’t wear a mask during his time there, then went ballistic after he refused.

“He is a ridiculous person, and I am ashamed to have him be president of the United States of America,” she said. “I hope that the voters of Michigan will remember this when November comes. That he didn’t care enough about their safety, he didn’t care about their welfare, he didn’t respect them enough just to engage in the very simple task, the painless task, the easy task of wearing a mask when he was provided one.”

Trump fired back at the “whacky” partisan AG on Twitter Thursday, noting he did put on a mask during some of the Ford plant inspection.

“The Wacky Do Nothing Attorney General of Michigan, Dana Nessel, is viciously threatening Ford Motor Company for the fact that I inspected a Ventilator plant without a mask,” Trump tweeted. “Not their fault, & I did put on a mask. No wonder many auto companies left Michigan, until I came along!”

“Do nothing A.G. of the Great State of Michigan, Dana Nessel, should not be taking her anger and stupidity out on Ford Motor — they might get upset with you and leave the state, like so many other companies have — until I came along and brought business back to Michigan. JOBS!” he added.

Notably, Trump is probably one of the only people who is tested for coronavirus on a daily basis and is one of the most closely monitored individuals on Earth, so his chances of “risking the health” of Michiganders by not wearing a mask is practically zero.

201,https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201651/tesla-fremont-factory-covid-19-coronavirus-shutdown-shelter-in-place,2020-03-31,"Tesla created a ‘public health risk’ by keeping car factory open, local official said","Tesla announced on March 19th that it would temporarily shut down its electric car factory in California, after back-and-forth with local officials about whether the plant was subject to a county-wide coronavirus shelter-in-place order. But the Silicon Valley automaker fought to keep the factory open after that announcement as well, according to new emails obtained by Protocol. It also came after the county’s health officer decided that keeping the plant open was a “public health risk.”

The emails were sent by the local police chief to Tesla’s senior policy advisor, Dan Chia. Each one includes a letter memorializing calls and virtual meetings between Tesla and local city and county officials. They help shed light on the deliberations between the company and the authorities about whether the factory was an “essential business,” which would have allowed it to stay open following the county-wide (and eventually state-wide) shelter-in-place orders meant to help combat the spread of the novel coronavirus.

Tesla’s argument to those local officials, and to its own workers, has been that the company believes it should be considered “national critical infrastructure,” according to public guidelines from the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA. CISA issued guidelines outlining what it considered to be critical infrastructure in 2015 that included “vehicles and commercial ships manufacturing.” But in a March 28th memorandum about the novel coronavirus pandemic, vehicle manufacturing is not specifically listed in the “critical manufacturing” section of CISA’s guidance. At the same time that Tesla was making this argument, every other major automaker ceased manufacturing operations in the US.

Tesla wanted to stay open because it believed it was “national critical infrastructure”

Tesla tried to convince city and county officials of this in the days leading up to the shutdown announcement, and asked to be deemed an “essential business” so it could keep producing the Model 3, Model S, Model X, and the Model Y (which the company had just started delivering) at the California factory.

Kimberly Petersen, the chief of police in Fremont, California (where the factory is located), told Chia on March 18th that the county’s interim health officer had decided Tesla’s factory was not essential, according to the emails, meaning it would have to abide by the March 16th shelter-in-place order and stop operations. The county health officer also told the city that keeping the manufacturing plant open and making the 10,000 or so workers report in would be a “public health risk,” though it’s unclear in the emails if this was specifically communicated to Tesla. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The next day, Chia and a number of other Tesla executives told the city in a virtual meeting that the company would comply with the order. “I would like to reiterate that the City of Fremont highly values Tesla as a partner and appreciates what you do for our economy and our community,” Petersen wrote in her email memorializing the meeting, which was dated March 21st. “We are extremely grateful for your willingness to collaborate in our fight against the spread of COVID-19 by placing public health ahead of all other priorities.”

Later that day, though, Chia told the deputy city manager that he felt Petersen’s letter was “not fully accurate,” and the two sides had another virtual meeting on March 22nd. During that meeting, Tesla’s acting general counsel told the city that he believed the state-wide shelter-in-place order issued by Gov. Gavin Newsom superseded the county order, and that the language of the state order left room for Tesla to remain open. In another memo sent to Tesla on March 22nd, Petersen writes that she nonetheless felt “bound to uphold [the county health officer’s] interpretation” of the county-wide order.

Tesla ultimately decided to keep winding down its operations at the factory, save for basic operations like payroll. It also told the city that it would keep bringing in some factory workers to perform so-called “end-of-line” work, and the Fremont police department found Tesla to be “in compliance” during a post-shutdown inspection, as was first reported by The Verge last week.

The company has since gone on to scale back operations at the Gigafactory in Nevada by more than 75 percent, and has also shut down its solar panel factory in New York. Curiously, Petersen told Tesla in one of the emails that if the company “transition[ed] to manufacturing ventilators, or other equipment intended to aid in the fight against COVID-19,” it could have kept the factory open. Tesla is currently sourcing and delivering desperately needed ventilators in California and New York, along with surgical masks, and CEO Elon Musk has said he wants to manufacture ventilators with help from Medtronic. But Musk has said he plans to make the ventilators at Tesla’s New York factory, not in California.",real
1445,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/05/19/trump-pelosi-hydroxychloroquine-coronavirus/,2020-05-19,"Trump’s use of unproven drug to ward off covid-19 prompts concerns, ridicule. It’s not for the ‘morbidly obese,’ says Pelosi.","But those dire warnings appear to have done little to change the president’s opinion. On Monday, toward the end of a roundtable event with restaurant industry executives at the White House, Trump offered his strongest endorsement of the drug to date.



“I’m taking it — hydroxychloroquine,” Trump said. “Right now.”

He later told reporters: “I was just waiting to see your eyes light up when I said this … you know, when I announced this. But, yeah, I have taken it for about a week and a half now, and I’m still here. I’m still here.”



Trump’s announcement that he has been taking the drug in combination with zinc for about 10 days as a preventive measure against the novel virus prompted numerous questions, reactions and concerns, including an unflattering suggestion from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) that the president shouldn’t be using the medicine because he is “morbidly obese.”

“He’s our president, and I would rather he not be taking something that has not been approved by the scientists,” Pelosi said on CNN in a now-viral clip, “especially in his age group, and in his, shall we say, weight group: ‘Morbidly obese,’ they say.”



“I would rather he not be taking something that has not been approved by the scientists, especially in his age group, and in his, shall we say, weight group: ‘Morbidly obese,’ they say,” says House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Pres. Trump’s revelation he is taking hydroxychloroquine. pic.twitter.com/0ImjpEjg9q — Anderson Cooper 360° (@AC360) May 19, 2020

It all began Monday with a question about whistleblowers, which prompted Trump to launch into a lengthy tirade that started with Ukraine and impeachment before turning to the most recent whistleblower to draw his anger: former top vaccine official Rick Bright.



“See whether or not he was a big contributor to the Democrats. See whether or not he wanted the Democrats to win,” Trump told reporters, referring to Bright. “There’s a lot of bad things coming out about him, but you people don’t want to write the news.”

Trump appeared to be angered by Bright’s comments from a “60 Minutes” segment that aired Sunday. In the interview, Bright, who claims he was retaliated against last month for raising concerns about hydroxychloroquine, continued his criticism of the federal government’s handling of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, calling the response slow and chaotic.



On Monday, Trump pointed out it was Bright who had signed a request to the Food and Drug Administration to issue an emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine to treat covid-19.

“Now, if he doesn’t believe in it, why would he sign it?” Trump said, before abruptly pivoting to his startling revelation.



“A lot of good things have come out about the hydroxy. A lot of good things have come out,” Trump continued. “You’d be surprised at how many people are taking it, especially the front-line workers, before you catch it. The front-line workers, many, many are taking it.”

Then, the president revealed front-line workers are not the only group of people taking the drug to protect against the virus. He is, too.



Following a brief pause as reporters digested the news, multiple voices rang out all at once with the same follow-up question: “You’re taking hydroxychloroquine?”

Trump’s claim unleashed a torrent of queries from the journalists in the room — and number of the same questions were repeatedly raised throughout the night as politicians, medical professionals and the general public were left puzzled over the president’s decision.



Chief among the questions that emerged Monday was “why?” Why would the president start taking a drug that experts say has no proven ability to protect against covid-19 and also has potentially deadly side effects?

“Because I think it’s good,” Trump said.



Up against the weight of scientific opinion, he offered “a lot of good stories” that he has heard about it. “And if it’s not good, I’ll tell you. … I’m not going to get hurt by it. It’s been around for 40 years for malaria, for lupus, for other things.”

Trump again claimed front-line workers and “a lot of doctors” take hydroxychloroquine, but he provided no details. He also repeatedly cited letters and calls he said he has received from people heralding the drug’s effects, often referring to one note from an unnamed doctor near Westchester, N.Y.



“He just said, ‘Sir, I have hundreds of patients and I give them hydroxychloroquine; I give them the Z-Pak, which is azithromycin; and I give them zinc,’ ” Trump said, appearing to quote the letter from memory. “ ‘And out of the hundreds of patients — many hundreds, over 300 patients — I haven’t lost one.’ ”



The reporters, however, kept pressing.

“Did the White House doctor recommend that you take that? Is that why you’re taking it?” one asked.

“No, I asked him, ‘What do you think?’ ” Trump said, recalling the conversation with the White House physician. “He said, ‘Well, if you’d like it.’ I said, ‘Yeah, I’d like it. I’d like to take it.’ ”

Later Monday, the White House released a letter from Sean P. Conley, Trump’s in-house physician, that confirmed he had spoken with the president about the drug.



“After numerous discussions he and I had for and against the use of hydroxychloroquine, we concluded the potential benefit from treatment outweighed the relative risks,” Conley wrote.



But the letter did not specify whether Conley had written Trump a prescription for hydroxychloroquine or if the president is actually taking “a pill every day,” as he said during Monday’s event.

“I’m taking the two: the zinc and the hydroxy,” Trump said. “And all I can tell you is, so far, I seem to be okay.”

One reporter went on to inquire about another possibility for Trump’s decision to start the regimen, given recent news that at least two people in the White House, including a personal valet to the president, have tested positive for coronavirus.

“Have you been exposed?” the reporter asked.

“No, not at all,” Trump responded, later stressing he has “zero symptoms” and has consistently negative test results.





As Trump continued touting the drug, it didn’t take long for someone to ask, “What is the evidence that it has a preventive effect?”

“Here we go, you ready? Here’s my evidence,” the president said, spreading his hands wide. “I get a lot of positive calls about it.”

Trump noted that the “only negative” feedback he has heard about the drug comes from an analysis done by academic researchers that examined the medical records of 368 male patients at Veterans Affairs hospitals nationwide and found the drug was linked to higher rates of death for those hospitalized with the coronavirus. According to the April study, more than 27 percent of patients who received hydroxychloroquine died, and 22 percent of patients who were treated with a combination of the drug and the antibiotic azithromycin also died. In comparison, the death rate for those who did not receive the drugs was 11.4 percent.



“The only negative I’ve heard was the study where they gave it — was it the VA? With, you know, people that aren’t big Trump fans gave it,” Trump said, adding, “It was a very unscientific report, by the way. But I get a lot of tremendously positive news on the hydroxy. And I say, ‘Hey.’ You know the expression I’ve used …? ‘What do you have to lose?’ Okay? ‘What do you have to lose?’ ”

Medical experts quickly rejected Trump’s dismissal of safety concerns.

“There is NO evidence for [hydroxychloroquine] being effective in treatment of #covid19 or prophylaxis to prevent the disease,” tweeted Leana S. Wen, former Baltimore city health commissioner and a contributing columnist to The Washington Post. “This is a medication that has serious side effects.”

There is NO evidence for hydrochloroquine being effective in treatment of #covid19 or prophylaxis to prevent the disease. This is a medication that has serious side effects.

In an appearance on CNN, Sanjay Gupta, the network’s chief medical correspondent, said Trump “shouldn’t be taking” the drug.

“His own FDA has said that this is still something under investigation that should not be taken outside of a clinical trial,” Gupta said. “Only hospitalized patients should be getting it.”

While Gupta acknowledged Trump was right in saying the drug has been used to prevent malaria for decades, its use in people who already have coronavirus poses “some real concerns.”

Aside from the medical community, Trump’s comments also struck a nerve with a number of cable news personalities, most notably Fox News’s Neil Cavuto.

“If you are in a risky population here and you are taking this as a preventive treatment to ward off the virus, or in a worst-case scenario, you are dealing with the virus and you are in this vulnerable population, it will kill you,” Cavuto said during his Monday show. “I cannot stress enough: This will kill you.”

“Whatever benefits the president says this has, and certainly it has had for those suffering from malaria, dealing with lupus, this is a leap that should not be taken casually by those watching at home or assuming, well, the president of the United States says it’s okay,” Cavuto added. “Not to make a political point here, but a life and death point. Be very, very careful.”",real

The move is the latest large-event casualty of the coronavirus pandemic, joining the cancellation of Chicago’s blues and gospel festivals, announced last week.

“There just is no way that we could make this [happen],” said Ravinia president and CEO Welz Kauffman about Friday’s announcement. “We’ve been wracking our brains trying to figure out how to make the social distancing work and ensure the safety of everyone who comes here — the kids and families, the artists, staff and our neighbors. There was just no way to do it. ... And many artists have already canceled their 2020 tours.”

The season shut-down is the first one since the Great Depression forced the now 116-year-old festival to close its doors from 1932 to 1935.

Ravinia’s 60 full-time staff are being redeployed from their usual duties to handling the cancellation, upcoming developments and next year’s festival plans. “We decided that furloughing was not the way to go,” Kauffman said. Nearly 600 seasonal workers needed each year for the festival will not be hired.

Kauffman said the cancellation was a unanimous and heartbreaking decision by the festivals’ board of directors.

“How was anyone even going to get here?,” Kauffman said. “Nobody’s going to get on a Metra train and then stand in lines to get bags checked and tickets taken one at a time.” Nearly 60,000 people ride Metra to the festival’s front gate each year. Overall, more than 500,000 people attend the festival annually.

This season’s lineup was announced March 12 for shows June 12-Sept. 16. Jill Scott, Patti LaBelle, Ms. Lauryn Hill, Tony Bennett, John Legend and Rodrigo y Gabriela were among the acts that had been booked, in addition to a full summer residency by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under the baton of the festival’s newly appointed chief conductor and curator Marin Alsop.

In addition, Ravinia’s famed Steans Music Institute, the summerlong teaching/performance conservatory for young artists, is also shuttered for the year. Plans for online music and educational programming are in the robust discussion stages, Kauffman said.

2020 also marks Kauffman’s final season at the helm of the festival after 20 years, and though he would not comment about his departure, he offered enthusiastic support for the 2021 season.

“I’m just going to continue to work through the particular aspects of the 2020 [season] and then the focus will shift to 2021,” Kauffman said. “I hope I’m able to leave my successor or successors something they can feel good about, and that does mean keeping as much in place from this summer for next summer. We just don’t know yet. In many ways it’s easier to just move someone from one year to another than it is to start fresh. And this season is one we and our audiences were very excited about.”

To date, Kauffman said at least a dozen artists have already requested rescheduled dates for 2021, though he would not elaborate. “We’re still working through all of this.”

Ticketholders can get refunds or vouchers for future performances by calling the box office at (847) 266-5100. Donors are being contacted directly. Patrons can also consider donating their tickets back to Ravinia to help fund outreach programs.

NOTE: WTTW-Channel 11 will broadcast the 2018 Ravinia production of Leonard Bernstein’s “Mass” featuring the Chicago Symphony Orchestra conducted by Marin Alsop and starring Tony Award-winner Paulo Szot as The Celebrant, at 9 p.m May 15 as part of the PBS “Great Performances” series.",real
1448,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/05/19/new-political-battleground-over-coronavirus-math/,2020-05-19,The new political battleground over the coronavirus? Math.,"The graph became so ubiquitous that even President Trump at one point stood beside an iteration of it as his team advocated for broad social distancing efforts.

As the virus has continued to spread, experts and more casual observers have tracked daily numbers to evaluate the progress being made. Seeing a gap in data on daily testing, a group of volunteers established a project to compile individual state reports. Dashboards like the one created by researchers from Johns Hopkins University became go-to destinations for information about the virus’s spread. More sophisticated users tracked the reproduction number for the virus by state, a measure of its effective contagiousness. And when the Trump administration decided to encourage a scaling back of the containment measures, which had left a number of businesses closed, it established numeric benchmarks that states were supposed to meet before doing so.





When numbers and politics overlap, though, tension often emerges. If facts are stubborn things, numbers are nearly immobile — but not irreplaceable. In recent weeks, we have seen a number of occasions when the numbers related to the coronavirus pandemic have been misrepresented, altered or made a focus of efforts at reinterpretation as the inertia of political motivation has pushed against mathematical reality.

On Monday evening, Florida Today reported that the head of the Florida Department of Health’s data team claimed to have been forced from her position earlier this month. Rebekah Jones helped create a localized dashboard of coronavirus information used to track the spread of the virus in the state. A few weeks ago, though, control over the information was taken away from the department.

In a farewell note, Jones offered a word of caution about the data still being presented on the site.





“I would not expect the new team to continue the same level of accessibility and transparency that I made central to the process during the first two months,” Jones wrote. “After all, my commitment to both is largely (arguably entirely) the reason I am no longer managing it.”

Once the White House gave the green light for states to scale back distancing measures at the end of April, Florida quickly moved forward with doing so. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), a strong Trump ally, announced that the state would begin to reopen on May 4 — one day before Jones was removed from her position. The state did not reply to questions from Florida Today about the change in management of the data.

In Georgia, a different data-based kerfuffle emerged late last week. The state, which moved even more rapidly than Florida to scale back social distancing measures, has been a subject of scrutiny about whether it moved too quickly. So far, neither Georgia nor Florida has seen a significant increase in new infections — but things have not gone quite as well as one graph from the state’s Department of Public Health made it seem.





Political reporter Stephen Fowler noticed an anomaly in the graph showing a consistent downward trend in new cases in several large counties. That trend was a function of the data being shown out of order — May 1 was followed by April 30, which was followed by May 6, for example. The state claimed it had made a mistake, seeking to show data in a more readable way, without success. As Fowler noted, this wasn’t the primary graph detailing the spread of the virus on the site, bolstering the idea that it was simply a mistake, albeit a mistake that, at first glance, bolstered Republican Gov. Brian Kemp’s decision to reopen Georgia.

As the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported, though, this was only one of a number of data mistakes or changes made by the state government. To some extent, this is a natural function of the fluid, shifting pandemic. It nonetheless raises questions about the validity of the numbers being used to evaluate Georgia’s progress and introduces the possibility of outside influence.

Trump and his allies are certainly aware of the focus on the numbers undergirding the pandemic. The president has consistently focused on the number of new cases of coronavirus and the death toll from covid-19, the disease it causes, as measures of his administration’s success. At times, he has been explicit about his efforts to keep the numbers from being inflated, as when he said at the beginning of March that he preferred to keep passengers on a ship anchored near San Francisco to prevent the number of cases in the United States from spiking.





Earlier this month, Axios reported on a different effort by the administration to tweak the numbers. Worried about a continually increasing death toll from the virus, Trump — echoing voices on Fox News and in the conservative media — argued that the totals were being overcounted. In reality, the death toll is almost certainly being significantly undercounted, but that is far less politically useful to a president seeking reelection in November.

Again, there is a natural uncertainty to a number of these metrics, offering cover to efforts to shape what they say. In Nebraska, counts of new infections at meatpacking plants were climbing quickly — until the state stopped reporting the numbers. Gov. Pete Ricketts (R) argued that some of those who had been infected were misreporting their places of employment, making the numbers seem worse than they were. Public pressure eventually helped prompt the companies to release information about new infections.

Nationally, the data show that the number of new cases each day and the number of deaths from covid-19 have each declined. That’s obviously good news and bolsters the idea that the nation can cautiously begin relaxing some containment efforts. The question that arises, however, is whether states and the federal government will respond if those cases begin to rapidly increase again. Will there be a new push for social distancing rules?

The country's government confirmed in a statement on Friday that its Covid-19 epidemic had ended, after Slovenia's National Institute of Public Health concluded ""all indicators point to a slowdown in the spread of the virus in the population.""

According to data from Slovenia's Ministry of Health, just one new case of the coronavirus was confirmed on Thursday, with no deaths reported. Over the past two weeks, just 35 people had been infected with the coronavirus, according to the health authority, while the reproductive number for the virus — known as the R rating or R0 — was below 1.

An R below 1 means each infected individual will on average transmit the virus to less than one other person.

On Thursday, Prime Minister Janez Jansa told parliament that the Balkan country ""has the best epidemiological picture in Europe.""

Despite declaring an end to the epidemic, the government said it would keep measures such as widescale testing, contact tracing and bans on public gatherings in place pending a review on May 31. It will also remain mandatory to wear face coverings in public spaces until at least the end of the month.",real

He was 52.

Sneed’s publicist Bill Carpenter said the singer died early Monday at a hospital in Jacksonville, Florida. Sneed earned a Grammy nomination for his work on the Youth For Christ’s 1999 album “Higher.”

Sneed traveled throughout the United States early in his career to sing the gospel with the Georgia Mass Choir. He arranged music on their albums and appeared with the choir in the 1996 film “The Preacher’s Wife,” starring Whitney Houston and Denzel Washington.

Sneed helped form Youth For Christ, which was comprised of members between the ages of 12 and 18 from the Georgia Mass Choir. He served as a producer on Youth For Christ’s “The Struggle Is Over,” which landed at No. 1 on Billboard’s gospel songs chart in 2006.

As a solo artist, Sneed released seven albums and had several hit songs within the gospel realm including “Work It Out” and “My Heart Says Yes,” which both peaked at No. 2 on Billboard’s gospel chart. He’s also known for the upbeat “Hallelujah.”

Sneed and his wife, Emily, started their own record label Emtro, which is a blend of their first names. Their label became a success with a roster of artists from Alvin Darling & Celebration and Rev. Rudolph McKissick.",real

“We are grateful to the frontline responders who are risking their well-being to protect Chicago neighborhoods,” said Citadel Securities CEO Peng Zhao, who organized the donation with his wife Cherry Chen.

The effort follows months of President Donald Trump blaming China for the pandemic.

On Monday, when a Chinese American reporter asked the president why he sees testing for the coronavirus as a “global competition,” he responded, “Maybe that’s a question you should ask China.” On Tuesday, Trump tweeted: “Asian Americans are VERY angry at what China has done to our Country, and the World. Chinese Americans are the most angry of all.”

Zhao and more than a dozen other Chinese American business leaders bought the masks and asked the University of Chicago Crime Lab to help distribute them.

About 750,000 of the masks are going to the Chicago Department of Public Health, which will provide them to Chicago police officers and other city workers who need them, according to the crime lab. More than 500 officers have tested positive for COVID-19, and three have died.

About 100,000 masks will go to the Chicago Public Schools. Masks also are being given to nonprofits that work with at-risk youth.

The distribution of the masks began May 4.

Roseanna Ander, executive director of the crime lab, said the donation comes at a time China is under fire by Trump and others and said, “We all have a common enemy in COVID-19 and a shared interest in stopping its spread, protecting our brave frontline responders and ultimately finding a vaccine.”

Ken Griffin, founder of Citadel and Chicago’s richest man, is paying for cleaning supplies and medical equipment for cops and other first-responders. He also donated $2.5 million to feed Chicago schoolchildren during the pandemic. In early February, he and his companies contributed $7.5 million to help China’s Hubei province, where the pandemic began.",real

Despite only boasting what could be describing as an average record in the Ultimate Fighting Championship, the 26-year-old VanZant has become one of the faces of the female fight game.

Her profile has grown considerably in recent years owing to being featured on the US version of 'Dancing With The Stars', as well as stripping off for the annual Sports Illustrated swimsuit edition.

However, VanZant has apparently being increasingly of the opinion that her UFC pay-packet doesn't quite match her profile outside of the Octagon and appears keen to demonstrate her value to the organization ahead of an upcoming showdown with the 9-1 Brazilian Amanda Ribas.

It was reported by ESPN that VanZant will take on the surging Ribas on July 11. A location hasn't been officially confirmed, though a post on VanZant's Instagram stated that she will be ""coming to an island near you,"" in an apparent reference to Dana White's novel 'Fight Island' concept.

The UFC president has remained steadfastly tight-lipped as to the specifics of 'Fight Island', but it is thought that the idea will become a reality this summer and is designed as a method to have fighters based within the United States compete against athletes from outside the country as a means to bypass travel restrictions into the country amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

Injury has kept VanZant out of the cage since a January 2019 win against Rachael Ostovich. She was scheduled to fight Ribas in March before being forced to withdraw with an arm injury, with the Brazilian fighting and defeating Rando Markos in VanZant's place.

The fight will represent that final bout on VanZant's UFC contract, after which she has suggested she will test the free agency market where it is likely she will receive interest from other MMA leagues. However, VanZant's growing reputation - coupled with an impressive performance against Ribas - could force the UFC's hand in handing her an improved deal.

""I want to prove my worth,"" VanZant said last month. ""You truly can’t find what your value is until you’re a free agent. When you’re locked into a contract, the only people that can set your value are the people that you’re signed with.""

""Change is very hard, but I’m looking for the best opportunity for my future and I don’t know what that is,"" she explained.

""I think it’s going to take negotiation with the UFC and negotiations with other organizations to know who’s going to offer me the brighter future. It might come down to other factors outside just a dollar figure. It’s really about who’s going to propel me to the best of their ability.""

VanZant garnered significant attention online in recent months by posting a series of semi-nude photographs alongside her husband, Bellator welterweight prospect Austin Vanderford - and has admitted that the money she receives from Instagram endorsements outstrips that of her UFC deal.

""If I were to stop everything I do outside of fighting and just fight, I would be at a loss. By a long shot,"" VanZant said in 2019.

And it seems likely that if Dana White is unwilling to cut the star an improved check, there is a realistic scenario where VanZant lines up alongside her husband as the latest UFC refugee to move to Bellator in pursuit of a sturdier salary.",fake
844,https://blog.heartland.org/2020/05/the-coronavirus-and-the-attack-on-liberty-and-privacy/,2020-05-13,The Coronavirus and the Attack on Liberty and Privacy,"The coronavirus crisis has, once more, reminded us all of how much we live in an interdependent world in which what happens in one part of the globe has serious impacts in many other places, and how each of our own actions potentially have implications and importance for the well-being of multitudes of others around us, both near and far. The question is, what societal arrangement is most likely to effectively and successfully assure cooperative coordination of all that we are doing?

Dr. Diane Coyle, professor of economics at Cambridge University in the United Kingdom, believes that the coronavirus pandemic demonstrates the need for greater politically organized collective action, both in the current crisis and looking ahead. She argues in, “Covid-19 and the End of Individualism,” that the market economy has met its match, and political paternalism in the forms of regulation and control is needed in its place, more than ever.

However, some of us would reply that it is precisely because of our mutual interconnectedness in a global division of labor and exactly because each of our individual actions have influences on the well-being of others that we need to utilize a system of open, competitive markets even more than before to overcome the personal and societal effects from the coronavirus.

Social Interdependency and Government Big Data Collection

The dramatic decline in overall production around the world, along with the accompanying massive rise in unemployment almost everywhere shows, Dr. Coyle says, that Adam Smith was right that the division of labor has the capacity of making all participants better off. But the interdependency of specialization highlights that “what affects some parts substantially affects the whole. This web of linkages is therefore a vulnerability when disrupted.”

Modern technologies have intensified the possibilities of spillover effects, she says, because of the “sophisticated logistical networks and just-in-time supply chains. The very nature of the digital economy means that each of our individual choices will affect many other people.”

The new age of potential “big data” collection and the need to make it as comprehensive as possible to enable “global” and collective policy decisions by governments means that individual privacy must be given a lower priority so those in political authority can know enough about the nature, transmissions, and impacts of the coronavirus to design and implement effective government responses to the epidemic, including the planning of any moving out of the politically imposed lockdowns.

Dr. Coyle states, “This approach will be effective only if a high enough proportion of the population uses the same app and shares the data it gathers . . . No app will be effective if people are unwilling to provide ‘their’ data to governments rolling out the system. If I decide to withhold information about my movements and contacts, this would adversely affect everyone . . . In the current circumstances, the collective goal outweighs individual preferences.”

Rationalizing the Need for Government to Know Everything

The implication is fairly clear: Everyone in the country (in the world!) must be required to download government-chosen apps on their respective mobile devices; they must allow the apps to collect whatever personal information is considered essential for tracking the movements and activities of the individuals in question; and permit his and her data to be sent and integrated with all the information transmitted from everyone else. The government will, then, use this data to determine the best policies and their timing for responding to the coronavirus crisis, and presumably any other social and economic targets aimed for in the future.

The wider context, therefore, of Dr. Coyle’s analysis and proposal is that national and global interdependencies lead to the conclusion that beyond the current health crisis, governments and others associated with governments should have the latitude to collect and utilize a wide variety of bits of information about everyone, everywhere, all the time.

Otherwise, you or I or anyone else might do something as consumer or producer, buyer or seller, proponent or recipient of ideas, attitudes, and actions that might have potentially unwanted or undesired impacts on others, somewhere, that might be considered by someone in the data retrieval and analysis authority to need some type of government policy response.

Now, I am confident that if the argument was expressed to Dr. Coyle in this way, she would respond that I am reading too much into it. First, the data can be collected and utilized in ways that leave individuals “anonymous” in terms of from whom it has been ultimately collected. And, its purpose is only for determining and tracing out aggregate trends and patterns found relevant in some way for various policy purposes important for social coordination, stability, or betterment.

Governments Knowing Everything Can Control Everyone

Let us not forget that such things as social coordination, stability and betterment are not independent of the eyes of the beholder, and especially in the arena of public policy-making since whatever the government does potentially impacts large numbers if not everyone in society. Nor it is free of the changing historical circumstances of who is in political power with access to and use of such data. Such concerns and suspicions are not merely hypotheticals held by those who may be extraordinarily sensitive about individual liberty and privacy matters

Just look at China, where over the last few years, the communist government has been setting up a “social credit system,” under which Chinese citizens are expected to download and keep active and accessible to the political authorities an app on their mobile devices that surveils everything they do and say, everywhere they go and with whom, every purchase and use they make of all that incorporates the affairs of ordinary everyday life.

The “good” Chinese citizens are “credited” with those activities, interactions, and purchases that the government deems to be in the social and national interest, “credits” that give individuals various perks and benefits. Those found to have acted and interacted in ways viewed by the government as “anti-social” can experience limited opportunities for travel, difficulties in purchasing an apartment, or obtaining better employment. Combined with China’s “state-of-the-art” facial recognition technology increasingly surveilling intersections, streets, alleys and highways through the country, along with drone patrols overhead, Big Brother is not a futuristic fantasy. It is here – now.

This is not just being done in China. In the name of fighting terrorism and crime, and now in the name of the needed surveillance of anti-social distancing behavior, the same technologies of tracking mobile devices and facial recognition technologies are increasingly being used in Europe, the United States and other parts of the world, and have been for a while.

In the current coronavirus crisis, such technology is being used across the U.S. to rank states and counties within states from an “A” to an “F” in terms of traced movements and interactions by people in abiding by “social distancing” rules and restrictions; this includes tracking of how many hours people have been “socializing” or communicating with each other. Also being traced are how much time is spent in sports, exercise and recreational activities while people are locked down in their homes and immediately surrounding environments. In addition, mobile devices are used to register the new patterns and amounts of consumer expenditures under the imposed shopping and other restrictions.

Private Sector Collection of Personal Data

For a good while, now, friends of freedom and civil libertarians in general have been concerned with the collection, storing, use and sharing of personal data via the apps and social media sites used by virtually everyone. There have been reasonable and serious discussions and debates about the right or acceptability of private firms on the internet sweeping up the details of their users’ activities, and using that information through the application of various algorithms in determining people’s spending habits and patterns, their interests and pursuits, their political and social values based on what they search for and read online, as well as a wide variety of other activities.

Most social media sites provide access and use for free; but there are no free lunches in the real world. If costs of offering such services are to be covered and profits possibly earned, then the social media providers must have something to sell to third parties to earn advertising and other revenues. Old-fashioned network television, before paid satellite and cable services, required viewers to put up with frequent commercial breaks while watching any show so the three major networks could earn advertising revenues, since the airwaves were accessible in every household for “free.”

Yes, I am sometimes annoyed when the streaming services I subscribe to decide what shows and films I’m interested in watching from my past viewing choices, and post their “picks” for me when I would like to just look around myself on their site without their “recommendations.” But I have sometimes discovered movies that it turns out I am interested in seeing due to their viewer “profiling” of me. Likewise, I am irritated when a search engine or a social media site decides what news or political sites fit my “profile” based on their algorithms.

I also assume that they use the information they glean from my viewing patterns for other profitable purposes. But I, personally, care less about that than the gains from the market availability of such streaming services compared to when, years ago, I was limited to what the three major networks offered based on the lowest common denominator of taste that could attract the widest audiences across America under the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) regulations on content and language.

Big Government Makes Big Data a Threat to Liberty

I wish to make clear that I do not discount or consider illegitimate or unimportant the types of concerns people have about the data mining of all of us in these ways. But whatever the pros and cons of permitted and restricted use of such information by and in the private sector, the greatest danger is the collection or acquisition of all that “big data” by government.

I can opt in or out in using some social media sites or doing more or less of my shopping online through various apps or sharing my social and political views with people on particular internet outlets. But unless I really want to go totally “under the radar” with a completely non-internet presence, including with no mobile devices or online computer uses, I cannot even attempt to fully escape from the prying eyes of government. It is the government and its use of any such data that it collects or can strong-arm private media and internet sites to share that is the most serious danger and threatening intrusion into our individual liberty and privacy.

But these are the types of information for “collective action” that someone like Dr. Diane Coyle seems to want governments to have access to and be able to use. It is a strange social psychology in our day and age that both political conservatives and “progressives” want governments to have such informational collection and use authority. Now, it is true, they see its desirability and application in different ways, but many in both groups see it as necessary for the asserted national or social good.

Conservatives and “Progressives” Both Want to Deny Privacies

Conservatives most often see the need for it in terms of national security to fight terrorism or to combat drug smugglers or to prevent “illegal aliens” from entering the country without government passport and visa permission. “Progressives” champion it to fight “hate crimes” or human traffickers (under the presumption that everyone in the sex business is a victim or a “slave”) or to enable the overseeing of social services concerning, say, health care or presumed environmental abuse, or, in the latest instance, for government to decide on and implement policy in the face of the coronavirus.

Combined, the conservative and “progressive” variations in favor of technological surveillance add up to leaving little in any person’s life being outside of the prying eyes of government. Of course, both conservatives and “progressives,” respectively, insist that its purpose is only for the national or social interest, with no intention of abuse – unless, of course, the power over its use is in the hands of the “other” group.

But that is the point: You can never know for sure who in the next electoral cycle will be the “democratic” choice that gains access to the reins of political power and therefore will have the use of those informational tools to spy on anyone or everyone. When discussing with my students the desirable limits to government authority in society, I often ask them to think of the answer to the following question: Who is the politician they trust the least and hate the most? Now imagine that that person is the one in control of all that technological surveilling power. Would they want that person to have it and to use it?

That is the reason why thoughtful people concerned with human liberty and fearful of abuse by those in political power have long argued for constitutions that narrowly define, determine and delineate the functions and responsibilities of government and those elected or appointed to serve in some capacity in its various branches. It is the only way to assure a rule of law instead of a rule of men.

The wider the governmental responsibilities over aspects of our lives, the more the discretionary authority that must come with it. That also means the greater its use in ways that deny and abuse freedom instead of protecting people’s individual rights to their life, liberty and honestly acquired property, including the right of peaceful association both within the marketplace and outside of it in the other institutions of voluntary civil society.

Free Markets Overcome the Conflict Between Individuals and Society

Fundamental to Dr. Coyle’s view is a dichotomy and a tension that she sees between the individual and society. It is certainly the case that throughout history, individuals through the use or threat of private or political force have attempted to use and abuse others for their own gain.

Marauding bandits or conquering kings and princes seized and laid claim to the lands and properties of their victims, and often enslaved those they found it advantageous not to kill. Here in stark contrast was the conflict between the individual and other members of society. The use or the intimidation of physical force enabled some to make others obey and serve.

Since Dr. Coyle refers to Adam Smith and the benefits to all in society from the greater productivity and wider variety of things made possible by division of labor, it is almost embarrassing to have to remind her of the social and institutional context in which Smith explained how this all became possible for a growing circle of participants.

In the market society, individual interest and gain are harnessed to the betterment of others in society precisely by making it necessary for each to associate in what Smith called a “system of natural liberty,” under which each collaborates and cooperates on the basis of voluntary agreement and mutual again. If I cannot kill you, or rob or defraud, or make you my slave, then the only way I can obtain what you have is by offering you something in exchange that makes it worthwhile and advantageous for you to enter into a transaction with me.

As Smith famously said, the essence of every trade is, if you give this to me which I want, I will give you something else in exchange that you desire. It is through this method of human association that we receive the benefits of the abilities, talents, and productive possibilities of all the other members of society; just as they, in turn, gain what we can do for them.

The more extensive and intensive the division of labor, the more dependent each of us is upon multitudes of people who we personally know little or nothing about. We are strangers to each other, whether we are strangers in parts of the same town or city, or across national boundaries and halfway around the world.

Market Prices and Personal Data to Coordinate Everyone’s Actions

What connects us is precisely the social network of markets, prices, and local and international competition. The supply-chains of resources, production, wholesale delivery and retail sale are all kept in structured and coordinated order through the information and incentives provided through the price system, and the networks of localized data about people and markets that interconnect to serve the personal purposes of each attempting to do the best they can as buyer and seller, consumer and producer, and employer and employee in their respective corners of the world.

Businesses want various types of collected data to complement and to fill in the details that prices and other market informational sources provide so they may make more informed and forethoughtful decisions on what and how to produce, with the hope of profits instead of losses. If our privacy seems to be being pried into, private enterprises in the market use that data to get better “pictures” of us as individuals and subgroups in society as potential buyers of existing or new and better goods and services they are attempting to make attractive for us to be willing and interested in purchasing.

Yes, private businesses try to influence all of us in trying to find out what we want or are interested in, and in what ways advertising and offering us goods and services are more likely to get our attention and the spending of our dollars in their direction rather than someone else’s.

Rationalizing Paternalism by Assuming Others are Irresponsible

But while private enterprises may try to sway us through what they learn about us, they cannot compel us to buy what they are trying to sell. Unless we think of ourselves as mindless and passively responding automatons, we all have the capacity to look before we leap, to say “No” rather than saying “Yes” to everything a seller says or offers. Most of us assume that in most instances we are more intelligent than that.

We too often give into the presumption of a seller’s mind control over others because we too easily assume that while we can usually see through any influencing manipulation, it is the other person who is too weak-minded and thoughtless to be trusted with the latitude and liberty to say yes or no on his own. So, “we” need the political overseer because others in society cannot be trusted with the freedom to choose on their own. We support and call for it, often, because of our concerns for the irresponsibility or ignorance of others in society.

Of course, in many instances those others are thinking the same about us and support the same political paternalism because they consider us to be too unenlightened to live and choose on our own without that political protecting and guiding hand. So, each thinks freedom must be denied, to one extent or another, because each thinks the other to be too weak-minded to have a fuller liberty, while each rarely thinks of themselves as needing that same government control over their choices and actions. If only there was a way for each to retain their freedom while the others who need that watching over are given the government’s restricting and regulating helping oversight!

The fundamental problem is that governments do not “reason” with people to get them to follow what those in government want others to do or not to do. Government forces our compliance through their legitimized authority to use coercion. Don’t follow social distancing decrees and you may be fined or arrested, including because you jogged in a park, or took a walk on a beach, or shopped for or offered something the political authority insists you should not.

The More Government Controls in Society, the Big Data Needed

Why does government need that “big data?” Without it, how can government know enough to assure that we do not do things they don’t want us to do? Examples are the ones we mentioned earlier: trying to stop illegal drug dealing or to prevent “hateful” thoughts or actions. That is, to prohibit or restrict actions that may not involve private uses of force or fraud, but which those in political power declare to be “bad” for us or harmful to others if we are allowed to do it or say it.

The big data also is wanted because the government’s reach has extended into many aspects of life which in a freer society would not be the concern of those in elected or appointed political office. Government needs to know our eating, drinking, exercising and related social habits because government has already taken over so much authority and control over the health industry and the medical health insurance business.

Government oversees our retirement, our workplace wages and work conditions, the forms and types of goods we produce and consume, the way we grow and market crops, the way we manufacture goods for domestic and foreign sale. Also increasingly in the purview of government is how we interact with others in our words and deeds, including how many of us there are in various social, gender, ethnic and racial groups because how else can government monitor and manipulate the association of people into patterns the political paternalists know to be better or even best?

The big data is needed, therefore, to more heavy-handedly make us act in ways wanted or to “nudge” us in the desired directions through manipulation of the right fiscal or regulatory incentives to get the responses out of us that those in and around government just know to be “good for us.”

Getting us to accept and even support more of this government intrusion and data mining into our private affairs is one of the great dangers facing us in the coronavirus crisis. It is why it is important not to fall into the trap of thinking, as Diane Coyle wants us to, that this pandemic should be taken to mean “the end of individualism.” It should, instead, remind us of the dangers from and the need to impose limits on government at all levels.

The “individualism” that Dr. Coyle scornfully criticizes is really the liberty of each one of us to more fully design and direct our own lives in peaceful and mutually productive associations inside and outside of the marketplace, rather than turning that freedom over to the political paternalists desiring to tell us how to live, think and act, and, of course, all for our own good.

""It's always a great day to feel healthy after what I went through,"" he said.

Just three weeks ago, he was discharged after a battle against COVID-19.

""I started wondering, how bad is this going to be?"" he said. ""Am I close to dying?

Clark took part in a groundbreaking global trial with early results that showed remdesivir reduced average hospitalizations from 15 to 11 days.

Dr. Aneesh Mehta was the lead investigator of the National Institute of Health trial at Emory University, where she is chief of infectious diseases.

""I think remdesivir, it's going to be one important tool, but we also need to look for other ways to help our patients,"" Mehta said.

In the next phase of the trial, Mehta and her colleagues are adding even more fire power to the fight against COVID-19.

Combining remdesivir — to stop the virus from multiplying — with a powerful anti-inflammatory drug, Baricitinib, a so-called immune modulator that aims to prevent organ damage by calming down an inflamed immune system.

Remdesivir stops the virus from replicating inside the cell. and the immune modulator puts out the fire.

""What the remdesivir here does is it stops the spark and the immune modulator will hopefully be putting dirt on the fire to put it out,"" Mehta said. "" A one-two punch.""



Mehta's team is looking at whether this powerful combination could make recovery even faster and possibly reduce the mortality rate.in a way remdesivir alone has not yet been shown to do.

It's a multiple-drug strategy based on years of AIDS research.

""A drug can block this virus,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government's top infectious disease expert, when he announced remdesivir was the first drug shown to be effective in treating COVID-19.

It was reminiscent of a time more than three decades ago when the first HIV treatment emerged.

""It was reminiscent of 34 years ago, in 1986, when we were struggling for drugs for HIV and we had nothing,"" Fauci said.

It took nearly 10 years to show a combination of drugs was needed to treat AIDS. Now they're applying that lesson learned to COVID-19.",real

For the latest COVID-19 statistics, updated in near real time, millions of people around the world have been turning to an interactive, Web-based dashboard created by a small team at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.

From its humble beginnings, that dashboard has become one of the world's most authoritative sources for the latest coronavirus numbers and trends. The project has filled an information vacuum, providing the most up-to-date, comprehensive picture of the virus' global scope and spread.

The dashboard was born, as these things often are, under the influence of caffeine.

""We were sitting around a table. We were all drinking lattes,"" recalls Lauren Gardner, 35, associate professor of civil and systems engineering at Johns Hopkins.

This was back on Jan. 21. Gardner, whose specialty is modeling the spread of infectious diseases such as Zika, dengue and measles, had been paying close attention to early reports of a deadly new virus spreading in China.

At that meeting over coffee, she asked Ensheng Dong, a first-year Ph.D. student she advises, if he had been following news of the coronavirus. He had. Dong, 30, is from Shanxi province in China, and he knew there had been confirmed cases in his hometown.

""I really worry about my family over there,"" he told Gardner.

What's more, Dong has a lot of friends who live in Wuhan, which was then at the heart of the epidemic.

""I could see their numbers growing larger and larger every day,"" Dong says.

Gardner had an idea.

""She mentioned, 'Why don't we make a dashboard?' "" Dong says. ""I'm thinking, 'Yes. Why not?!' ""

So, Dong got busy, and by that same night he had created a dashboard showing cases of the disease, COVID-19, caused by the novel coronavirus.

Back then, his map was splashed with just a smattering of red circles, indicating a grand total of 320 confirmed cases. Nearly all of them were in China; a handful more were in Thailand, Japan and South Korea.

Over the months that followed, as the epidemic turned into a pandemic and as the number of confirmed cases grew from several hundred to nearly 2 million, Dong watched those red circles on the map spread steadily and fast, all over the globe.

""It's kind of a bloody map,"" Dong says. ""There's so many red dots everywhere.""

In the first few weeks, Dong was entering all of the data by himself, manually plugging the numbers of confirmed cases, recoveries and deaths into the dashboard. That quickly turned into a monumental task. Now, nearly all of the data are entered automatically.

As the dashboard grew more popular and demand surged, there were times when the servers crashed.

""Actually, if I ever knew that this project will go [so] big, maybe I would [reconsider doing] that!"" Dong jokes.

For Gardner, who manages the dashboard project for Johns Hopkins' Center for Systems Science and Engineering, it's a role that has become all-consuming.

""I didn't envision being dashboard person — that's for sure,"" she says, noting that the dashboard she first envisioned as a valuable tool for academic research has evolved into something far bigger.

""I think what we massively underestimated was the general public's interest,"" she says. ""It didn't even cross our mind how popular the interface would be. ... People are just really desperate for information that they trust.""

The Hopkins team scrapes its numbers from dozens of sources, including the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Health Organization, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, as well as U.S. state health departments and media-aggregating websites.

The dashboard team has grown from two members to a couple of dozen, and they're constantly working on new features. This week, they've added maps showing per capita rates of COVID-19 testing, hospitalization and incidence, as well as case-fatality ratios.

The team would love to have other data made available, including the race and gender of COVID-19 patients, according to Dong.

The Hopkins dashboard is open-source, made freely available to users. Thousands of other dashboards, including NPR's, pull the Hopkins data into their own. ""And I think that's awesome,"" Gardner says.

Beyond the snapshot of what is happening now, the data are also being used to do modeling, which in turn drives state and federal policy. ""We're absolutely doing short-term forecasting,"" Gardner says, ""looking at what are the next spatial hot spots. Where should we be allocating resources to better prepare for the next city or the next state that's gonna see a surge in cases?""

The Hopkins team also recently joined in a study from NASA, modeling how climate and seasonality are contributing to the coronavirus outbreak.

As the dashboard project goes on, Dong says what began with him worrying about his family in China has flipped. With the U.S. now bearing the brutal brunt of the pandemic, he says, it's his family's turn to worry about him.",real

The young man, who has not been named, was transferred from an Ann Arbor hospital to Detroit’s Westwood Nursing Center last week after contracting the coronavirus, his father told local media. He later appeared in disturbing footage repeatedly punching an elderly man in the face. While the suspect has since been arrested for the assault, it remains unclear how or why he ended up at the nursing home in the first place, given that seniors are among the most vulnerable to the lethal illness.

“He never should have been housed – quarantined – with the victim that he eventually assaulted. That should have never happened,” the man’s father said, adding: “Someone dropped the ball.”

He has [mental] issues and for them to put him in a facility like that, nothing good was going to happen.

Prior to the attack that was captured on video – apparently filmed by the assailant himself – the suspect already faced charges in nearby Washtenaw County, where he is accused of assaulting a staff member at another facility. While acknowledging his son’s severe behavioral and mental problems, the father said he “never would have consented” to sending him to a nursing home had he been informed of it. It is still unknown who made the decision to transfer him there.

Some mystery also surrounds the 75-year-old victim of the nursing home assault. Relatives told local press that they began to worry when they were unable to reach him by phone, explaining that, for reasons that are still unclear, he was taken from his Detroit apartment and brought to the Westwood center. The man is now recovering from his injuries at a nearby hospital.

The incident has sparked widespread outrage, even drawing the attention of US President Donald Trump. The backlash has only been intensified with the latest revelation, prompting a flood of criticism and questions from critics online.

As patrons potentially flock to bars and restaurants over the holiday weekend, extra undercover agents will be out to observe, educate and, if necessary, enforce the state’s public health order to thwart the spread of coronavirus.

The agents are part of the Ohio Investigative Unit, which is made up of plainclothes peace officers responsible for enforcing Ohio’s alcohol, tobacco and food stamp fraud laws.

Along with looking for criminal activity, the officers now are tasked with watching for potential violations of the state’s health order for restaurants and bars to safely operate during the coronavirus pandemic.

The agents can issue administrative citations, which could lead to a hearing with the Ohio Liquor Control Commission. Possible penalties include fines, suspensions or even revoking a business’ liquor permit.

“We just don’t know the compliance rate out there,” Ohio Investigative Unit Enforcement Commander Eric Wolf said. “We certainly expect that a vast majority of the places we visit will be in compliance and do what they have to do.”

Gov. Mike DeWine announced May 18 that members would be added to the investigative unit to check for compliance at bars and restaurants.

Wolf said the undercover agents don’t have a set checklist, but they will look for things such as groups larger than 10, patrons congregating in open areas or around the bar or people using pool tables and video games -- all things still not allowed under the state health order.

This will be in addition to their normal duties, like checking for underage alcohol sales and over serving, Wolf said.

To help the unit as bars and restaurants reopen their dining rooms, Wolf said the agency is adding the help of sworn officers from other agencies. Officers from the Ohio Casino Control Commission will be teaming up with the Ohio Investigative Unit. Locally, the Stark County Sheriff’s Office will be pairing deputies with agents as well, Wolf said.

The agents generally work in pairs, Wolf said, and the extra help will let them about double the amount of teams they can send out. In an ideal situation where businesses are following the rules, Wolf said officers would “leave without an establishment knowing we were even there.”

Wolf said the two main goals are observation and education. If a business is doing mostly everything right but has one or two problems, he said an officer would likely just address the issue, and help the owners comply.

He said a big part of enforcing the health order is making sure patrons also know what they need to do to comply and be safe.

“At the same time, we’re trying to get the message out that it’s the patrons' responsibility as well,” Wolf said.

Officers have been doing similar checks while bars and restaurants reopened patios. Wolf said by-and-large, the agency saw very few incidents in which they had to issue violations.

If there is an issue that rises to a violation, Wolf said it would be filed against the business’ liquor permit, and lead to a hearing with the liquor control commission.

Agents will not be shutting down businesses, he said.

The biggest question is what businesses will look like as they reopen. Wolf said people will likely fall into two camps: those who aren’t ready to dine in yet, and those who are cooped up and ready to get out of the house. He said it’s hard to know how many people will fall in each category.

“I’m curious as just about anyone out there on what’s going to happen this weekend,” Wolf said. “We just don’t know.”

Wolf said the Ohio Investigative Unit has committed to bringing on extra officers for at least two weeks. Wolf said this will let them spread out as much as they can, and help people comply, if necessary.

“That’s the biggest push is just more observation and education, and to make sure that everyone has a good and safe holiday weekend,” Wolf said.

Some of the most senior government officials assigned to the coronavirus crisis briefed House lawmakers Friday, and assured them that the Trump administration is not impeding their work or their communications with the public.

Representatives on both sides of the aisle have lauded some aspects of the outbreak response, while voicing frustration with others.

""I support the administration's declaration of a public health emergency,"" said Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., in her opening remarks to the briefing. ""That said, I have grave concerns about the lack of transparency and unwillingness to allow public health experts to speak freely about what is happening. ""

After reports Thursday that Vice President Mike Pence's office would be coordinating all government communications about the virus' spread, Dr. Anthony Fauci told lawmakers at Friday's briefing that he would be backing out of a series of T.V. interviews this weekend.

Fauci is the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and is among the country's leading experts on contagious diseases. He told lawmakers that the decision had to do with the changing leadership around the coronavirus this week.

On Wednesday, Pence was tapped by Trump to spearhead the administration's response, and the vice president's office announced Thursday that it had named a separate coronavirus coordinator.

""Dr. Fauci said that when everything changed over to the Vice President being given the authority to lead the effort, Dr. Fauci had been already booked on a number of programs,"" said Rep. Mark Takano, D-Calif. ""He said to everyone — I am not being muzzled, I want to clear that up.""

Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who is among the Trump administration's most vocal critics, said he believed Fauci.

""The President has made so many false statements on so many things you can't really rely on the White House, but thankfully we do have good career people at the agencies and we are going to rely on them to be candid with us,"" Schiff said. ""At the same time, I think [Fauci] should have been permitted to keep the commitments that he had made... He's among the most knowledgeable in the federal government.""

White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Friday that there was ""no hard and fast process"" about requiring permission from the vice president's office before making public comment, but that the administration was trying to ""coordinate our messages.""

""No one's being stifled, no one's being told what to say,"" Kudlow told reporters inside the White House. ""You've got veterans in [the National Institutes of Health] and CDC with immense knowledge of these things, they've been through this before, and we're all ears.""

""We want to hear what they have to say,"" he said, adding, ""there's a big difference between stifling and coordinating.""

In an appearance at the Conservative Political Action Conference, Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said Democratic members of Congress were only complaining about transparency regarding the coronavirus in an effort to ""bring down the president.""

He said the administration was holding sparsely attended hearings about the outbreak weeks ago, but Democrats only started caring once impeachment proceedings were over.

""Is [coronavirus] real? It is absolutely real,"" Mulvaney said, before also noting that the fatality rate of the virus is lower than other recent global outbreaks like Ebola and SARS.

Mulvaney also bemoaned how media organizations have covered the outbreak, saying he recommended one way to calm the financial markets that have been in freefall this week is by ""telling people to turn off their televisions for 24 hours.""

Testing concerns

After Friday's briefing, many members voiced frustration with the slow response from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, specifically related to testing for the coronavirus.

California representatives like Rep. John Garamendi, whose district includes one of the military bases where people who have been evacuated from China are being quarantined, says health officials say they have updated policies that made it difficult to test a wide range of people who presented symptoms associated with the COVID-19 virus.

""They had very strict protocols that said you cannot get tested unless you can show that you were coming from China and then exposed to those who were here that came from China,"" Garamendi told reporters after a briefing. ""That protocol prohibited testing. Ultimately, can they explain why they did it? Stupidity. That's my word, not theirs.""

Garamendi and others say they are also frustrated that there is a shortage of accurate tests available to health care workers in the U.S.

""They sat on their hands for two months,"" Garamendi said. ""Tests are readily available from Korea, now.""

Others, including Rep. Michael Burgess, R-Texas, who was a practicing physician until his election in 2003, says he is concerned that the number of cases in the U.S. will inevitably grow and the number of tests available is insufficient.

""We have kind of moved from the days of containment to mitigation,"" Burgess said. ""My understanding is that two weeks ago there was a test that was being distributed and then there was a question about the efficacy.""

Indeed, a problem with one ingredient in test kits that the CDC distributed to labs around the country created a frustrating bottleneck in testing, requiring most testing to occur at the CDC in Atlanta, as NPR's Rob Stein has reported. The CDC announced Thursday that it had resolved the issue.

Congress is in agreement that emergency funding is needed to address the outbreak, which has infected more than 80,000 people worldwide and more than a dozen people in the U.S., but House and Senate leaders are still haggling over the exact figures.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Thursday that his chamber will consider a supplemental funding plan for the coronavirus within the next two weeks, and Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Congress was ""coming close to a bipartisan agreement.""

The number two Senate Democratic leader, Sen. Dick Durbin, tweeted Friday that Pence reached out to him about working together.

And on Friday, lawmakers still tried to project a sense of calm about the virus.

""People shouldn't panic,"" said Rep. Joe Morelle, D-N.Y. ""The risk right now in the United States is very low.""",real

Listening to many politicians and political pundits, and even some “economists,” you could easily think that 250 years of economic understanding had never happened. One of the oldest of economic fallacies is that money is wealth; that is, the notion that if you create pieces of paper, put some kind of government stamp on it announcing that it is “money,” and spread it around among the members of society, you thereby conjure up from nothing actual material and other forms of wealth.

Money is a medium of exchange, some commodity or other useful thing that is found widely advantageous to use as a convenient intermediary to better facilitate the exchange of other goods and services one for the other when more direct barter transactions are found to be impossible to arrange or more costly to carry out.

Printing Money Does Not Magically Create Goods

But increasing the number of units of the particular item used as money does not, in itself, increase the physical quantities of all the other goods that people want to acquire through exchange to satisfy their wants and desires. These other goods that people actually want must be produced, manufactured, transported and made ready in the forms and at the places desired by members of society. They do not fall from the sky and do not miraculously appear by waving pieces of paper money (or their electronic and computer equivalents) above your head after offering some incantation to the “manna from heaven” god.

This was all understood and even popularized for the general public by political economists in the early 19th century, when “economics” was the trendy and “in” subject about which any publicly minded and intelligent member of British and American society wanted to be knowledgeable and informed. Yes, there was a time, in spite of Thomas Carlyle’s famous quip, when economics was not considered to be the “dismal science.” It was the subject essential to any thinking and thoughtful person to understand the social world in which he lived, and the political and institutional circumstances most conducive to the betterment of the human condition, especially the improvement of the poor.

For instance, Harriet Martineau (1802-1876), a leading British classical liberal-oriented feminist, abolitionist, social critic, novelist, and historian, successfully popularized the fundamental ideas of economics in a 9-volume series offering, Illustrations of Political Economy (1834), in the form of narrative stories of ordinary people through whom the principles of economic theory and practice were made real and relevant to millions of readers on both sides of the Atlantic.

In the first volume, for instance, a group of settlers in a faraway land are pillaged and plundered by a marauding band, leaving them with nothing to start over with other than their physical strength, the knowledge inside their heads, and whatever raw materials and wild animals were in their immediate vicinity. From this, she shows that the “ultimate resource” is the human being himself with the creative potentials inside people’s minds, combined with resolute determination to work, save, invest, and produce to create through time the prosperity and well-being that we call civilization.

A Sack of Gold is Not the Same as a Stock of Desired Goods

Shortly after the initial disaster has struck and the little band has tried to get through their first day with nothing left to help themselves with other than their own heads and their own hands, two of the group reflect on their misfortune and circumstances, including that just having money is not to have wealth. One of them says,

“I wish that the people of England, who think that wealth consists in gold, and silver, and bank notes, would come here and see how much their money is worth in our settlement. A thousand sovereigns would not here buy a hat, nor a roll of bank notes a loaf of bread. Here, at least, money is not wealth.”

His companion replies:

“Nor anywhere else, as we may see by putting a very simple case. Put a man with a bag of gold into an empty house, in England, or anywhere else, and he will starve in a week, unless he is allowed to give his gold in exchange for what will supply his wants. But give a man, who has not a shilling, a room well stocked with meat, and bread, and beer, and he has wealth enough to maintain him for a week, or a fortnight, as long as his provision lasts. And this is a test which holds good all the world over . . .

Wealth is made up of many things – of land, of clothes, furniture, food and of the means (whether gold and silver or anything else) by which these things may be obtained . . . Poor as we are, we are richer than if we were in the midst of the sandy desert to the north of us, with a wagon full of gold in our possession. We have what gold and silver could not buy in such a place, food and shelter.”

They go on to ruminate on the fact that though their situation is better than in a desert because there are edible plants, raw materials useable in various productions, and wild animals that may be eaten or harnessed to assist them in their work, none of these are, as yet, directly useful things until they have applied their knowledge and human labor to transform them into either the productive tools (capital) with which their work may be made possible or easier and more productive, or into the consumable and useable finished consumer items to satisfy their actual wants.

The first reminds his friend that, “Even the manna in the wilderness would have been of no more use to the Hebrews than the carp in the pool to us, if they had not exerted themselves to gather it up. Food was never yet rained into the mouth of any man.” To which his companion adds, “And if it had been, he must have troubled to hold back his head and open his mouth. So, you see what conclusion we come to, even in an extreme case.”

Forgetting that Production Comes Before Consumption

Maybe because two hundred years ago so many more in the world were still so close to abject poverty – it is estimated that in 1820 the world population numbered barely one billion of which nearly 90 percent lived in serious or severe material want – that most people understood two centuries ago when reminded about the reality of their daily life, that production comes before plenty, that work is necessary if you are to have wealth. This is less the case today when out of over 7.7 billion people only about 10 percent are subject to the lowest of material circumstances, Far too many in 2020 think that the things of everyday life just “somehow” appear and are waiting and ready to be bought if you have but money in your pocket.

So, give people money and they can pay their rent or mortgage, buy food at the supermarket, and purchase medicines or shoes, because, well, all those things are just “there” every day when and as you want them. Oh, yes, there can be panic buying, as was commonly seen in February and March of this year when people went crazy purchasing huge quantities of toilet paper, hand sanitizers, protective masks, and a variety of storable food items.

But these concerns all had to do with presumed failures on the part of politicians and private enterprises to know way ahead of time that they should have made sure there were more of all these and other things readily available in any maximum quantity that consumers wanted right then and there. It was just supposed to be there. Clearly another “failure” of capitalism or inept government planning because the “wrong people” were in charge.

What the government lockdown policy response to the coronavirus has highlighted is the fundamental and inescapable truth of what the 19th French economist, Jean-Baptiste Say (1767-1832), called “the law of markets.” Contrary to the reawakened Keynesian mindset that all of our economic troubles are “aggregate demand failures” arising from a lack of spending due to people not having enough money in their pockets, the dramatic collapse in production, the massive rise in unemployment, and the falling off in people’s spending on final goods and services are all due to governments shutting down the “supply-side” of the economy.

Our Ability to “Demand” Arises from Our Capacities to “Supply”

As Jean-Baptiste Say, and those who followed his reasoning, argued, there is always work to be done, since there are always human wants that are as yet not fully satisfied; and as soon as one such human want has been significantly fulfilled to one degree or another, the human mind looks ahead and imagines other things that seem attractive and desirable to have. As a result, work merely of different sorts is there to be taken up in even greater amounts.

People may satisfy their wants and desires in one of two ways, Say explained. They may directly work and produce the goods they want for their own purposes. Few of our desires, however, can be fulfilled through our own personal efforts. So, the other way is to work and produce something that others might consider worth buying from us in exchange for what they can offer in trade; that is, goods that we want that either we do not have the ability to make for ourselves or only at higher costs than at which that potential trading partner can sell them to us.

Of course, in modern society rare are the occasions in which we directly trade what we have for sale in exchange for what we actually want from another person. Usually, we first sell what we offer to someone interested in our wares for an agreed upon price in the form of a sum of money, and having earned that money from partly fulfilling someone else’s wants, we use the money that we have so earned to then offer it to some other person in the market for that which we actually want that they are able to supply.

I trade my labor services to the institution of higher learning that hires me to teach economics, and I then turn around and spend the money I’ve earned on the goods and services I’m interested in buying from people who may have no interest in economics, and certainly not in accepting some economics lectures from me in direct trade for what they have that I want.

Money Earned Comes before Money to Spend

My ability to demand what others may have for sale is dependent upon my success in producing and supplying something that some of those others might be willing to purchase from me, and from which I earn the money income as a producer that enables me to demand the outputs of others as a consumer. In logical, sequential time, my ability to produce, supply and sell precedes my capacity to demand, buy, and consume.

“Today,” I may be both demanding and supplying. But my ability to demand (money earned in my pocket available to spend) has come from having sold something in the past and earned that money from prior sales (even if the past is merely a month or week, a day or a few hours earlier).

Of course, I may demand more goods in the present, in money terms, than I have earned from recently supplying in the past. But I can do so only if I draw upon my own savings from having spent less than I have earned in the past or by using the borrowed savings of others with the promises to pay it back with interest out of my current or future earnings.

In all of these cases of demanding out of what I have recently earned, or previously saved, or borrowed from someone else’s savings, what that sum of money will buy, in general, in the marketplace – a dollar’s purchasing power over goods available for sale – will depend on two things: how much of desired goods have been produced in the past and are available for purchase in the present, and the concurrent money demands of others also wishing to buy the same desired goods.

Speaking of the economy as a whole, if supplies in general decrease or total money demands increase, the prices of goods in general will tend to rise. Not all prices would rise at the same time nor proportionally with each other but based upon the relative greater scarcities of each of the fewer goods on the market as a whole, and the particular degrees of relative demands for specific goods out of the greater quantity of money in people’s pockets in general.

Shutdowns the Cause of Falling Output and Rising Unemployment

What we are witnessing at the present time has been a dramatic falling off in people’s ability to demand desired goods partly due to government decrees, especially imposed at the state levels in the U.S., that have prevented interested and willing buyers from demanding all that they would like to purchase, particularly in the retail and service sectors of the American economy. This has led to a huge rise in unemployment in these sectors of the economy. At the same time, the imposed halting of production except for what state governments have declared to be “essential” manufacturing and supplying has resulted in massive layoffs in, yet, other sectors of the economy.

In the Employment Situation report for April 2020, issued by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (May 8, 2020), the government’s official measured unemployment rate, for the economy as a whole, rose from 3.5 percent in February of this year to 14.7 percent in April.

However, there is another measurement used by the BLS known as “U-6,” which includes not only those currently unemployed and looking for work during the last four weeks, but also those considered as only “marginally” in the labor force, as those working part time but who want to work full time, and “discouraged workers” who want to work but have stopped looking for a job. Using this more inclusive measure, the BLS reports that unemployment rose from 7 percent in February to 22.8 percent in April.

It is difficult to demand the outputs of others, when (depending on the measure) between almost 15 percent and 23 percent of the labor force finds itself not fully employed in the U.S. economy. This is especially the case in what the BLS categorizes as the “hospitality and leisure” sectors of the market, in which the Bureau reports unemployment in April was 39.3 percent.

The government’s lockdowns have, on the one hand, induced declines in production and output, at least in the short run, resulting in reduced supplies of various (though not all) goods. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) in its estimate of the 2020 first quarter Gross Domestic Production calculates that GDP may have declined by at least 4.8 percent at an annualized rate.

The restrictions on retail shopping combined with the massive fall in employment has reduced the money demands for many goods and services, and the resources that are used in manufacturing. In the jargon of mainstream macroeconomics, the velocity of the circulation of money declined during the first three months of 2020 by nearly 15 percent (M-2) and by 9.6 percent (MZM), compared to the velocity of money in the fourth quarter of 2019.

If the lockdowns proceed to be loosened as they are in the various states, and if these trillions of dollars being created by the Treasury through massive deficit spending and through expansive “lines of credit” by the Federal Reserve to support financially ailing businesses proceed as announced, it is difficult not to expect significant price inflation looking to the end of 2020 and into 2021.

The Need for Coordinated Productions Through Time

Part of the illusion of just needing money to immediately assure and bring forth the goods wanted and desired arises from the failure to fully understand that all production takes time and any disruption of the processes and stages of production threatens the entire structure of investment and manufacturing.

The real time-structure of production has been implied in discussions concerning potential breakdowns in the interdependent global supply-chains connecting resources, manufacturing, transportation, and retail marketing to the ultimate consumer. All the stages of production through which goods sequentially pass, in their own required respective ways, rely upon intricate complementary coordination if those goods are to be continually forthcoming in the desired patterns and quantities, and when they may be wanted.

The nature and logic of these relationships may be captured in the following table:

In the table, above, the number of production steps to bring a particular good to market requires 5 interdependent stages of production, each of which takes one month to complete. Thus, if this good was wanted for consumer use in May of 2020, the production on it needed to begin at the start of the year, in January.

If the same good is wanted in the same quantity and quality in June of 2020, as well, its production process had to begin in February at the same time that the quantity of the good wanted in May was going through stage 2 of its production process. In March of 2020, the good wanted in May had to be going through stage 3 of its production process, while the good wanted in June had to be passing through its stage 2, and if this good is also wanted in its finished form in July had to be starting its stage 1 of production in March.

Any stoppage or disruption in manufacturing processes and employments in any one or more of these production stages threatens, in principle, the ability for production to continue smoothly through time so the final good is available in particular amounts to the consumers wishing to demand it, period-after-period.

This highlights another aspect of Say’s Law of Markets. If there are not to be “gluts” of some goods and shortages of others, each of these interdependent markets must be coordinated through the competitive interactions of supply and demand, in which prices serve as the guiding signals and incentives to direct people in the use of their resources, capital, and labor in the needed synchronized patterns both at a moment in time and through time as goods in process pass through their required stages of production.

The Fallacy of “Essential” and “Non-Essential” Productions

Government’s insistence on distinguishing between “essential” and “nonessential” productions and consumer goods are shown for the shallow misreading it is. Markets are interconnected and interrelated in such an inescapable way that what the government tags as “non-essential” may be crucial for the maintenance and operation of other production processes that are labelled as “essential” by those in political authority.

Market relationships are too complex and overlapping for any but those in the production processes themselves at each of the respective stages of production to fully and effectively know and understand what needs to be done in changing market conditions to substitute particular resources and types of capital and labor from some parts of the structures of production to others as communicated and discovered through the relative patterns of prices and wages that convey the needed knowledge to make informed decisions so to keep productions moving forward with minimal breaks and disruptions in and across markets.

This is also why all the talk about loosening the lockdowns in “steps” over time misses the central point that all markets and the actions of the people in them are interconnected in ways that releasing some while delaying opening others threatens a successful restoring of productions and employments as soon as possible to rapidly escape from the government-created economic chaos in the shortest possible period of time without introducing other imbalances and shortages that need not happen, if not for continuing government involvement.

What is needed, and now, is the freeing of all markets from the heavy-handed restrictive commands and controls of those in political authority, if we are to restore the economy and the employments it previously and presently could offer to all those looking for work at market-determined wages and prices. Any attempt by those in political power to guide and direct this process, regardless of the reason and rationale, only gets in the way of all the members of the society reestablishing their mutually serving productions as the means for acquiring the supply-side opportunities and capacities to demand the outputs of others.

Saving Livelihoods Is “Saving Lives”

In this discussion I might be accused of avoiding why governments have intervened so pervasively and intensely into social and economic activities: to slow down and maybe remove the danger from the coronavirus through society-wide restrictions and restraints on people’s freedom to move, work and earn. That is, “saving lives” by doing all that is possible to prevent or radically slow down the spread of the virus.

But “saving lives” is inseparable from saving livelihoods. The “supply-side” earning of livings is the only means of assuring that all the goods and services needed and wanted to meet all of our requirements are there when we want them. It enables us to earn the means for demanding what others are producing and offering on the market by having supplied some of what those others desire in reciprocal trade.

Maybe I lead an especially sheltered life, but it never entered my mind that beer producers might modify their manufacturing in such a way as to be making hand sanitizing liquids, instead, to meet a suddenly much higher demand for the latter product to fight getting or spreading the coronavirus. I had not expected to drop off some shirts at the dry cleaners and discover that the owners were now producing and offering multi-layered cloth face masks on the premises to partly compensate for a large falling off of their regular business.

An essential purpose of allowing markets to be free and open in all circumstances is precisely to take advantage of what people can imagine, create, and produce to meet changing patterns of demand in their respective corners of society in ways that others might not and, indeed, cannot anticipate. The sudden anxieties in February and March about there not being enough ventilators to meet hospital needs for potential cases of respiratory failures due to the virus, saw numerous improvisations of workable substitute ventilator devices of different types, if the need had fully arisen.

As Friedrich A. Hayek brought out in The Constitution of Liberty (1960), personal and economic liberty is crucial precisely because we cannot fully know or anticipate what creative minds might imagine, the results of which we will be glad to have and benefit from, but which might never emerge if people are not free to discover and try:

“Liberty is essential in order to leave room for the unforeseeable and the unpredictable; we want it because we have learned to expect from it the opportunity of realizing many of our aims. It is because every individual knows so little and, in particular, because we rarely know which of us knows best that we trust the independent and competitive efforts of many to induce the emergence of what we shall want when we see it.”

That is why we need markets to be open and free, now, for people be make their own best decisions about the trade-offs and risks to protect themselves and their loved ones from the dangers from catching the coronavirus, and in that process to free the supply-sides of the market from government shutdowns so people may earn the means of demanding what others produce for a return to the standards of living that are possible even in the face of the current health concerns.

China’s National Health Commission said it confirmed zero new cases of the virus on Saturday – a first since the country began tallying infections in January – and reported only two suspected cases, one of them imported from abroad.

The lethal illness first emerged late last year in the Chinese city of Wuhan, spreading across the country to infect some 84,000 people, killing in excess of 4,600. But with aggressive containment measures that put tens of millions of citizens under strict lockdown, Beijing appears to have largely brought the contagion under control, reporting a only slow trickle of new cases as the virus took hold elsewhere in the world.

While the United States remains the top epicenter with more than 1.6 million infections, South America has quickly overtaken other regions for the number-two spot, with the World Health Organization (WHO) warning of a dramatic spike in cases there.

“In a sense, South America has become a new epicenter for the disease,” Dr Mike Ryan, the WHO's top emergencies expert, told a press conference on Friday, noting that Brazil is “clearly the most affected.”

Over the last week in Brazil, health officials have reported tens of thousands of new infections each day, bringing its current disease toll to more than 330,000, rapidly eclipsing Russia as the second-worst-affected nation. Brazil has also counted more than 21,000 fatal cases, nearly seven times more than Peru, the region’s next hardest-hit country.

Though no vaccine, or even a reliable treatment, currently exists for the coronavirus, Brazilian authorities have approved widespread use of the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine as a therapy, after receiving shipments of raw materials for the chemical from India last month. The drug has shown early promise as a treatment, but its effectiveness has yet to be proven in a clinical setting. A new study in the Lancet journal, meanwhile, suggests the medicine could cause heart complications and even death, showing little or no benefit to Covid-19 patients.

Since the pandemic broke out last December, more than 5.2 million people have been sickened and some 338,000 killed worldwide, making it one of the deadliest viral outbreaks since the 1918 Spanish Flu.

For the first time in their history, International Quds Day events have gone online as a result of the deadly COVID-19 pandemic.

But according to organizers of Quds Day rallies, the forced cancellation of the annual events in Iran does not mean that Iranians have forgotten Palestinians at this important period of time.

To mark the occasion this year, applications have been made to stream messages from a wide array of community leaders, activists and public figures. In this campaign, all truth-seekers in Iran have been asked to choose an anti-Israel slogan, and then join an online rally on social media to show their support for Palestine.

International Quds Day is an annual event during which demonstrators express their solidarity with the Palestinian people and their opposition to the occupation of Palestinian territories by the Zionist regime of Israel.

The day is seen as the legacy of the late founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran Imam Khomeini who officially declared the last Friday of the holy month of Ramadan as International Quds Day back in 1979.

Although this year’s Quds Day rallies have been called off as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, the support for Palestinian cause remains high. This shows that despite all difficulties Palestine will remain the first issue of the Islamic world forever.",fake

‘Many, Many Others’ Affected by Obama-Era Surveillance, Says Former CBS Reporter Sharyl Attkisson

By Rudy Takala, Mediate, May 21st, 2020, 4:44 pm

Four years after the intelligence community began to surveil some of President Donald Trump’s campaign officials, details of what that surveillance entailed are still emerging. The Justice Department is still waiting on U.S. Attorney John Durham to finish investigating. The president this month even assigned it a new nickname: “Obamagate.”

For many observers, the idea that the intelligence community would flout certain rules in order to investigate American citizens is news. But for former CBS reporter Sharyl Attkisson, “Obamagate” is just the latest development in a nearly decade-long battle.

“I would say I may not be one of the first victims, but I am one of the first people who was able to identify myself as a target of illegal spying under the Obama administration,” Attkisson told Mediaite in an interview this week. “I believe many, many others were spied on but do not know. It was only thanks to help from intelligence contacts that I even learned that government agents were spying on me. Otherwise, I never suspected it or would have known.”

Attkisson has long asserted that the feds wrongfully surveilled her electronic devices from 2011-14, part of an operation tied to her reporting on the Justice Department’s botched “Fast and Furious” gun-running scheme and, later, on the 2012 attack on the American embassy in Benghazi, Libya. A three-judge panel voted last year to dismiss a lawsuit she had filed over the issue, but in January, Attkisson moved to reopen the case, telling the court that a whistleblower had provided new information.

That information implicated five specific individuals, according to court filings — including Rod Rosenstein, a familiar target of Trump’s grievances. Court filings allege Rosenstein, who served as the Obama administration’s U.S. attorney for Maryland, “ordered the unlawful surveillance and hacking” of Attkisson’s devices. (He subsequently served as Trump’s deputy attorney general, a capacity in which he appointed Special Counsel Robert Mueller to investigate Trump’s staffers.)

Rosenstein has denied the charges, arguing that the case should not be allowed to proceed based on information from an anonymous informant. “Nowhere do the Attkissons provide any more information to credit their accusations based on this supposed anonymous source,” Rosenstein’s attorneys wrote in an April motion to dismiss the case. “Not who communicated with the individual, how the plaintiffs received information from that person, where that person worked … or what that person knows about the alleged ‘incursions’ into the plaintiffs’ electronic devices.”

Despite Rosenstein’s departure from the Justice Department last year, conservatives have had issues with the way the department has been managed under Attorney General William Barr. Those fault lines became more visible on Monday, when Barr said he didn’t expect Durham’s review to involve the charge that either President Barack Obama or former Vice President Joe Biden had acted criminally. Trump told reporters later in the day that he was “a little surprised by that statement.”

Attkisson said the department has a tendency to protect its own regardless of which president is in power. While she declined to criticize Barr specifically, she highlighted that the problem included former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who resigned in 2018 and is presently running for his old Senate seat in Alabama — without Trump’s support.

“Prior to becoming attorney general, Sen. Jeff Sessions told an acquaintance he was well aware of what had happened to me with the government computer intrusions, and that it was shameful,” Attkisson told Mediaite. “But when he became attorney general, the Justice Department continued using taxpayer funds to fight my case. Numerous members of Congress for years, including several of them recently, have asked the FBI and Justice Department for information about the case, under two presidents, multiple attorneys general and multiple FBI directors, but they continue to get stiff-armed.”

It will also be at least another month until the judiciary decides if new facts will be allowed to emerge. The court hearing the case suspended operations in March as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and is not set to reopen until mid-to-late June.

Attkisson said it would be appropriate for Trump to weigh in on the matter and to direct his Justice Department to examine other Americans who may have been the subject of surveillance in recent years.

“Certainly he is entitled to give direction to his Justice Department, as all presidents do, and convey priorities,” she said. “It seems to me that there are dishonest actors who have tried to convince him that he is not entitled to do these things. I do think somebody at the Justice Department should review the forensic evidence proving the government source of the intrusions, if there were any doubt, offer an immediate apology, stop fighting the lawsuit, begin an honest investigation as to who was responsible and who else was spied on.”",fake
1680,https://www.dailynews.com/2020/05/21/ucla-report-says-minorities-disproportionately-affected-by-coronavirus/,2020-05-21,UCLA report says minorities disproportionately affected by coronavirus,"California’s minority communities, particularly Latinos, Pacific Islanders and African Americans, are experiencing higher rates of coronavirus cases compared to Caucasians, according to a report released Thursday, May 21, by UCLA’s Center for the Study of Latino Health and Culture.

The report, based on a study of COVID-19 exposure by six different age groups, found that almost in every age category, Latinos, African Americans and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders have higher case rates for COVID-19 than whites. This is an indicator that these racial populations are experiencing varying degrees of greater exposure to the virus than whites, said David E. Hayes-Bautista, professor of medicine and the center’s director.

For example, in the 0-17 age group, Latinos have the highest number of cases, with 31.8 per 100,000 people compared to 8.6 cases among whites. In the 18-34 age group, Pacific Islanders have nearly 300 cases per 100,000 compared to 72.9 among whites. The number of coronavirus cases gets higher among Latinos, African Americans and Pacific Islanders as the age of the individuals increases.

Latinos, in particular, are vulnerable because they serve in a lot of jobs at essential businesses, Hayes-Bautista said.

“They are the farm workers who grow and pick food, meat packers, truck drivers, grocery stockers, checkout clerks, auto mechanics, bus drivers and attendants in nursing homes,” he said. “They have a high rate of exposure. But they were also the last ones to get personal protective equipment like masks and gloves. So it’s not surprising at all that they have higher case rates.”

Latinos and Asians also tend to “live more densely,” and often multiple generations share the same home, Hayes-Bautista said.

“The cost of housing in California is horrendously high and wages for these essential workers are not very high,” he said. “So you have senior citizens, younger wage earners and children living together. When the wage earners or essential workers go to work and come back home, they are likely infecting the others in the home.”

New statistics released by the APM Research Lab on Wednesday, May 20, titled “The Color of Coronavirus,” showed that, nationwide, African Americans have died at a rate of 50.3 per 100,000 people compared with 20.7 for whites, 22.9 for Latinos and 22.7 for Asian Americans. Nationwide, more than 20,000 African Americans have died from the coronavirus.

Minority populations also suffer as a result of not being able to afford health insurance or obtain it because they are undocumented. Luz Gallegos, community programs director at the TODEC Legal Center, a Perris-based immigrant assistance group, said Latino immigrants, in particular, have been hard-hit by the coronavirus pandemic because of the Trump administration’s public charge rule that could deny green cards to immigrants who use social services such as food stamps, cash assistance or public housing, she said.

“People don’t want to get tested or be on the radar as having tested positive,” she said. “So they are spreading the virus within their families or within local communities.”

Banning supervised visits significantly harms the bond between parent and child and sets vulnerable families up for failure.

As the Cook County public defender, I represent nearly 3,000 parents whose families are DCFS-involved. My clients are poor, and most are parents of color. The visitation ban has negatively impacted already fragile families depriving them of much needed time to bond and stay bonded with their children.

Many parents have very young children who cannot communicate via phone or video conferencing, and because of this ban they are deprived of the opportunity to see, touch and hold their young children. Even mothers who breastfeed their infant children are prevented from doing so.

The Children’s Bureau of the United States Department of Health and Human Services has provided guidance on how foster care cases should be handled during this crisis. The Children’s Bureau explained that child protection courts should continue with their mission of reuniting families and doing the business of child welfare agencies.

As the Children’s Bureau has advised:

“Family time is important for child and parent well-being, as well as for efforts toward reunification. Family time is especially important during times of crisis. The Children’s Bureau strongly discourages the issuance of blanket orders that are not specific to each child and family that suspend family time; doing so is contrary to the well-being and best interest of children, may contribute to additional child trauma, and may impede the likelihood of reunification.”

Gov. J.B. Pritzker was one of the first leaders in Illinois to point out that COVID-19 has affected African American families more than any other population in the nation. This DCFS order disproportionately affects African Americans, causing more children to be separated from their biological parents and siblings, aggravating an already tragic and dire crisis in the community. The order serves to worsen the fabric of economically depressed and medically underserved African American communities.

Denying family contact is a horrible misplaced priority that should not be part of our state’s policy. Included in permissible activities during Pritzker’s stay-at-home order are playing golf, purchasing cannabis, getting take-out food and going to a hardware store, yet poor families are banned from visiting their children. This is not acceptable.

Supervised visits can be done in a safe way, like all the other acceptable activities permitted during the shelter-in-place order. If we can safely prepare and distribute food, we can safely allow parents and their children to visit one another.

Whenever a crisis hits, it is the most vulnerable among us that are hit the hardest. It doesn’t have to be that way.

Results were based from about 5,600 completed records from employees of 26 clubs. Samples were obtained on April 14 and 15.

“It allows us to get a peek of the nation-wide prevalence,” said Dr. Jay Bhattacharya at Stanford, one the study’s leaders, said Sunday.

The start of the baseball season has been delayed because of the virus outbreak. There’s no timetable for when the season might begin.

Sixty people tested positive in the raw data, and adjustments were made for false positives and false negatives. Bhattacharya said the survey had a 0.5% false positive rate.

Antibodies are produced by a person’s immune system if they have been infected by a virus.

MLB employees have been less affected than their surrounding communities have been, Bhattacharya said.

The University of Southern California and the Sports Medicine Research and Testing Laboratory in Salt Lake City also led the study.

Data for players was not broken out. The study was not representative of the overall population, given 95% of the participants were under 65 and few reported comorbidities.

MLB team doctors looked at results last month. The goal of the study was to better determine how widespread COVID-19 is, which could aid governments and health professionals in their evaluation of when to lift stay-at-home orders.

The Chicago Cubs, Cincinnati, Colorado and Miami did not participate, Bhattacharya said.

“The MLB population is a special population. They’re not representative of every city that they’re in,” Bhattacharya said. “They also are more well to do than a typical population, so it’s not representative. ... They have an organization that allows us to sample in just two days time in so many places all at once. And that’s unique.”

“I don’t get the sense that they are doing it to benefit them,” Bhattacharya said. “If the economy opens up, sports are huge gatherings. So in a sense it benefits everybody. I actually think they’re doing it because they want to contribute to public health knowledge.”

Each club was given approximately 350 tests.

“To be able to have a window into how widespread the epidemic is in so many places all at once is a really special thing,” Bhattacharya said.

Updated at 10:06 p.m. ET

The IRS has paid out more than $207 billion in coronavirus relief payments to individual taxpayers, as part of the $2 trillion package passed by Congress known as the CARES Act.

And among the recipients of those $1,200 payments are the bank accounts of dead individuals — a problem that could impact millions of American families.

Bob L'Hommedieu's father passed away in December after a long battle with dementia. So L'Hommedieu notified the Veterans Administration and the Social Security Administration that his father had passed, and payments from those agencies were halted. But on April 15, he noticed a payment in the amount of $1,200 in his late father's account.

It was a coronavirus relief payment from the IRS.

""I feel bad that this money is sitting in my dad's account,"" says L'Hommedieu, who lives in Houston. ""I don't know what to do with it. And there are people out there that need it badly.""

""And, you know, that bothers me. Quite a bit. I wish I knew what to do with it, but, you know, I don't,"" he added.

L'Hommedieu reached out to his two senators in Texas. One sent a form letter that didn't answer his questions. The other told him to contact the IRS. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told The Wall Street Journal one week ago that heirs should return the money sent to deceased individuals. But people who talked to NPR said they had more questions than answers.

""There's mass confusion,"" said Janet Holtzblatt, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. ""There's been no official guidance as to how, in this instance, people should return the money that was received for their loved ones.""

The IRS did not answer questions about the payments, but the scope of the problem has the potential to be vast. The CDC estimates that 2.8 million Americans died in 2018, for example. And there are signs that people who died more than two years ago have received payments.

Karen McClure, of Fort Collins, Colo., says her mother passed away in January 2018. But in April of this year, her late mother's bank account received a payment of $1,200.

McClure said she reached out to her local congressman but hasn't heard back.

""The government is being very reactive instead of proactive to this situation — which I find frustrating,"" she says.

Mark Everson, who served as IRS commissioner from 2003 to 2007, says that the IRS has generally been doing a good job, ""but there's a real trade-off of speed versus accuracy in the processing,"" he says. ""There's a lot of pressure to move quickly, and in the past Treasury and the IRS have been criticized because they haven't moved quickly enough.""

Everson says that people in this situation should rely on official guidance from IRS.gov.

Teresa Wilmot, 71, has been trying to do just that. The Rockford, Ill., resident lost her partner of 39 years, Frank Dajka, just two months ago. Last month, she noticed a payment in his account.

""I'm coping with [the] Frank stuff pretty well at this point. I'm not over it. I probably will never be over it,"" she says. ""But that part didn't bother me. I'm probably angrier at the government for sending out a payment to somebody who's deceased.""

Wilmot has been trying without success to find guidance online from the IRS to send the money back.

""I went online to the address on the letter and looked for a long time trying to find some way that I could first send the payment back. And I couldn't find that,"" she says. ""So I look for a way to contact somebody at the IRS or the Treasury or whatever to return the payment. And I couldn't find that.""

After multiple requests, the IRS declined to answer questions and directed them to the Treasury Department.

Wednesday morning, after this story first published, the Treasury Department told NPR that payments made to people who died before the payment was received should be returned to the IRS, and it published instructions on its website.

To understand why, we broke down census, labor, and healthcare data between the two New York City boroughs.

We found that COVID-19 is not the great equalizer.

While Manhattan, on average, has higher incomes and better access to healthcare, the Bronx is up against generations of food deserts, income inequality, crumbling public housing, and poor clinical care. Plus, more frontline workers and subway riders are coming from the Bronx right now.

With 50% more Latino and black residents in the Bronx than Manhattan, you begin to see why being a person of color living in the Bronx makes COVID-19 two times deadlier.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Following is a transcript of the video.



Narrator: Why is COVID-19 hitting some communities harder than others? And who exactly has been hit hardest? We're seeing this happen across the country. But to better understand the divide, we zeroed in on two New York City boroughs: The Bronx and Manhattan.

Even though Manhattan has more people, The Bronx has more cases and more deaths. We wanted to understand the reasons for this gap, so we compared the boroughs based on three criteria: why more people are getting infected, being hospitalized, and dying from COVID-19. And it's revealed this pandemic is attacking two very different Americas. Let's look at why there's a difference in infection numbers between the two boroughs. We'll start with income.

The Bronx is the poorest borough in the city, with a median income of $38,000, compared to Manhattan's $82,000. Almost 60% of people in the Bronx are paying more than they can afford for housing, which has led to more multigenerational housing in the Bronx and more residents in public housing than any other borough. For every apartment in the Bronx, there are 2.8 people living in it. Compare that to the two people living in every apartment in Manhattan. More people at home likely means more people get sick.

Overall, there's 350,000 more housing units in Manhattan than the Bronx, and better-quality housing. See this map? Most residents in the Bronx are dealing with maintenance problems, like leaks, rats, cracks, plumbing, and broken toilets. These issues alone make it more challenging to live at home, not to mention having to work from home because of COVID-19. That is, if you can work from home.

According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, of those Americans making less than $33,000 a year, which are these neighborhoods in the Bronx, 9% of people could work from home. Whereas of those people making more than $79,000 a year, all of these neighborhoods in Manhattan, 60% could work from home. On the other hand, in the Bronx, residents who can't work from home are most likely out of a job and tight on money, or they're essential workers.

Think grocery-store clerks, transit employees, trash collectors, healthcare workers, many of those people you see daily out on the front lines. 17% of frontline workers in New York City are coming from the Bronx, while just 12% are from Manhattan. And for the majority of these essential workers, getting to their job means taking the subway. Subway ridership has dropped across the city, but not by the same amount. In Manhattan, 75% fewer people are riding, but in the Bronx, ridership has dropped only 55%. So trains to and from the Bronx can be packed, especially with reduced subway services. Plus, people from the Bronx face longer commutes than people in Manhattan. On average, 12.7 minutes longer of standing body to body with that person who's maybe coughing.

OK, let's move on to the second criterion. Let's say someone in each borough does get the virus. What will influence whether they become hospitalized? The Bronx has had over 10,000 hospitalizations. Manhattan? About 6,000. Every year, New York counties are ranked based on their health. Last year, Manhattan was sixth best in the state. The Bronx? Dead last, out of 62 counties. This is based on things like access to clinical care, the environment, and preexisting conditions.

The Bronx has higher rates of preexisting conditions like asthma, heart disease, and obesity, conditions that increase the risk of a severe COVID-19 case. To explain why this is, we're gonna have to go deep. We'll start with obesity rates between the two boroughs. Studies have shown that poor diets and lack of exercise are linked to obesity. And in the Bronx, families facing money problems or limited time are forced to turn to cheaper, prepackaged foods. 87% of kids in the Bronx rely on free or reduced school lunches, which are packed with salt and fat. Plus, the Bronx has almost double the amount of food stamps per individual compared to Manhattan.

But the greatest contributor to diet, though, is access. And the Bronx has historically had some of the worst food deserts in the country, where it's hard to find affordable and healthy food close to home. All of these factors have created a lack of healthy resources for generations in the Bronx. They lead to unhealthy eating habits and high rates of obesity and diabetes, both preexisting conditions that increase your risk of death from COVID-19. On the other hand, in Manhattan, life expectancy and access to healthy food is much higher. People not only have more access to grocery stores, they also have more gyms to choose from. Simply put, these things and disposable income make it a lot easier to be healthier here.

Another preexisting condition that skyrockets risk of COVID-19 hospitalization: asthma. In big cities, studies have shown pollution is a major cause of asthma. Pollution is bad across New York City, but the Bronx has the highest rates of asthma-related emergency-room visits. There's even a place nicknamed Asthma Alley in the South Bronx. It's surrounded by four highways and sanitation and sewage facilities. There's also a bunch of trucks coming and going from all of these distribution centers, these food wholesalers, and the FreshDirect distribution center here and the Wall Street Journal and New York Post printing press here. At last count, asthma hospitalizations were 27 times higher in this area than the rest of the city. Bad asthma equals a higher risk of being hospitalized with COVID-19 and needing a ventilator to help you breathe. But it gets worse when you take into account how accessible medical professionals are in these areas.

In Manhattan, there's one physician for every 750 people. In the Bronx, there's one physician for every 1,770 people. There are also fewer hospital beds in the Bronx. Manhattan has almost double the amount of hospitals for only a 15% larger population. That brings us to our third and final criterion. Why are more people dying due to COVID-19 in the Bronx? In Manhattan, four emergency hospitals were constructed to combat coronavirus. While the Bronx was promised one, the borough hasn't gotten it yet. Quality care also isn't as accessible in the Bronx. On average, Manhattan hospitals received three out of five stars. Bronx hospitals received 1.2 out of five stars. Jacobi Hospital in the Bronx is one of the five worst-rated hospitals in the nation.

Add in the effect of preexisting conditions we talked about earlier, and the Bronx has had 2,800 deaths of people with underlying conditions. Manhattan? Almost 1,300. Altogether, as of May 10, Manhattan's death toll was 1,946, while the Bronx hit 3,177 deaths. And when you break down New York City's death toll, people of color are two times more likely to die of coronavirus. In the Bronx, the population is 85% black or Hispanic. Whereas in Manhattan, 64% of the population is white. This is why you're seeing headlines that a disproportionate number of people of color are dying of COVID-19. But these deaths go beyond coronavirus.

For the Bronx, cycles of income inequality, food deserts, poor healthcare, fewer hospitals, and crumbling housing have harmed communities of color for generations. And we see this pattern repeat itself again and again with black and brown communities across the country. Baltimore, Detroit, Chicago, St. Louis, Los Angeles. This disease is not the great equalizer. Yes, anyone can get COVID-19. But not everyone is as vulnerable to dying from it. That has everything to do with the problems in place long before this ever started.",real

Bright filed a whistleblower complaint charging the Trump administration with failing to heed his calls for preparation and then ending his role as head of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority. He speaks to Norah O'Donnell in his first interview since his removal from BARDA for a 60 Minutes report to be broadcast this Sunday.

In an excerpt from the interview that appeared on the CBS Evening News, O'Donnell notes that Bright says in his complaint that HHS Secretary Alex Azar was intent on downplaying the catastrophic threat.

""Why would he do that?"" O'Donnell asked Bright.

""You know, I don't know why he would do that,"" Bright said.

President Trump was also downplaying the threat. He said at an event in Michigan on January 30, ""We think we have it very well under control. We have very little problem in this country at this moment.""

""Remember, the entire leadership was focused on containment,"" Bright told O'Donnell. ""There was a belief that we could contain this virus and keep it out of the United States. Containment doesn't work. Containment does buy time. It could slow. It very well could slow the spread. But while you're slowing the spread, you better be doing something in parallel to be prepared for when that virus breaks out. That was my job.""

The Department of Health and Human Services has said that it strongly disagrees with the claims in Bright's complaint and Secretary Azar said, ""his allegations do not hold water.""

The Minneapolis-based retailer announced Wednesday that its Drive Up curbside pickup, in-store pickup and Shipt delivery grew by 278% in the three-month quarter, which ended May 2. The company said comparable sales, which included online purchases, increased 10.8% for the quarter.

""Throughout the first quarter, our team and guests faced unprecedented challenges arising from the spread of COVID-19,"" Target chairman and CEO Brian Cornell said in a news release. ""In the face of those challenges, our team showed extraordinary resilience as guests relied on Target as a trusted resource for their families.""

Digital sales accelerated every month in the quarter and went from 33% in February to 282% in April compared to sales in the same time period last year, Target said, noting 80% of online orders were shipped from stores.

Cornell said during an earnings call that as shelter-in-place rules were adopted across the country, shoppers began to pull back on in-store shopping and the company saw a dramatic surge in digital traffic and sales.

“We also began seeing higher demand for products oriented around staying at home, including home office products, video games, puzzles, and board games, along with the housewares and kitchenware,” Cornell said.

Target reported revenue of $19.62 billion, up 11.3% over the same period a year ago. Net income fell 64% to $284 million.

The company did report higher expenses due to COVID-19 including employee wages and benefits.

Target announced Monday that it was extending the $2 an hour temporary wage increase for employees through July 4, which is two months longer than originally announced. The company is also continuing to offer access to a paid leave program for workers most susceptible to the coronavirus through the end of June.

Target also extended the two initiatives in April and officials have said the company is spending $500 million in temporary benefits, wages and bonuses for workers.

Shares of Target stock were down more than 2% as of 10:45 a.m. Wednesday.

Kane, the Islanders’ Mathew Barzal and the Jets’ Mark Scheifele spent 45 minutes on a video conference call Monday laughing and poking fun at each other through entertaining pick-’em and trivia games.

Whom would Kane want with him in a three-on-three game, excluding Hawks teammates? The Maple Leafs’ Auston Matthews and the Kings’ Drew Doughty.

Whom would he not want to face on a breakaway? The Canadiens’ Carey Price or the Lightning’s Andrei Vasilevskiy.

Whom would he want with him on a two-on-one? The Rangers’ Artemi Panarin.

‘‘That was probably the funnest hockey I’ve ever played,’’ Kane added to his Panarin answer, providing a quote that instantly went viral on Twitter.

Sure, Kane might be stuck inside his Chicago condominium. And, sure, he has been watching NBC Sports Chicago’s replays of the Hawks’ 2010 Stanley Cup run and playing Xbox video games for the first time in years. But those time-fillers don’t compare to the excitement of live hockey. (The Pilates studio in his building — his temporary training center — isn’t exactly the same as Fifth Third Arena, either.)

Just like the rest of society, however, he’s finding a way to make the most of the downtime. As a result, the conference call was as entertaining as a period of preseason hockey.

It turns out the same can be said for much of the rest of the NHL. In fact, the league-run calls that have sprung up by the dozens in recent weeks — Hawks captain Jonathan Toews’ appearance March 31 turned out to be only the tip of the iceberg — have provided more insight into players’ daily lives, hobbies and personalities than a normal season does.

The calls rarely have been newsworthy — Doughty did drop a relative bombshell on another call Monday, when he said he doesn’t see how the season is going to return — but they have been lively, playful and thoroughly engrossing, representing a huge difference from typical locker-room interviews.

The best part of Toews’ call came when he and the Blues’ Alex Pietrangelo meandered into discussing old-school montages of NHL hits on YouTube. Kane’s call had even more laugh-out-loud moments, such as when Barzal forgot which college Islanders general manager Lou Lamoriello led to the 1983 Frozen Four.

‘‘Those contract negotiations just got a little bit tougher,’’ Kane quipped.

Once the coronavirus pandemic ends and hockey returns, the calls inevitably will fade from the NHL’s media procedures. But the league, which long has fostered an atmosphere that discourages players from speaking out about personal thoughts and passions, would be wise to learn from the calls’ popularity.

The NBA’s culture of individualism has translated perfectly to the 21st-century sports world, especially its social-media component. The NHL’s culture of always-team-first homogeneity hasn’t, for better or worse.

But it’s clear the stars of the NHL can juggle showing their human side and representing their team. Kane didn’t compromise any of his talent, mystique or respect by joking around on the call, but he did make himself seem like more of a real person.

If one silver lining of the shutdown proves to be a greater emphasis on candid, lighthearted discussion among the NHL’s biggest names in future seasons, the league might emerge from the pandemic in a better place than it entered it.",real

Oprah Winfrey is giving grants to the cities she’s called home through her $12 million coronavirus relief fund.

She announced Wednesday that her Oprah Winfrey Charitable Foundation will donate money to organizations dedicated to helping underserved communities in Chicago; Baltimore; Nashville, Tennessee; Milwaukee; and Kosciusko, Mississippi, where she was born.

“The reason I’m talking about it is because there is going to be a need for people of means to step up,” Winfrey said in an interview with The Associated Press. “I mean, this thing is not going away. Even when the virus is gone, the devastation left by people not being able to work for months who were holding on paycheck to paycheck, who have used up their savings — people are going to be in need. So my thing is, look in your own neighborhood, in your own backyard to see how you can serve and where your service is most essential. That is the real essential work, I think, for people of means.”

After speaking with Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot and other leaders, Winfrey decided to give $5 million to Live Healthy Chicago, which provides immediate support to seniors and high-risk residents affected by the coronavirus.

In Nashville, where Winfrey lived with her father and started her media career, she is giving $2 million to NashvilleNurtures, a collaboration with Mount Zion Baptist Church and Tennessee State University, Winfrey’s alma mater. They plan to feed 10,000 families in and around the city.

In Milwaukee, where she lived with her mother, Winfrey is assisting those in need of housing and mental health care with a $100,000 donation to SaintA and The Nia Imani Family, Inc.

In Baltimore, where Winfrey also built her media career, she’s donating money to Living Classrooms Foundation and Center for Urban Families.

She will also give $115,000 to the Boys and Girls Club of East Mississippi.

“I’m not opposed to big organizations dispersing money, but I always like to do the on-the-ground grassroots stuff myself,” she said. “Look, I want to be able to reach people who have been incarcerated and are coming out of prison. I want to reach mothers of domestic violence. I want to reach people. I want to feed people. I want to help people get access to testing.”

Winfrey said she’s been homebound since March 11, four days after she wrapped her nine-city wellness tour that visited arenas like Barclays Center in Brooklyn and the Forum in Inglewood, California.

She announced her COVID-19 Relief Fund last month, initially giving $1 million to America’s Food Fund. She said Wednesday that she will also give grants to advocacy organization Global Citizen, New Mount Pilgrim Missionary Baptist Church in Chicago and Minnie’s Food Pantry in Plano, Texas, among other organizations.

Before giving out millions to others, Winfrey said she first helped the people closest to her.

“The first thing I did was start in my own family, people I knew who were going to be touched and were not going to have jobs. Then I moved out to people who I’ve worked with and known who maybe would be out of work. I started literally here, working my way out, and then into the community. So people who I hadn’t spoken to in years ended up getting checks from me like, ‘What is this?’/p>

“All the cousins and some aunties — try to help your own family first,” she added. “I didn’t want an announcement about, ‘I’m going out into the world trying to help other people’ and then your own family saying, ‘Hey, I can’t pay my light bill. I can’t pay my rent.’”

Last week, Winfrey gave a commencement speech during Facebook’s virtual “Graduation 2020” event, and asked the graduates, “What will your essential service be?” She said she’s asked herself the same question.

“What this pandemic has done is made me think about giving differently. How I give and who’s on the receiving end of that, and how do you do that in such a way that sustains people? I’ve ultimately always believed that you teach people to fish ... but sometimes people just need fish and a piece of bread,” she said. “Sometimes you need some fish, OK? Sometimes you don’t have time to learn to fish. I just need some fish today!”",real
1394,https://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2020/05/media_in_panic_mode_over_latest_presidential_polls.html,2020-05-19,Media in Panic Mode over Latest Presidential Polls,"CNN, in their dogged and unending quest to overturn the 2016 presidential election and drive President Trump from office, is in full-on campaign mode. Just as in the last presidential election cycle, opinion polls are a campaign staple of the media and the Democrat party. Polls are not being used as they should, to reflect public opinion, but instead to shape opinion, a form of political propaganda.

CNN commissioned a poll, the results of which were released last week, conducted by SSRS, “an independent research company.” A CNN poll doesn’t mean Brian Stelter and Jim Acosta, also known as dumb and dumber, were on a street corner asking passersby how much they hated the Orange Man.

When CNN reported the poll results, their headline put a ho-hum spin on the poll findings, “Biden tops Trump nationwide, but battlegrounds tilt Trump.” Townhall reported the poll more accurately, “New CNN poll shows Trump crushing Biden in swing states.”

How illustrative that the same poll with the same results was presented so differently, Trump “crushing” in one headline while in another headline results simply “tilt.” In fact, CNN buried the poll results on their homepage as they didn’t like the results. I can’t blame them as it doesn’t fit the CNN narrative.

YouTube screen grab

Polls are designed to reflect the opinions of a group of people at a moment in time. A small sample of individuals are asked for their opinion regarding a particular issue and this small sample is hoped to be representative of the larger population. Otherwise the axiom of garbage in, garbage out applies.

The poll sample is important. Oversampling Democrats will skew the results in favor of the Democrat candidate. In this poll, “34 percent described themselves as Democrats, 26 percent described themselves as Republicans”, an 8-point difference. Imagine the results if those percentages were flipped, oversampling Republicans by 8 points.

The CNN poll also surveyed registered, not likely, voters. Since only slightly more than half of eligible voters actually voted in the 2016 presidential election, this, too, is not a representative sample of the electorate.

The CNN poll, with Democrat oversampling, showed voters nationally backing Biden over Trump by 51 to 46 percent, a five point difference, less than the 8 point difference in party affiliation. Theoretically, if the survey sample were equally balanced between Democrats and Republicans, Trump would come out ahead by 3 points. Which is perhaps why Democrats were oversampled.

Is a nationwide poll even relevant in a presidential election? Not really, because of the Electoral College. Instead there are 50 state elections taking place, not a national popular vote, much to the consternation of the political left.

Rather than a popular vote, the presidential election is decided by a handful of “battleground states” that tend to swing red or blue, depending on the electoral cycle. An opinion poll in New York or California is irrelevant as it’s a foregone conclusion that the Democrat will win those states. The margin doesn’t matter as the electoral votes will be the same.

In battleground states, Trump leads Biden by 52 to 45 percent, a 7-point margin. Add the 8-point difference in party affiliation of those polled and Trump’s lead could potentially be 15 percent. Is it any wonder CNN is not touting this news?

This poll has other interesting tidbits. The “economy, stupid” typically predicts the next president, as USA Today notes. The US economy is on life support these days with the Wuhan coronavirus causing a national economic shutdown. But as the Washington Post begrudgingly admits, “Americans have an increasingly dismal view of the economy, but they don’t blame Trump.” Really? Democrats and the media exclusively blame Trump.

A YouGov poll finds similar results, “One-third of Americans blame the Trump Administration for unemployment numbers.” A more honest headline would be that two thirds of Americans don’t blame Trump for the current economic mess.

In the CNN poll, Trump holds a 12-point lead over Biden when the survey asked, “Who they trusted most to handle the economy.” And that’s up from only a 4-point margin last month.

Sharpness and stamina also favor Trump by 49 to 46 percent. I suspect that margin is much higher, as Trump holds daily briefings, sparing with a hostile media for well over an hour while Biden can’t muddle through a fawning 5-minute interview from his basement with notes and a teleprompter, without losing his train of thought or saying something stupid.

Rasmussen, the most accurate pollster in the 2016 presidential election, offers another perspective. They survey likely voters, rather than simply registered or eligible voters. In their Daily Presidential Tracking Poll, President Trump, on May 15, had a 49 percent total approval rating, compared to 47 percent approval for President Obama exactly eight years ago.

Gallup, no fan of President Trump, echoes Rasmussen.

Despite a wave of critical news coverage and Democratic catcalls, President Trump sits at his “highest” approval in the latest Gallup survey, and above where four of the last six presidents, including Barack Obama and George W. Bush, were at this point of the first term.

Two separate polls both pointing out the inconvenient truth that Trump is more popular than “The One,” Barack Hussein Obama. Wait until Barr and Durham unleash the hounds of hell on the ObamaGate conspirators and watch Obama’s popularity drop like an anchor.

Trump is dealing with an economic calamity the likes not seen since the Great Depression. The Beltway deep state is still trying to overturn the last election and remove him from office. The media is almost universally hostile and nasty toward Trump. Compare that to Obama, cruising to reelection against the hapless Mitt Romney, fanned on by an adoring media with virtually no Republican opposition. Yet Trump has higher approval ratings than Obama.

Remember that polls are a snapshot in time, with the only poll that matters being on Election Day. How wrong were the polls in 2016, predicting a Clinton landslide?

On Election Day, November 8, 2016, Frank Luntz, noted pollster and political pundit tweeted, “In case I wasn't clear enough from my previous tweets: Hillary Clinton will be the next President of the United States.” Some prediction.

Take opinion polls with a grain of salt. Note who was surveyed and how the results are spun. The truth is right in front of you.

The very genetic code of the planet’s biosphere is being overwritten; The ultimate goal being the ability to manipulate, patent and program at will the biological processes of all life.

Tom Knight, professor at MIT’s Artificial Intelligence Lab, said in 2007 that “The genetic code is 3.6 billion years old. It’s time for a rewrite.”

In 2013, Fidelity Investments published a video outlining the future of synthetic biology:

Thinking Big: Synthetic Biology, Fidelity from Tian Hughes on Vimeo.

Synthetic biology, according to a 2005 European Commission paper is “…the engineering of biology… the synthesis of complex, biologically based (or inspired) systems which display functions that do not exist in nature.”

Geneticist Craig Venter is a pioneer in the field of synthetic biology. In 2010 the media hailed his team’s success in creating “the first self-replicating species we’ve had on the planet whose parent is a computer.”

Venter and Google teamed up at secretive gathering that hosted Jeffery Epstein

The Edge Billionaire dinner – comparable to the secretive Bilderberg group – is an annual gathering of tech elites that has hosted Jeffery Epstein, Craig Venter, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Larry Page, Bill Joy and many others.

Physicist Freeman Dyson described the individuals leading this group as having god-like power to create entirely new species on earth in a “New Age of Wonder”. He describes them as:

“…a new generation of artists, writing genomes as fluently as Blake and Byron wrote verses, might create an abundance of new flowers and fruit and trees and birds to enrich the ecology of our planet.”

As revealed in the 2005 book “The Google Story“, Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin met with Craig Venter – credited with creating synthetic life – at the Edge Billionaires meeting.

Also present were representatives from the U.S. State Department, Bill Gates, Anne Wojcicki, Bill Joy and dozens of other tech company CEO’s and scientists. The authors write, “Not long after the dinner in California, Brin and Page teamed up with Venter. The biologist gained access to Google’s immense computing power and personnel.”

Coronavirus vaccine to use synthetic DNA created by computers

The New York Times reported on the developing vaccine technology in 2015. As the Times reported, animal tests on the synthetic DNA vaccine “are essentially re-engineering the animals to resist disease.”

Now, research-backed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation will use genetic code created by computers in a potential coronavirus vaccine.

As reported, the Gates-funded synthetic biologists believe that they can “do better” than nature with self-assembling nanoparticles that will be injected into your body:

“With all due respect to nature, synthetic biologists believe they can do better. Using computers, they are designing new, self-assembling protein nanoparticles studded with viral proteins, called antigens: these porcupine-like particles would be the guts of a vaccine.”

The illness, called ""multi-system inflammatory syndrome,"" is similar to toxic shock syndrome, requires intensive care and is sometimes fatal.

Symptoms include a rash, heart problems, problems with blood coagulation, or acute vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has released a medical brief warning doctors about a newly-recognized condition linked to the coronavirus that affects children and adolescents.

Known as ""multisystem inflammatory syndrome,"" the illness has reportedly caused organ failure and shock in children and adolescents and testing suggests it's related to COVID-19.

Preliminary case reports have defined the illness in those aged 0-19 who may have been exposed to coronavirus. Symptoms include rash, high fever for more than 3 days, fatigue and confusion, vomiting, stomach pain, and/or diarrhea.

Other researchers have proposed the name ""Pediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome Temporarily Associated with SARS-CoV-2,"" or PIMS-TS for short, to describe the new condition.

Medical workers are urged to submit any relevant case data online to help doctors and researchers better identify and understand the illness, determine what causes it, and develop treatments.

The brief, released May 15, follows a similar announcement from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also calling for medical workers to report any symptoms of the inflammatory syndrome to help add to the limited data available.

The WHO has also noted that symptoms of this newly-identified syndrome are similar to Kawasaki disease, a rare disease that affects children under 5 years old, causing inflammation in the arterial walls.

Although much is still unknown about the syndrome, it's still believed to be rare even in children exposed to coronavirus — at least 100 children worldwide have been recently been diagnosed with the illness, Business Insider previously reported.

In New York City, 38 children have been diagnosed with PIMS-TS and three have died.

It's unclear if this particular illness also affects adults.

Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has been voted the UK’s ‘most impressive’ politician according to a recent poll. The survey, carried out by Press Gazette, asked 2700 people who they thought was doing best at handling the current crisis. Sturgeon came out top, with 29% of the vote, ahead of Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Labour opposition leader Keir Starmer. The poll follows on from a recent Scottish Government survey which gave Nicola Sturgeon a rating of 84% for her slow and measured approach to lockdown. For in defiance of Westminster’s lifting of lockdown restrictions earlier this month, Scotland has until now kept them in place, only hinting recently that some may be lifted on 28th May.

The statistics regarding Sturgeon’s performance will not come as a surprise to many, given the contrast with her Westminster counterpart. Boris Johnson has faced a barrage of criticism in recent weeks over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic in Britain. And with the highest death rate in Europe, and second highest death toll in the world, it’s no surprise that questions are being raised. Yet the PM has of late, not provided the consistent, strong leadership required at this time. In contrast to his Scottish counterpart, who gives a daily briefing on the Covid-19 situation in Scotland, without fail; Boris Johnson has not given a press conference for days, and has not been seen in public for days, prompting #WhereisBoris to trend on Twitter. The difference between the two leaders could not be greater; every time Boris puts a foot wrong, it boosts Sturgeon, and the case for Scottish independence.

Unlike the Scottish government, which has yet to make any change to the current social distancing guidelines, other than being able to leave home now twice a day for exercise – instead of once as previously stated – Boris Johnson announced last week that people from different households could now meet; that if required, workers could return to work, and that from 1st June some shops would reopen and some pupils would return to school. The messaging also changed – rather confusingly, from ‘Stay Home’ to ‘Stay Alert’ – with no-one quite clear as to what the latter actually means. The motivation for beginning to lift lockdown measures is no doubt, mainly, economic, with experts warning that the UK is headed for a recession like no other. But there are concerns that Johnson has acted too soon, as with the death toll rising to the virus every day, we could be faced with another ‘peak’ if we return to normality too soon.

For the reality is the virus is still with us, and is likely to remain with us for years to come. Boris Johnson himself gave the example of SARS, for which, he highlighted, a vaccine has not been found in the last 18 years. Although scientists across the globe are working tirelessly in a bid to discover a vaccine as soon as possible, there are no guarantees that they will succeed in the short term. The key in the meantime, will be testing – both for those infected with coronavirus and for immunity, with antibody testing. But the UK government has only recently started to take testing seriously. Early on in the pandemic it downplayed the importance of it, favouring ‘herd immunity ’instead. This was in contrast to countries like China and South Korea that saw testing as a vital way of managing the crisis. Back then, Britain’s Chief Scientific Advisor, Sir Patrick Vallance, said ‘We think this virus is likely to be one that comes year on year, becomes like a seasonal virus. Communities will become immune to it and that’s going to be an important part of controlling this longer term. About 60% is the sort of figure you need to get herd immunity’. Britain has paid dearly for this ‘laissez-faire approach.

The case against the UK government is building by the day. Aside from the overall death toll of 35, 341, it has been established that an additional 23,000 deaths took place this year in care homes. Far from putting a ‘protective ring’ around care homes as Health Minister Matt Hancock has said, the government has been accused of putting a ‘noose’ around them, with elderly patients effectively like sitting ducks in the wake of the pandemic. It has been observed that no real attempts were made to prevent the spread of coronavirus throughout Britain’s nursing homes, with patients regularly admitted into homes from hospital, without being tested for the virus. Recently it was even reported that Personal Protective Equipment originally intended for care homes was diverted to NHS hospitals. Justice Secretary Robert Buckland admitted on Wednesday that : “We needed to make a choice about testing, we did decide to focus upon the NHS.’

Choices indeed have been made. And increasingly, questions are being raised as to whether the right decisions have been taken – both before and during the pandemic. For at a time when the country is ‘clapping for carers’ every week, in a display of public support for NHS staff, the government is passing its immigration bill, targeting the very migrants who play such an important role in Britain’s health service. As MP Valerie Vaz put it: ‘With this immigration bill the government is effectively clapping them out of the country’. Indeed the harsh reality of Tory policy cannot be escaped during this pandemic. The under-funding of public services over the years, particularly the NHS, primarily by the Conservative government is manifesting itself during this crisis like at no other time. We have entered an era where capitalism is under more strain than ever, where the only solution to this crisis comes from state interference – with the transport industry to care homes to universities all set to require substantial financial aid to survive. A different Britain will emerge from the pandemic.

As for Scotland, it must decide whether it wants to continue being at the receiving end of Tory policies which favour business over people, or whether it will finally carve out for itself a fairer society with welfare at the fore. With a resurgence of coronavirus potentially looming on the horizon, I know which society I’d prefer to live in…

Weary of more than two months of lockdowns, lost jobs, vanished income, and emotional distress, Americans are practicing a bit of Irish Democracy, shopping, dining out, gathering, and trying to carry on as before the pandemic arrived without approval from authorities. It was bound to happen.

As has been widely noted, we were initially told that we needed to shut down and shelter in place so that we would “flatten the curve” of infection growth to prevent the health care system from being overwhelmed by people sick with COVID-19. That benchmark was met a little more than a month into the lockdowns. Time magazine reported in late April that “The U.S. Has Flattened the Curve.” This New York Times chart clearly shows that the flattening began early last month.

Yet many Americans are still under shelter-in-place orders, some of which have been extended. We hate to use a cliche, but politicians have been moving the goalposts. Flattening the curve isn’t good enough. They want to keep people home until there’s a vaccine; or science, which has sadly become a loose term that means whatever the user wants it to, has established an effective treatment; or maybe until there are zero coronavirus cases.

This has rankled more than a few. The masses are fed up with huddling in their homes and are yearning to breathe free.

The center of the “resistance” might be, oddly enough, in California, which has three “Free Counties.” Sutter and Yuba, just north of Sacramento, and Modoc, in the state’s far northeast corner, have reopened without Gov. Gavin Newsom’s approval. More counties quickly followed, rushing, reports the Sacramento Bee, “to persuade state health officials they are ready to reopen key segments of their local economies on a fast-track basis.”

In Southern California, Orange County engaged Newsom in a bitter battle over reopening beaches there. Newsom closed the shoreline when he saw photos that he didn’t like of people on the sand in Newport Beach. County Supervisor Michelle Steel called it an “act of retribution against Orange County.” But beachgoers eventually won by kicking up such a fuss that Newsom and state authorities were pressured into making a decision they otherwise would not have made.

Meanwhile, Michiganders are chafing under the boot of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who has issued arguably the harshest lockdown orders in the country, and has even extended to May 28 her initial closure order for some businesses. The capital in Lansing has been the site of demonstrations by some deeply restless, and in many cases angry, protesters.

“We haven’t had any bloodshed yet,” one member of a Facebook group called Michiganders Against Excessive Quarantine recently wrote.

We hope there is none. But tempers are short. One man has already been charged with making death threats against Whitmer and the state attorney general. And we’ve seen members of the Michigan Militia swear they aren’t going to allow law enforcement to arrest an Owosso barber who reopened his business because he had no other income. How long can she hold back demands for freedom — in America?

Other developments include:

Palm Beach County, Florida, reopened before it had met federal guidelines, according to a weekend story in the Florida Sun-Sentinel.

“Lockdown-weary New Yorkers ditched the distancing to get social instead this weekend — transforming parts of the Big Apple into a raucous, late-season Mardi Gras,” the New York Post reported last week.

The Wisconsin Supreme Court has struck down Gov. Tony Evers’ orders, immediately lifting “all restrictions on businesses and gatherings imposed by the administration’s order” while keeping “in place the closure of schools until fall.” The suit was filed by the Republican leadership in the Wisconsin Legislature.

A group has filed a lawsuit against New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and the attorney general for using the “pandemic as an excuse to revoke a long list of natural rights” guaranteed by the Constitution, and “recognized in the Declaration of Independence.”

Stephen Kruiser, who writes PJMedia’s Morning Briefing, suggested Monday that the lockdown governors need to be locked up. “The ‘never let a crisis go to waste’ crowd continues to overplay its hand, which is why this would be the perfect time to begin some real push-back against them,” he writes. They “need to be reined in for the financial well-being of the people whose lives they’re ruining.”

Law enforcement officers showed up Monday at a New Jersey gym that opened without permission. One of the officers read a notice informing the members they were in violation of the governor’s orders. He then said “on that note, have a good day. Everybody be safe,” before turning and walking away.

A few days after Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf said that counties and businesses that plan to reopen without state approval were committing a “cowardly act,” protesters rallied on the capitol steps in Harrisburg, chanting “open us up” and “let us work.”

Other protests have been seen on Long Island, and in Sacramento; Annapolis; Washington, D.C.; North Carolina, Rhode Island, Ohio, Minnesota, and Livermore, California.

The control that politicians and unelected bureaucrats who are advising them have been exerting is clearly slipping away, and they are facing a choice: They can work with the people who feel suffocated and expeditiously restore as much normalcy as possible, or they can remain on their present course, which increases the chances there’ll be violence because either a protester or someone in a security line will make a poor decision of out anger or fear, and then pay the price on Election Day.

As Adm. Josh Painter said in “The Hunt For Red October,” “this business will get out of control. It will get out of control and we’ll be lucky to live through it.” There is that much raw emotion out there.

Coronavirus will change the healthcare industry forever, and we must be there for nurses in the aftermath.

Nurses have banded together to develop a successful COVID-19 playbook to effectively combat it on the frontlines.

But with that will come long-term health impacts, and we should establish wellness opportunities to assist their recovery.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

There are defining moments in all of our lives — moments that have the ability to fundamentally alter a person, process, and organization. COVID-19 is one of those moments. And, if we have learned anything from this crisis, it is how truly awe-inspiring the strength of our combined team members can be when faced with the unknown.

Our nurses, and others, have endured unique war-like circumstances since the first week in March. One confirmed case turned into a thousand within mere days. Empathic and compassionate caregivers were turned into combatants who had to face ""the invisible enemy."" Our response was courageous, having to put aside our fears for ourselves and our loved ones, to answer the call to action. Ingenuity, creativity, and fortitude forced us to think differently and change care models as patient statuses rapidly deteriorated. Had our team members not been there, the numbers of casualties would have been far greater, which can't be underscored enough.

This newfound sense of camaraderie has made us stronger, with an enhanced ability to move swiftly and adapt to ever-changing situations.

COVID-19's playbook continues to be written by nursing teams throughout the continuum of care. When the patients present in the emergency department, we are now able to distinguish the early signs and differences between the coronavirus and the flu. We know how to treat less severe cases, advising them when to return to hospitals if their condition worsens. We know which respiratory treatments work, how they should be delivered, and how often. We also know that proning patients can be the difference between intubation and regular oxygen.

Unfortunately, we've been conditioned to the dramatic, intense, and long workdays. But even the hardest of situations come to an end. We've turned a corner and entered a stage where each ""code"" called overheard during the pandemic's early days has been replaced by chiming bells for a patient who was extubated, or hearing The Beatles' ""Here Comes the Sun"" when patients are discharged.

Distress has transitioned into perseverance, evidenced in the smiling eyes visible through a nurse's mask as they line our hallways to celebrate key moments in this fight. This is what resilience and hope looks like.

The stark truth is that nurses won't come out of this unscathed. We already have a greater appreciation for humanity and the fragility of life. Empathy and compassion have not changed. Neither has our mission. But what will be the pandemic's final toll on nurses?

During times of decompression and reflection, fears, anxieties, and concerns will arise. There will be physical and mental health issues, too, both of which need to be quickly identified and remedied. We need to establish tranquility and wellness opportunities for our nurses, and provide them with avenues to talk about what they are feeling and ensure them that they are not alone. We need to support these valiant team members just as they have been there for our patients and the community throughout this crisis.

I couldn't be prouder of our frontline team and how our nurses have responded. Through the chaos and uncertainty, caring and compassion never failed. We've been on both sides of recovery and unfortunate death. It's been heart-touching and heart-breaking all in the same breath.

We can only hope we don't have to do it again.

Opinion contributor

Some curious photos began rocketing around social media sites Wednesday night — pictures of people in Wisconsin once again in their natural habitat, crammed shoulder to shoulder in bars.

Fortunately, the patrons were not drinking shots of flaming Lysol or Cloroxtinis. Unfortunately, there were no masks to be found, and the only thing drinkers were distancing from were their inhibitions. Just hours earlier, the Wisconsin Supreme Court had struck down a statewide ""safer at home"" order that, among other things, closed “nonessential” businesses and ordered people to stay in their homes, with limited exceptions. The order itself was fairly standard for states across America.

For weeks, Republicans had argued that their lawsuit against the order was needed simply so the legislature could have some say in the reopening plan. ""We want not a Democratic plan, not a Republican plan, we want a Wisconsin plan where we're all working together,” Assembly Majority Leader Jim Steineke said May 7.

But now it appears their plan all along was to thwart any plan. Now that they’ve been granted a seat at the table, Republicans have set the table on fire and thrown it out the window.

GOP argued Dem order was confusing

The governor’s unilateral “safer at home"" order was set to expire May 26, at which point a gradual reopening would continue to take place. (Some business restrictions have already been lifted.)

But Republicans in the Wisconsin Legislature challenged the order, complaining that the governor, through his health secretary-designee, had both cut them out of the process and exceeded his authority. They took Democratic Gov. Tony Evers to court, emerging victorious on Wednesday.

The ruling leaves Wisconsin without any statewide rule or guidance in place for businesses, citizens and local governments. After the decision, Republicans said they didn’t see any need for any new rules, instead turning the state into a patchwork of local COVID-19 regulations, stretched throughout nearly 2,000 counties, cities, villages and towns. (Ironically, in the lawsuit, GOP attorneys argued that the statewide order was confusing — but without the order, every local government may now have different regulations and expiration dates.)

This is all taking place in a state that has weathered a decade of all-out partisan war, dating to the days of 2011 when tens of thousands of people occupied the state Capitol protesting Republican Gov. Scott Walker’s plan to virtually eliminate public sector collective bargaining. After an attempt to recall Walker failed, state politics has grown more bitter, culminating in Republicans forcing citizens to vote in-person during a spring election on April 7.

False choices:Protesters should demand coronavirus safety and a reopened economy. We can have both.

The lawsuit itself was based on a preposterous argument: The legislature argued that the health secretary’s “order,” which, according to state statute does not require legislative oversight, was instead a “rule,” which can be vetoed by lawmakers. But the extremely broad statute granting the executive branch emergency powers explicitly separates the two, saying the department ""may promulgate and enforce rules or issue orders for guarding against the introduction of any communicable disease” (my emphasis). In fact, the legislature specifically added the authority for the governor to issue unilateral orders back in 1982, when the state was grappling with the rapid spread of AIDS.

Basically, the Wisconsin Legislature argued in favor of disregarding a law passed by … the Wisconsin Legislature.

Rush to bars doesn't inspire hope

Nonetheless, as pointed out by liberal Justice Rebecca Dallet in her dissent, four conservative members of the court who won elections by campaigning against the idea of judges writing new laws went ahead and wrote a whole new law merging “orders” with “rules.”

“A majority of this court falls hook, line and sinker for the legislature's tactic to rewrite a duly enacted statute through litigation rather than legislation,” wrote Dallet, adding that “this decision will undoubtedly go down as one of the most blatant examples of judicial activism in this court's history.” (One conservative justice, Brian Hagedorn, sided with the liberal judges in the three-justice minority.)

Coronavirus pause:People need people, but it's risky to resume social activities so soon

Having been abandoned by the state, at least 17 communities immediately instituted stay-at-home orders of their own to continue the success the state has had in mitigating the damage of the virus. But on Friday, despite an attorney general opinion that said local governments do have the power to issue such orders as long as there are no criminal penalties attached, at least eight local governments rescinded their orders, leaving their communities unprotected. (The state’s two largest cities, Milwaukee and Madison, kept their regulations, believing they are lawful.)

Ultimately, it is now up to the state’s citizens to practice responsible distancing, wear masks and take other necessary precautions. But the rush to get back to the bars does not inspire confidence that everyone will be taking this seriously enough.

Vietnam shares a border with China, yet it has reported no deaths from COVID-19 and just 268 confirmed cases, when other Southeast Asian nations are reporting thousands.

Experts say experience dealing with prior pandemics, early implementation of aggressive social distancing policies, strong action from political leaders and the muscle of a one-party authoritarian state have helped Vietnam.

""They had political commitment early on at the highest level,"" says John MacArthur, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's country representative in neighboring Thailand. ""And that political commitment went from central level all the way down to the hamlet level.""

With experience gained from dealing with the 2003 SARS and 2009 H1N1 pandemics, Vietnam's government started organizing its response in January — as soon as reports began trickling in from Wuhan, China, where the virus is believed to have originated. The country quickly came up with a variety of tactics, including widespread quarantining and aggressive contact tracing. It has also won praise from the World Health Organization and the CDC for its transparency in dealing with the crisis.

Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc recently characterized Vietnam's efforts as the ""spring general offensive of 2020,"" a reference to the 1968 Tet Offensive, which many claim helped turn the tide of the Vietnam War.

Tens of thousands have been put in quarantine camps. By the end of March, Vietnam had banned all international and domestic flights. The government locked down the country on April 1. State-run media say the current social distancing and stay-at-home orders are to be extended for at least another week.

Streets normally buzzing with motorcycles and cars are almost empty in most large cities. As the economic toll of the lockdown becomes apparent, some entrepreneurs are stepping up to help. One has provided ""rice ATMs"" to dispense free rice to those who are out of work.

Some may still be skeptical of Vietnam's relatively low COVID-19 case numbers. The CDC's MacArthur is not.

""Our team up in Hanoi is working very, very closely with their Ministry of Health counterparts,"" he says. ""The communications I've had with my Vietnam team is that at this point in time, [they] don't have any indication that those numbers are false.""",real

Opinion contributor

The coronavirus projections coming from experts have two major components: How mobile we are (that is, are we leaving home) and how well we “socially distance” to six feet or more unless we are wearing a mask. The other parts of the models are important, but all are easier to predict on the basis of what happened in each locality when 100% of the country was supposed to be on “lockdown.”

This isn’t that complicated. Since the projections are based to a real extent on mobility and distancing, by definition the projections will change as we open up the economy and how we do it. We will be heading right back toward the same deadly peaks unless we socially distance — because social distancing is how we got the curves to go down in the first place.

Wear a donut or use a hockey stick

►This 6-foot separation is not a joke and people are just plain irresponsible if they don’t pay attention to it. A man in Italy has created a 6-foot donut to wear; Canadians use hockey sticks. In Germany, a restaurant gave patrons hats with pool noodles on them to remind them to distance. We need an easy foldable device; patent it and make millions.

“It won't happen to me!” That’s not the issue. Everyone gets counted in the projections – including the people on the beach. We are already seeing it. The latest projections are 147,000 U.S. deaths by August. This is more than double the projections just a month ago. What happened? Better modeling? No. Massive uprising against social distancing? Yes. If we don’t social distance, and soon, numbers will reach the tipping point and locality by locality, we will all be forced to stay home — just like last time. No one wants that!

►That 6-foot distance has been determined scientifically, but I am concerned with the effectiveness of the masks we are wearing at distances less than six feet. If they don’t work then this is the worst case of more certain transmission. We should only be able to buy masks that prevent transmission to, say two feet, when worn correctly. Each mask should have instructions enclosed for how to wear it. I have an N95 mask, and it is difficult to breathe. Hopefully other masks can be effective for those who are not first responders.

When do negative tests expire?

►Testing for presence of the virus. As we increase testing (and hopefully make it more accurate), we of course need to understand that just the math will decrease the number of cases per million people. A nationally-comparable statistic must be developed and continually published that accounts for increased testing or we will develop a false sense of security “blaming” the increase in positives on increased testing. Publishing each state’s number of tests per million people and number of positives per million people will help to avoid the false sense of security by “blaming” the increase in positives on increased testing.

Coronavirus pause: People need people, but it's risky to resume social activities so soon

There is an important issue raised by people in the White House not wearing masks and turning positive. All had been tested negative – until they weren’t. So we must ask the question, “How long is a negative test good for?” Maybe three days or five days? At least food in the grocery store has an expiration date. No one has told us the expiration date for a negative test.

Nobody is no-risk in Russian Roulette

Everyone who is tested once as negative has to be re-tested very frequently. Same for the contact tracing. Have we dialed those numbers into our testing procedures? If we don’t test this frequently, then we are kidding ourselves that testing means anything: you are negative until you are exposed to the next positive person who may be asymptomatic.

Does everyone need to be tested for the virus, or for antibodies? Some have said no. But if not, then how do we deal with the five presumably low risk people who contracted the virus recently at a birthday party where no one was social distancing or wearing a mask? Seems like a game of Russian Roulette; you can't predict who gets the bullet.

Reaching teens:Why are young people so bad at coronavirus social distancing? Blame their brains.

Pay close attention to Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New York, which has returned to where it was March 19 in deaths and hospitalizations. New York is re-opening extremely carefully. If the hospitalizations and deaths in New York, start back up, I believe we will see that for the rest of the country.

From what we know today, until there is a vaccine that is available and works for all, we are stuck with this virus and must socially distance and wear masks. Every one of us can do that right now. If we don’t, it won't be their problem, it will be your personal problem when we are all shut back in. Right around election time.

She goes on, quite a bit. Air is cleaner. “The world quieter.”

The list ends with this confident assertion: “I’m pretty sure this was God’s way of telling us to slow down and focus on what is important!!”

That old trickster, God. He does have His mysterious ways, doesn’t He? Setting the lives of millions on fire, just so we fortunate few can enjoy the warm glow and toast marshmallows on their burning homes.

Unlimbering the rhetorical bazooka I always keep conveniently slung over my shoulder, I squinted into the gunsight, seeing the tiny figure of my neighbor, smiling over her freshly-coined public wisdom. My finger tensed.

Then I sighed, lowered my weapon, and decided to demonstrate my wit and humanity in a novel fashion: by saying nothing.

Sure, I could have archly pointed out that hiding in the basement could be fun, provided you have a comfortable, well-stocked basement. But not everybody does. These are excruciatingly tough times, and if the scythe hasn’t swung in your direction, yet, the least you can do is not crow about it.

But you can’t scold a joyful person into silent gratitude. Just as you can’t shame a sad one into abandoning their sorrow as insignificant. It’s graduation time. My neighborhood is festooned with college flags, congratulatory signs, balloons, big orange and blue Illini I’s painted on lawns. Online, bursts of milestone festivity, shadowed with a definite sense of loss. No commencement. No prom. It’s not fair! After seeing a few, I considered creating a meme: a soft sepia passport photo of Anne Frank, with the tagline, “Not every teen got to go to prom.” That’ll show ‘em. Think of the retweets! Dozens!

I also held that back. I’m not the coronavirus mullah, wandering cyberspace in my long white beard and black robes, taking a reed switch to the legs of anybody who dares be too happy or too sad. I don’t want to show up at the virtual wake for high school life and castigate the mourners.

People should be allowed their joys and sorrows without strangers whipping out a tape measure. And if they celebrate or mourn a bit too much, well, maybe the sin of pointing it out is worse than either supposed wrong that’s being reprimanded. When the boys were small, and the cat knocked over the younger one’s goldfish bowl, I didn’t harangue him about The Six Million. I dried his tears and presided over the toilet-bowl-side funeral service. It was his fish and he loved it.

Here is the deep, rare and hard-won insight I’ve discovered and want to share, because I find it useful during this crisis, as useful as hand sanitizer: it isn’t all about me. Or you. If you want a clear picture of what it’s like not to grasp this, look to our president. His life teaches many things, but the central lesson is the corrosive power of ego. Ego poisons. It ruins everything, and the more you make every situation about yourself, the worse your life will be. You can be president of the United States, rich, famous, and beloved, in certain quarters, but if you can’t sympathize with anyone, can’t perceive people who are not yourself. then you’re pathetic.

I was griping to a friend last month about the difficulties of living with two men in their early 20s, law students whose schools are closed, who now spend all day lounging around my house, learning to argue incisively when a bell rings. Young men who, I discovered to my surprise and horror, seem to have been raised by a sharp-tongued, not-always-kind individual. Guys who don’t hop to their feet whenever their father shuffles into the room, nor exhibit kindness, or even attention, should he speak.

I expected her to sympathize. She did, but not with me.

“Imagine how hard this must be for them,” my friend Barbara said. “Yanked out of their schools, apart from their friends, stuck with their parents.”

Well .... yeah ... there is that.

I’ve been rolling that phrase around a lot lately. “Imagine how hard this must be for them.”

Most eligible Americans have by now received their check, called economic impact payments, though some are still being mailed to those who did not provide direct deposit information to the IRS. The checks have provided something of a cushion to the tens of millions of people who are out of work or have had their hours reduced, though many critics and lawmakers said they did not go far enough. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said a second round of direct payments is ""necessary"" for the survival of many Americans, and that they would help stimulate the economy. But those checks are not likely to hit bank accounts soon, if at all. Here's what you need to know.

Where does the legislation stand?

House Democrats introduced the Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions Act, or HEROES Act, a new piece of coronavirus legislation, that, among other relief measures, includes a second round of stimulus payments of up to $1,200 per person. The bill was passed in the House on Friday, but it is unlikely to make it through the Republican-controlled Senate, at least in its current form, NBC News reports. ""What Nancy Pelosi is proposing will never pass the Senate,"" Republican Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming said Tuesday.

How much would the checks be worth?

Under the legislation, individuals would receive another payment of up to $1,200 (or $2,400 for married couples), and $1,200 per dependent (up to three). The income eligibility thresholds would be the same as the first round of checks: Individuals earning up to $75,000 and couples earning up to $150,000 would receive $1,200. After that, the checks would completely phase out at $99,000 for individuals and $198,000 for couples.

What about dependents?

Unlike the first round of checks, all dependents would be eligible for the additional credit, not just those under 17. And that credit is worth much more: $1,200, compared to $500 for the first round. Each household could receive a maximum of three dependent credits. The first round of stimulus checks excluded adult dependents, including many in college.

What else is different?

This legislation also does not require recipients have a Social Security number to be eligible, which means those who file taxes with a taxpayer identification number (TIN) could receive a check this time around. Those without an SSN were excluded from the first round of checks.

Whether the costs of the outbreak turn out to be historically large or not, there is a risk that investors’ worries will snowball during this period of uncertainty, leading them to panic-sell and exacerbate any financial damage. “If in the next 20 years [the economy is] only going to be disrupted for three months, that suggests a very small impact on the market,” says Robert J. Shiller, a Nobel Prize–winning economist and the author of Narrative Economics: How Stories Go Viral and Drive Major Economic Events. But the situation could be much worse, and when investors think in “grandiose terms,” Shiller told me, that could “trigger other worrying.”

Predicting the emotional reactions of the entire world population to coronavirus would be a bit easier if investors could turn to the market effects of previous pandemics for guidance. But history provides few indications of what might happen to the economy if the coronavirus and COVID-19, the disease it causes, continue to spread. “This is kind of a new thing,” Shiller said. “It’s too much to ask for the market to get it right.”

The closest analogue is the global influenza outbreak of 1918 and ’19, which killed tens of millions of people. In 1918, the stock market actually did fine—the Dow rose a little. In the years after that, Sylla noted, “the stock market didn’t do much, and while its trend was flat, there were fluctuations within that—some ups and downs, just like we see now.”

But drawing any conclusions from 100 years ago is difficult because, among other reasons, a lot of other stuff was happening then—namely, World War I. Because of that, says John Wald, a professor at the University of Texas at San Antonio’s College of Business, “it’s really hard to say whether [the 1918 pandemic] was priced correctly or not correctly” by the market.

Perhaps a better parallel is the flu pandemic of 1957 and ’58, which originated in East Asia and killed at least 1 million people, including an estimated 116,000 in the U.S. In the second half of 1957, the Dow fell about 15 percent. “Other things happened over that time period” too, Wald notes, but “at least there was no world war.” More recent outbreaks, such as SARS and MERS, were more contained and didn’t wreak as much global economic havoc.

Although the annual flu season is quite different from a pandemic, it does provide a good amount of data for economists to analyze. When Wald, along with the researchers Brian McTier and Yiuman Tse, examined trading records from 1998 to 2006, they found that in weeks when the flu was more widespread, stock-market returns were lower. They also found that when there was a higher incidence of the flu in the greater New York City area in particular, trading volume decreased, which is usually bad for the market. Here, the idea is that more professional investors might have gotten sick and executed fewer trades—which would not bode well if COVID-19 were to make its way to New York City.",real

In an interview with the Chinese news network CGTN on Saturday, Wuhan Institute of Virology Director Wang Yanyi once again rejected the Trump administration's claims that the coronavirus came from the institute's lab.

""This is pure fabrication. Our institute first received the clinical sample of the unknown pneumonia on 30 December last year"", she said, adding that after institute experts ""checked the pathogen within the sample, we found it contained a new coronavirus, which is now called SARS-CoV-2"".

""We didn't have any knowledge before that, nor had we ever encountered, researched, or kept the virus. In fact, like everyone else, we didn't even know the virus existed. How could it have leaked from our lab when we never had it?"", Wang pointed out.

She also recalled the ""current consensus of the international academic community"" on COVID-19 which suggests that ""the virus originated from wild animals"", but added ""we still don't clearly know what kind of viruses that all different wild species carry across the globe and where the viruses that are highly similar to SARS-CoV-2 are"".

""This is why cooperation between scientists all over the world is needed to find the answers. Therefore, the issue of origin-tracking is ultimately a question of science, which requires scientists to make judgments based on scientific data and facts"", Wang underscored.

Beijing Rejects Washington's Virus Origin Claims

Her remarks come as Washington continues to assert that COVID-19 came from a Wuhan biolab, with President Donald Trump claiming earlier in May that ""probably it was incompetence"" and that ""somebody was stupid"", in an apparent reference to Wuhan Institute of Virology staff.

He was echoed by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo who blamed China for covering up the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan and pointed to alleged ""enormous evidence"" that the coronavirus originated in a Wuhan biolab.

The allegations have consistently been rejected by the Chinese Foreign Ministry, which called on the US to ""handle its domestic affairs properly first"", rather than shift blame and the focus onto China.

The Ministry also pointed out that World Health Organisation officials have ""repeatedly stated that there is no evidence showing the virus was made in a lab"".

""Now [US officials] are again hyping up the issue of origins, insinuating that the virus had something to do with the Wuhan Institute of Virology. It's not difficult to see through their tricks which intend to muddy the waters, deflect attention, and shift the blame to others"", Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said last month.

Also in April, Yuan Zhiming, vice director of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, told CGTN ""there is no way"" that the coronavirus was man-made, adding, ""we have a strict regulatory regime and code of conduct of research, so we are confident"".

""It's bad when some are deliberately trying to mislead people. […] The Washington Post and several other reporters wrote about the virus coming from the Wuhan lab. They have no evidence, or knowledge, this is entirely based on speculation"", Yuan stressed.",fake

A CDC panel usually decides","No matter how well-prepared we are, there won’t immediately be enough coronavirus vaccine to immunize all Americans. Choices will have to be made about who goes to the front of the line.

“It’s inevitable that the vaccine will come out more slowly than we like. We’re not going to have 350 million doses delivered day one,” said Andrew Pavia, chief of pediatric infectious diseases at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City.

To be most protective, a list of the first to be immunized must be carefully crafted based on what type of vaccine may become available, who it works best for and whether the disease is still raging.

Since 1964, the United States has relied on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to make those decisions. As soon as the Food and Drug Administration licenses a new vaccine, ACIP offers guidelines on how it should be distributed, to whom and when.

The World Health Organization has a similar group, the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization.

More:Latest on global search for coronavirus vaccine: Oxford vaccine may protect monkeys from COVID

More:'Our moon shot': The world needs a coronavirus vaccine ASAP. Despite drugmakers billion-dollar bets, one might not be available for years.

ACIP already has begun working on a plan for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The WHO group began its process last week.

“We’re starting as early as we can to deal with the torrent of data that’s coming out,"" said Dr. Grace Lee, a professor of pediatrics at Stanford University School of Medicine and a current ACIP member. ""We don’t want to wait until the vaccine becomes available and begin our deliberations then.”

Typically, ACIP’s guidelines would be used without question. That became slightly less clear Friday with the announcement of a White House initiative called Operation Warp Speed.

In a news conference in the Rose Garden, President Donald Trump said the initiative would create a group of experts and bring together the CDC, National Institutes of Health, the FDA and the U.S. military to work at “record speed” to find, test, manufacture and distribute a vaccine.

Moncef Slaoui, a former pharmaceutical executive who Trump named to head Operation Warp Speed, said early clinical trial data from at least one vaccine candidate made him confident “we will be able to deliver a few hundred million doses of vaccine by the end of 2020. We will do the best we can to do that.”

Trump announces 'Operation Warp Speed,' says U.S. could have coronavirus vaccine by January

Vaccine experts have consistently urged caution in presuming a vaccine will be available soon. The White House Coronavirus Task Force's Dr. Anthony Fauci has said that while a vaccine is likely within the next year or two, the process takes time. Securing a vaccine quickly would require everything falling exactly into place, the director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases has said.

""You can rush vaccine development but only when you understand – there’s no way around it – you are trading safety for speed,"" said Dr. Greg Poland, director of the Mayo Clinic's Vaccine Research Group.

Few details of how coordination within Operation Warp Speed would work were provided, and it is unclear what role it will play in vaccine allocation. An unnamed government official involved with the initiative told CNN earlier this month one of the tasks of the group is to determine who gets the first doses.

The CDC referred inquiries about how the two groups would work together to the White House. The White House did not respond to a request for clarification.

Vaccine experts have spent years considering the best and most effective way to dole out immunizations. ACIP has clear and transparent guidelines on how to conduct the process available on its website, and all its meetings in which it votes on vaccine recommendations are public and webcast. The next is on June 24.

Discussions center on balancing protection for the largest number of people with protecting the most vulnerable.

“If I’ve only got 30 million doses for the next year and I’ve got a population of 350 million, who do I assign propriety to?” said Dr. Arthur Reingold, division head of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of California at Berkeley and an internationally recognized expert on infectious disease.

Health care providers, first responders, the military, political leaders, older adults, pregnant women and children are generally put at the front of the line, depending on the disease and the vaccine, said Reingold, who served on ACIP for many years.

“All kinds of ethicists are brought to the table,” he said.

Another approach to control an epidemic is to focus on hot spots where a disease is spreading and there are high transmission rates.

""You would rush vaccine to the area, open your clinics and try to get a large proportion of the population vaccinated quickly,"" Pavia said.

For SARS-CoV-2, the devil is in the details because so much remains unknown about who it affects and how.

Vaccines differ. One may be best for healthy adults, another better for children, and a third most effective for older adults or those with preexisting medical conditions.

In the case of the new coronavirus, data might show although older people are severely affected by COVID-19, immunizing their caregivers could better protect them, depending on how effective the vaccine is for different ages.

“We think about who’s at risk for being exposed, who suffers the worst complications and which population provides the highest benefit due to herd immunity,” said Lee.

Herd immunity is when enough people in the population have been infected and developed immunity to the virus that it can no longer spread freely. Scientists' models estimate 65% of the population needs to be immune to establish such immunity and stop the spread of the disease.

So far, infection rates alone are nowhere near high enough to create herd immunity. While a national infection rate in the United States has not yet been determined, in France, an estimated 4.4% of the population is believed to have been infected with the disease as of May 11, according to a paper in the journal Science.

Whoever determines who gets inoculated first, public health experts say past experience shows the best medical conclusion isn’t always the best solution.

During a shortage of flu vaccine in 2004, it was decided that elderly people, who were at high risk, should get vaccinated first. It turned out they didn’t want it.

“They said, ‘I’d rather my grandchildren receive the vaccine,’ ” said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor in the division of infectious disease at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee.

After health care workers and first responders are immunized, Schaffner suggested simply making a vaccine available on a first-come, first-served basis.

“Vaccine left in the refrigerator never protected anyone from anything,” he said.

Some health care professionals say Americans need to be part of the conversation about how any coming coronavirus vaccine should be doled out.

“We need to engage with the public now. You’ve got to consider public values,” said Daniel Salmon, a professor of international health who directs the Institute for Vaccine Safety at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “It’s not all about what the scientists think.”",real

Each year, the Eurovision Song Contest unites 180 million viewers in more than 40 countries for an electric-falsetto night of glitter, glam and hard-rock hallelujah.

This year, the coronavirus pandemic forced the cancellation of the contest for the first time in its 64-year history. But instead of leaving so many super fans dance-crying to the 1974 winner Waterloo (ABBA), the song contest has instead decided to air a live two-hour special, Eurovision: Europe Shine a Light, Saturday on public broadcasting channels in more than 40 countries. (The U.S. is not one of them, so anyone living in that country will have to watch on Eurovision's YouTube channel, where the show will be live-streamed.)

The show is hosted in the Netherlands, where the contest was supposed to be held this year at the Ahoy concert hall. (The venue has been converted into an emergency hospital for coronavirus patients). All 41 contestants will perform remotely, though this year fans won't be able to phone in their votes for the winner.

Eurovision Song Contest YouTube

The pre-pandemic 2020 favorites included the nerd-disco gem Think About Things by Iceland's Dadi og Gagnamagnid; the bodice-ripper Cleopatra by Azerbaijan's Efendi; and the auto-tuned hallucination jig that is Uno by Russia's Little Big.

In the weeks leading up to the show, several Eurovision performers past and present participated in sweet, low-key home concerts. Fans who missed the signature pyrotechnic drama also turned to Eurovision.TV to look up the vampire-opera ""It's My Life"" by Romania's super-soprano Cesar (2013) or the Hellenic solid-gold dancing in My Number One by Greece's Helena Paparizou, the 2005 winner.

The Eurovision song contest began in 1956 to bring together a continent shattered by World War II. Seven countries competed that first year, and the winner, Refrain by Switzerland's Lys Assia, is about lost love and innocence. The contest grew to include more countries, including those not in Europe, like Israel.

In the early years, performers were often backed by live orchestras. They sang in their native language: Vivo Cantando (1969), Hallelujah (1979), Ein bisschen Frieden (1982). As newlyweds in Athens in the 1970s, my parents lived next-door to the 1976 contestant from Greece, folk singer Mariza Koch, who sang this beautiful song in Greek. When I moved to Greece more than a decade ago, I befriended the 1995 contestant from Cyprus, who sang this Eurovision cult classic, also in Greek.

These days, it's mainly the French and Italians crooning in their native tongues, with these award-winning exceptions.

The Eurovision Song Contest has also expanded far beyond Europe and now includes Australia, though it did lose Hungary this year.

Hungary's national public broadcasting association said it wanted to focus its resources on ""Hungarian pop singers"" though one report said pro government media called the contest a ""homosexual flotilla."" Hungary has never won the contest but came in fourth in 1994 with this ballad sung by Friderika Bayer.

Many fans observing social distancing cannot hold Eurovision parties at home this year. Some made up for it with online watch parties, which involved tuning in remotely to watch reruns of previous contests. At Saturday night's Eurovision alternative, a featured performance will be the unity anthem Love Shine a Light by Katrina and the Waves, the 1997 winner. The super fans might sing along and also hope that ABBA will too.",real

In her now-world-famous writing, Chinese author Fang Fang implores: ""The departed are gone, but the living must go on. As before. I just hope we can remember.""

The writer's detailed account of the novel coronavirus outbreak in the Chinese city of Wuhan, originally published in Chinese as a daily diary as the virus rapidly spread there, becomes available in English on Friday as Wuhan Diary: Dispatches from a Quarantined City. Bits and clips of Fang Fang's writing on the situation in Wuhan made it out of China and into English as the outbreak was unfolding, but now the full account will be available in English.

Memory is central to Fang Fang's diary. So is making sense of the complete absence of things: of life as we knew it; of any and all economic activity. Like tens of millions of other readers, I read Fang Fang in the monotony of self-isolation, looking for a common understanding of how the pandemic had changed the country we were living in — China.

Before the novel coronavirus engulfed the Chinese city of Wuhan, Fang Fang was already an award-winning novelist of realist fiction. But her chronicle of the lockdown of her hometown Wuhan might be her most lasting work.

Fang Fang penned her first entry on January 25, two days after the city was suddenly sealed off from the rest of China, to let friends and anyone curious understand ""what is really going on here on the ground in Wuhan."" Over the next 59 entries spanning more than two months, her writing veers from a collection of the quotidian aspects of life under lockdown to her mounting frustration with local officials — no small gesture of bravery in China.

Out of necessity, her diary supersedes any kind of traditional literary work, in both content and form.

By early February, China's Internet censors were working overtime, during the height of the epidemic, to erase critical content. Fang Fang's diary thus often serves as an archive, describing videos and news items usually deleted by the time she managed to publish her daily entry. As her online diary begins to attract millions of readers, she begins incorporating information gleaned from text messages and phone calls from well-connected friends in the arts and medical fields, forming a kind of written collage of Wuhan.

Eventually, the censors came for Fang Fang. Loyal readers took screenshots of her entries before they were deleted, or helped repost entires on various other social media channels.

Unfortunately, the English translation of her diary in book form is not able to capture this multidimensionality. Wuhan Diary loses much of its engaging, real-time nature by condensing her 60 entries into a single tome. Nonetheless, it is a heroic feat of speedy translation from veteran Michael Berry.

""You have that whole connecting universe extending from her diary entries...of course, reading it now, after the fact, is a very different experience,"" Berry, who is also translating Fang Fang's last novel, Soft Burial, told NPR. Still, readers in the U.S. will likely find many of her gripes about local officials and the burden of social distancing all too relevant.

Fang Fang's Wuhan diary remains significant as a document of the trivial, tragic and absurd during Wuhan's 76 days of lockdown. Such a document is especially important now, when so much of how the coronavirus spread — and what governments across the world did or did not do to contain it — is already being contested by the U.S. and China.

""Imagine this: the author Fang Fang did not exist in today's Wuhan...What would we have heard? What would we have seen?"" asked writer Yan Lianke in a widely-shared online talk in late February. Memory, Yan goes on to say, is the most basic hedge against future injustice: ""While memories may not give us the power to change reality, it can at least raise a question in our hearts when a lie comes our way.""

Fang Fang's diary, then, is an important record how Wuhan's people suffered and ultimately persevered, even as the state wants to erase its initial fumbles from the official record.

Raising questions does not make one popular in China these days. Nearly immediately after she began publishing her entries, an online army of ultra-nationalists deluged Fang Fang, indignant that in airing doubts about the superiority of China's coronavirus containment she was betraying her motherland. That her diary could be published in English only months after the Wuhan lockdown was lifted, they hinted darkly, meant Fang Fang was deliberately aiding Western countries to smear China and to profit off the suffering of Wuhan. Berry says even he has received thousands of angry emails and death threats for simply translating her writing.

One anonymous letter, allegedly written by a high school student, lambasted Fang Fang for airing China's dirty laundry out for everyone to see. ""My child, I also want to tell you that when I was 16 years old, I was much worse off than you are. At that time, I had never even heard of words like 'independent thought,'"" Fang Fang gently wrote back.

China today is more globalized and more confident than ever. It has also become more hostile to foreign ideas, suspicious they are Western designs to stop China's rise, and has demonstrated its willingness to engage in bare-knuckles diplomacy.

Voices like Fang Fang's — who remember well the brutal decade of the Cultural Revolution, when adolescent Maoists tortured, persecuted and beat to death the politically incorrect, as well as the subsequent prosperity of economic reform and opening— are increasingly rare in China. But in the context of larger conversations being had about China and its place in the world, American readers would do well to remember they exist.

The actual fiscal stimulus in the package is about $24 billion, which is less than one percent of the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) - equivalent to India's total goods and services.

The COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing lockdown has brought the economic activity to a complete standstill for about two months now. Even as lockdown relaxations have been eased by the Indian Home Ministry, the country's apex bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Friday hinted at negative Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth in the current financial year, which ends next March.

This represents the first recognition by any Indian government entity of the fact that the country is staring at an economic recession, which is technically two consecutive quarters of negative growth.

Without providing any guidance or range in which the Indian growth will contract in the current financial year due to the pandemic, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said, “GDP growth in 2020-21 is estimated to remain in negative territory, with some pick-up in growth impulses from the second half (October 2020 – March 2021) onwards. Much will depend on how quickly the COVID curve flattens and begins to moderate”.

Experts, however, believe that the fact that there is going to be a recession due to the pandemic is a given. The question is how deep is it going to be?

Indian Prime Minister Modi, in a televised address on 24 March, announced a national lockdown at a four hours’ notice. The economy has remained shut ever since then with some relaxations like allowing factories and industrial units to open up with limited staff.

The Indian railway ministry has also started limited passenger services and the ministry of civil aviation has allowed limited flights to begin operating from 25 May.

Even though the macroeconomic data for April, the first month of the financial year, hasn’t been published yet, the Indian government’s March data on some macro indicators reveals that the crisis is deep.

A week’s lockdown in March completely wiped out the industrial output for month contracting 16.7 percent. This compares with growth of 4.62 percent in the preceding month of February and 2.08 percent in January.

If that is an indication of the severe impact of a seven-day lockdown, Professsor N.R. Bhanumurthy from the National Institute Public Finance and Policy gives us a sneak peek into the depth of recessionary crisis that lies ahead for the Indian economy

“The current quarter (April-June) and the next two quarters are likely to see negative growth according to studies done by us based on financial modelling. All will depend heavily on the manner in which the macro-economic policies and announcements are implemented. Even with the measures taken through the economic stimulus announced recently, growth will come back only in the fourth quarter of the current financial year (Jan-March 2021),” Bhanumurthy told Sputnik.

Referring to the Modi’s $266 billion economic stimulus package announced on 12 May, Bhanumurthy said even if the benefits of the package are taken into account, the Indian GDP growth will remain zero in the current financial year due to the impact of the package. And, had the Indian government not announced the stimulus, the GDP growth in the financial year 2020-21 would have contracted by at least 12.5 percent.

That said, he also points towards deep recession claiming that even with the stimulus package in place, there is hardly going to be any relief until December.

“We are expecting a 26 percent contraction in growth in the ongoing quarter (April-June) in comparison to the same period last year. And a de-growth of 12.5 per cent each is likely to take place in the both July-September and October-December quarter. However, these assessments may change if government announces further measures in between,” said Bhanumurthy.

It is not that the Indian economy was doing great either before the lockdown. Beginning early 2018 the Indian economy had been slowing down with GDP falling almost every consecutive quarter due to the combined impact its financial sector crisis as well as the US-China trade war. From over 8 percent growth in early 2018, the Indian GDP collapsed by almost half to 4.7 in October – December 2019.

“We expect the economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak to weigh on already fragile household consumption which, coupled with sluggish business activity, will result in a sharp decline in India's economic growth in fiscal 2020-21,” said Deborah Tan, a Moody's Assistant Vice President and Analyst.

“Even before the coronavirus outbreak, the economy had already been growing at its slowest pace in six years. Adding the impact from the outbreak, Moody's now expects India's real GDP to contract in the fiscal year ending March 2021 (fiscal 2020-21) compared with an earlier projection of zero growth,” Tan added.

The stimulus announced by Prime Minister Modi weighs heavily on sovereign backed funding arrangements for businesses from banks and financial institutions rather than acting as a direct fiscal stimulus.

A key lawmaker from India’s principal opposition party Congress, P. Chidambaram, a former finance minister, has criticised Modi’s stimulus plan saying that government opted for liquidity measures to boost supply at a time when fiscal measures should have been taken to boost demand to revitalise the economy.

Challenges, however, remain for the economy. And RBI Governor Das’s statement sums those up.

“Domestic economic activity has been impacted severely by the 2 months lockdown. The top 6 industrialised states that account for about 60 percent of industrial output are largely in red or orange zones. High frequency indicators point to a collapse in demand beginning in March 2020 across both urban and rural segments. The biggest blow from COVID-19 has been to private consumption, which accounts for about 60 percent of domestic demand. The production of consumer durables fell by 33 percent in March 2020, accompanied by a 16 percent decline in the output of non-durables.”",fake

Oil prices bounced back a bit after President Trump said the Department of Energy would buy crude for the nation's strategic petroleum reserve.

""We're going to fill it right to the top,"" Trump said Friday in a wide-ranging news conference at the White House. He said it will save taxpayers ""billions and billions of dollars"" while helping an industry that's been reeling.

While oil prices increased nearly 5% after Friday's announcement, that was just a fraction of the amount they lost earlier in the week.

In South Texas, Rudy Martinez immediately experienced the effects of the past week's collapse in crude oil prices.

""I actually have a little man camp and these guys are on the way out because they lost contracts,"" says Martinez, who has eight rooms he rents to out-of-town oilfield workers in Karnes City, Texas.

""The workers get their per-diem and I charge them $100 a person [per week]. Actually I'd like to charge them a little more than that, but now that it's tapered off, it's hard to charge them that because they can't pay it,"" he says.

Back when the oil business was really booming in Karnes City, Martinez says he could charge up to $2000 a week per person.

This is one small example of what declining oil prices mean for the rural communities that depend on the oil business. And there's a lot at stake for the U.S., the world's largest producer of crude oil.

Oil prices had been falling out of fears the coronavirus epidemic threatened world economic growth. Demand was also down as large gatherings were canceled and people started staying home to avoid getting sick.

Then prices plunged after Saudi Arabia and Russia failed to agree on production cuts and instead entered a price war last Sunday. In a stunning reversal, Saudi Arabia said it would actually boost oil production and offer a massive discount for its customers.

U.S. oil companies, especially smaller ones, are now looking to make deep cuts. Industry analysts warn of possible bankruptcies, especially if oil remains where it's fallen to, in the $30 per barrel range. Companies operating in Texas's Eagle Ford Shale need prices between $40 to $60 a barrel to remain profitable.

'We were here before the oil'

Karnes City was transformed by the oil drilling boom that started about a decade back. Karnes County National Bank President Trip Ruckman says there were local farmers and ranchers who were just getting by, then all of a sudden showed up at his bank with a $1 million oil royalty check in hand.

Right now it can still look pretty busy around town. There are trucks on the roads and a few local hotels are still full. Ruckman says it takes time for drillers to wind down production plans that already were being implemented when prices collapsed.

""Probably, in a few weeks to a month or two, I think you're going to see things slow down. But we'll still be here — we were here before the oil,"" says Ruckman, who tries to stay optimistic about the financial future of his community.

There have been reports the Trump administration may be willing to help the oil industry in other ways. For example, the White House could reduce federal royalties for oil pumped on government land or offshore. The administration could also offer low-interest government-backed loans.

Groups focused on climate change have criticized such ideas.

""The last people who deserve taxpayers' money are the billionaires that created and profited from the climate crisis,"" says Jack Shapiro of the environmental group Greenpeace.

One potential bright spot in all this is gasoline prices. Lower oil prices will mean cheaper gas for motorists in coming months.

Usually when gas prices go down people drive more and choose bigger cars, which increases consumption. But with many limiting travel out of concern over the coronavirus, this time might be the exception.",real

President of the UFC he may be, but White isn’t averse to being the butt of a joke now and then.

He proved that on Saturday when he tweeted a hilarious video at ‘The Notorious’ McGregor, which featured the fiery Dubliner initially as a crocodile menacing the waters before he emerges as a bull raging through the streets, running after spectators and tossing them over walls with big punches - before finally landing a huge right-hook on 50-year-old Dana himself.

The video, which has actually been doing the rounds online for some time, is backed by some riotous UFC commentary of some of McGregor’s most famous and controversial moments.

It also features a slightly tubby schoolkid sobbing in terror as the Notorious pops up at his car window and screams at him with his famous pre-fight war cry.

All told, it’s been an interesting weekend so far for McGregor, who earlier in the day tweeted out his rankings for the greatest MMA fighter of all time - but didn’t put himself as number one - well, not yet anyway.

The pandemic has claimed 1,074 lives in India, according to the Indian Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.

The Covid-19 lockdown has had an impact across business sectors. Digital payments platforms are also witnessing a number of challenges in terms of bookings in the entertainment and travel sectors. However, the lockdown due to the pandemic has also opened up new opportunities for digital payments companies. India’s major digital payment firm Paytm, for instance, has seen an increase in medical and insurance payments, among others.

Paytm's Senior Vice-President Amit Veer told Sputnik that the company has experienced a surge in online gaming, OTT content and video apps. He also said with Paytm being a homegrown Indian company, the new Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) policy will not have any bearing on it, explaining that the country's new FDI policy bars any investment from Chinese firms into an Indian company without permission from the Central government.

Sputnik: Has Paytm seen any significant increase in digital payments as a result of RBI’s suggestion for people to use digital modes of payment due to social distancing?

Amit Veer: During the ongoing lockdown, we are seeing increased adoption of digital payments for essential payments such as recharges, utility payments, insurance premiums, among others. In fact, more users are relying on varied payment use-cases available on the Paytm app and our teams are ensuring to increase the partnerships. We are confident more Indians will now understand the convenience of digital payments and develop the habit as well.

Sputnik: So what is the company’s experience in terms of data on digital transactions?

Amit Veer: India is embracing digital payments and making it part of their lives and a life-long habit. During the lockdown period, people have been making digital payments. We have seen a 30 percent increase in groceries and the same increase in payments in pharmacies. A 15 percent increase in spending for milk has been seen. As far as the user base is concerned, we have seen a 200 percent growth in the user base during the lockdown. Also, Paytm's had 50000 new sign-ups take place every day. Between 22 March and 15 April, 90 kilograms of gold have been purchased on the Paytm platform and 50 percent have been witnessed in insurance policy purchases. Recharges for DTH, data card and mobile have also seen growth in the period.

Sputnik: How is rural India reacting to digital payments? Please share data on new Paytm users from rural markets.

Amit Veer: Rural India is the backbone of our country and plays an integral role in India's overall growth and development. Paytm has been striving to promote financial inclusion and banking services in rural India and the results have been remarkable so far. We have expanded our services through the length and breadth of rural India. This has immensely helped during this ongoing COVID-19 crisis. More people in rural India have embraced Paytm's services during this lockdown and have been safely paying for utilities online. In fact, now they prefer scanning Paytm QR at their nearby Kirana (grocery) stores, and merchants are also happily accepting digital payments.

Sputnik: How is Paytm ensuring the smooth functioning of its businesses amid COVID-19?

Amit Veer: For us, it’s business as usual. We are working from home and doing our best to provide a seamless payment experience to our country. In fact, we have taken various initiatives, from collecting contribution for the PM Cares Fund to feeding minimum wage workers. Many of our colleagues have also contributed their salaries to this cause. We have ensured that the many frontline workers protecting us have masks and hygiene products are available.

Sputnik: Is there any specific reason for the 200% volume increase in broadband and data card bill payments?

Amit Veer: This growth can be directly attributed to the massive increase in data consumption, as more people are working from home during the lockdown. Also, online gaming, OTT content and video apps have seen a surge in both users and per session log-in time.

Sputnik: What will be the impact of new FDI guidelines, under which government permission has to be taken for investments from Chinese firms?

Amit Veer: Being a homegrown Indian company, the new FDI policy has no impact on us. As you are aware, post our last fundraiser, we are well-capitalised to serve new-age financial services to our fellow countrymen in India and continue our journey towards India's financial inclusion.

Sputnik: With the entertainment and travel sector being impacted in the post-Covid-19 world, which are the new segments where you see growth?

Amit Veer: Paytm Insider has moved towards online events, which are gaining traction. We are confident that these two verticals will bounce back stronger.",fake
192,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/30/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus.html,2020-03-30,Ford Joins Effort to Make Ventilators,"
This briefing is no longer updating. Read the latest developments in the coronavirus outbreak here.
Ford Motor and General Electric will produce 50,000 ventilators.Ford Motor and General Electric’s health care division said on Monday that they together planned to produce 50,000 ventilators over the next 100 days to help meet the needs of hospitals during the coronavirus pandemic.
Ford plans to continue making about 30,000 ventilators a month once the initial batch has been made. Ford will use a plant in Rawsonville, Mich., and about 500 workers to make the medical devices.
Ford’s effort is the second-such initiative by a major automaker. General Motors has said it plans to make ventilators at one of its factories in Kokomo, Ind., with Ventec Life Systems, a ventilator manufacturer. Tesla, the electric car company, has also said that it intends to make ventilators with Medtronic at a factory in Buffalo.
G.E. has licensed the design of the ventilator from Airon Corporation of Melbourne, Fla. The device works on air pressure and does not need electricity, and the companies said it could be useful for most coronavirus patients who need help breathing.
Ford and G.E. said last week that Ford would help increase production of another ventilator based on a design from G.E. Healthcare.
Stocks climb but investor unease continues.Stocks on Wall Street rose on Monday as investors bid up shares of health care companies as they reported progress on products that could help with the coronavirus outbreak.
The S&P 500 climbed more than 3 percent, adding to a strong showing last week. The S&P 500 had risen 10 percent last week after a three-day run that was its best since 1933, amid relief over Washington’s $2 trillion spending plan.
Gainers on Monday included Johnson & Johnson, which said it had identified a lead candidate for a vaccine for the virus and planned to ramp up both production and clinical testing. Abbott Laboratories rose on reports that it had said a new test that could detect the virus in five minutes had been cleared for use by the Food and Drug Administration.
But there were lingering signs of caution in the financial markets. Most notably, oil prices tumbled to their lowest levels since 2002.
And in the stock market, Monday’s rally came on relatively light volume, said Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak, a trading and asset management firm. That suggests a lack of conviction among investors, he said.
“It’s a little bit of lack of confidence,” said Mr. Maley, “And you can’t blame them after what’s happened.”
Some industries continued to be battered by the long shadow of the virus. Cruise lines Royal Caribbean, Norwegian and Carnival were all down 10 percent, making them some of the worst performers in the S&P 500 on Monday. United Airlines, American Airlines and Boeing, all of which had rallied last week on expectations that they would benefit from government assistance, also fell sharply.
The dizzying moves that characterized trading in financial markets for most of March seem to have ended as policymakers around the world moved to bolster their economies with spending and other means of support. But investors were weighing those efforts against the rising number of coronavirus cases and the redoubled efforts to contain the pandemic.
President Trump on Sunday extended guidelines on social distancing and nonessential travel in the United States, an admission that there is no certainty around when the spreading coronavirus epidemic will end.
In the oil market, brent crude, the international benchmark, fell more than 6 percent to roughly $26 a barrel on Monday. West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark, was down more than 5 percent with prices hovering around $20.25 in early afternoon trading. Earlier in the morning the price had briefly dropped below $20 a barrel, a level not seen in almost 20 years.
Oil has also been hammered by a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia, two of the largest oil producers, but analysts say that it is far outweighed by the collapse in demand caused by the pandemic.
FGE, a consulting firm, recently estimated that demand for April would fall by 17 million barrels a day — to about 17 percent lower than usual — as airplanes are grounded, road traffic falls sharply and factories are shuttered.
Misleading coronavirus videos posted by Brazil’s president are pulled down.Facebook and Twitter took down posts featuring Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, over the past two days after he claimed that the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine was a “cure everywhere” for the coronavirus and called for an end to social distancing and shelter-in-place measures in Brazil.
Mr. Bolsonaro had posted the videos, which showed him talking to street vendors in the Taguatinga district of Brasília, Brazil’s capital, to Twitter, Facebook and Instagram on Sunday. The New York Times has reported that there is no proof that the drug is effective against the virus.
Twitter took down the videos on Sunday. The videos on Facebook and Instagram were taken down on Monday evening. The companies said the posts violated their policies for spreading misinformation that could also lead to physical harm.
But the moves were unusual for the tech companies, which have long been hesitant to remove posts from world leaders, even when they walk the line of disinformation. The companies have said posts from world leaders are newsworthy.
Twitter deleted a post by President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela last week, in which Mr. Maduro promoted a “brew” that he claimed could cure coronavirus. President Trump has previously posted that hydroxychloroquine showed “tremendous promise,” which the social media companies said did not violate their policies because there was not a clear call to action that would cause the public any harm.
Macy’s has lost the ‘majority’ of its sales.
Macy’s, which also owns Bloomingdale’s and Bluemercury, said on Monday that it had lost “the majority” of its sales because of store closures, which started March 18 and would persist until the retailer had a “clear line of sight on when it is safe to reopen.”
The company said it will furlough the majority of its employees this week and would maintain the “absolute minimum work force needed to maintain basic operations,” according to a statement. There will be fewer furloughs of employees supporting the digital business at call centers and distribution centers. Macy’s had 125,000 part-time and full-time employees at the end of last year.
The move shows the strain that the pandemic is placing on retailers selling goods that are considered nonessential. Many department stores and mall chains had already been weakened in recent years by the rise of e-commerce and a drop in foot traffic at malls. A complete closure of stores is dealing a new blow.
Macy’s said that it had already stopped capital spending and paying a dividend. It has also drawn down its line of credit and canceled some orders.
Retail workers have been affected across the board. L Brands, which owns Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works, said it would furlough most store staff and “those who are not currently working to support the online businesses or who cannot work from home” starting April 5.
Gap, which also owns Old Navy and Banana Republic, said on Monday it would furlough nearly 80,000 store employees in the United States and Canada.
On Wednesday, April 1, many monthly bills will come due, and households and businesses across the nation will struggle to make their payments.
Residents won’t make rent, and small businesses will have to forgo lease payments. Even the multibillion-dollar Cheesecake Factory has told landlords not to expect an April check.
The trajectory of the U.S. economy largely depends on how many bills go unpaid. The money from the $2 trillion relief package that President Trump recently signed into law will be distributed too late to help many.
Homeowners will have to choose between rent or electricity. Businesses could start laying off workers.
“These are cascades that, once they get going, are very hard to stop,” said Claudia Sahm, head of macroeconomic policy for the Washington Center for Equitable Growth. “You’re already seeing it.”
New York’s attorney general has questions for Zoom about privacy and security.Zoom, the popular videoconferencing app whose traffic has surged amid the coronavirus pandemic, is under scrutiny by the office of New York’s attorney general, Letitia James, for its data privacy and security practices.
The attorney general’s office sent a letter to Zoom on Monday asking what, if any, new security measures the company had put in place to handle increased traffic on its network and to detect hackers, according to a copy reviewed by The New York Times.
The letter referred to Zoom as “an essential and valuable communications platform,” but it outlined several concerns, noting that the company had been slow to address security flaws such as vulnerabilities that have allowed malicious users to invade videoconferences held on the service, a practice known as Zoombombing.
Instacart shoppers are staging a walkout over safety concerns.
In a sign of workers’ growing anxiety as the coronavirus pandemic rages, thousands of drivers and shoppers for the grocery delivery service Instacart walked off the job on Monday, demanding greater pay and better access to paid leave and cleaning material.
Though the size of the walkout was unclear, organizers said they believed that thousands of the company’s 200,000 shoppers, who work as independent contractors, were refusing to work. Their hope is to pressure the company by adding to the backlogs the service was already experiencing, as locked-down Americans have opted to get their daily staples delivered rather than venture out to stores.
The strike appeared to be having some effect on Monday. Ryan Hartson, an Instacart worker in Chicago, shared a screenshot from his Instacart app showing that many time slots were available for shoppers to pick up groceries, suggesting that the supply of workers was smaller than usual.
“Our team has had an unwavering commitment to prioritize the health and safety of the entire Instacart community,” Nilam Ganenthiran, president of Instacart, said in a statement. “We’ve been evaluating the Covid-19 crisis minute-by-minute to provide real-time support for Instacart shoppers and customers.”
As for Monday’s action, “we’ve seen absolutely no impact to Instacart’s operations,” a company spokeswoman said.
Catch up: Here’s what else is happening.American Airlines plans to apply for some of the $50 billion airline bailout included in the federal stimulus that was signed into law last week, its chief executive and president said in a memo to staff.

General director, president and CEO Anthony Freud made the announcement on Thursday morning, noting that all public performances and events slated through June 30 have been moved to upcoming seasons.

The U.S. debut of Paris’ Théâtre du Châtelet production of “42nd Street” (originally set for May 29-June 21) has been moved to the spring of the 2021-2022 season. Stephen Mear will return to direct.

The midwest premiere of Jeanine Tesori and Tazewell Thompson’s “Blue” (originally set for June 16-28) at The Yard at Chicago Shakespeare Theater will move to January 2021. Enrique Mazzola, Lyric’s music director designate will conduct. Also, the Chicago premiere of “Proving Up” has been moved to a later season to be announced at a future date.

“We are very disappointed to have to postpone the rest of the season, especially a beloved and uplifting title like ‘42nd Street,’ which offers pure entertainment of the kind we’re all craving. We couldn’t be more grateful for the outpouring of support that we’ve received from our patrons. All of these cancellations have a financial impact on the company and the show of support from our audiences and artists is profoundly appreciated,” Freud said in a statement.

This follows the announcement in March that the three full “Ring” cycles (an event 10 years in the making) set to begin performances April 13, as well as two performances of “Götterdämmerung” scheduled for April 4 and April 11, have been canceled.

Ticket holders for all performances are being contacted about their options.

In addition, tickets to Lyric’s annual Family Day event (scheduled for May 16) will be honored on May 22, 2021. Backstage tour tickets set for May and June will be honored in the fall; dates and more information will be announced in the coming months.",real

Zipping past pedestrians during a run or lifting weights at the gym right after someone else are things of the past, with socially distanced running routes and at-home workouts becoming more mainstream.

But if you find yourself with extra time on your hands and the sudden urge to channel your coronavirus anxiety into breaking a sweat, make sure you’re doing so safely. Because, yes, there is such a thing as getting too much exercise. And overdoing it could actually do more harm than good, pandemic or otherwise.

What is the right amount of exercise during the coronavirus crisis?

The standard exercise recommendations are simple: Adults should be getting at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity every week (like brisk walking), and do muscle-strengthening activities two days per week, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. You can, of course, mix the moderate physical activity with more vigorous exercise like running.

You might logically assume that more exercise is better because you have more time on your hands, but that’s not really the case. Benefits top out at about 300 minutes per week.

“Whatever your regular exercise routine was, I wouldn’t alter it because of COVID-19 per se,” says Linda S. Pescatello, a kinesiology professor at the University of Connecticut.

Chris Travers, an exercise physiologist at Cleveland Clinic Sports Health, points out that any amount of exercise is better than none. Research shows that even a five-minute walk or run is helping improve your cardiovascular system, and that you can do a total body strength program in seven minutes, he says.

How can I tell if I’m exercising too much?

You can experience a host of symptoms when overexercising. These include:

Loss of appetite

Headache

Muscle soreness and tenderness

Fatigue (not during, but later)

Injury

Higher pulse (10 or more beats) the day after exercising

Irritability

Difficulty concentrating

Reduced self-esteem

Weakened immune system

Beyond roughly 300 minutes of working out, you’re probably not gaining much more benefit anyway, says Robert Sallis, co-director of the Sports Medicine Fellowship at Kaiser Permanente.

The overarching rule is to “listen to your body,” Travers says. It’s OK to skip a day if you’re feeling fatigued.

If you’re feeling severe symptoms such as dizziness, chest pain or fainting, seek medical attention.

Am I more susceptible to the new coronavirus if I exercise too much?

It’s still too soon to make any kind of definitive determination.

Pescatello cautions that while it’s unclear if you could be more susceptible, you wouldn’t want to put yourself in a position of weakening your immune system, given the unknowns.

Though studies aren’t available for COVID-19, we know other viruses are much less likely to affect humans who exercise regularly, Sallis says.

David Nieman, a biology department professor at Appalachian State University, says people shouldn’t even be thinking about overtraining (more than 300 minutes per week) right now.

Existing research data supports the view that overtraining isn’t recommended in parts of the world where COVID-19 transmission risk is high.

“Intense exercise when infected with COVID-19 or other systemic viruses should be avoided,” Nieman says in a review paper coming out in June in the Journal of Sport and Health Science. The U.S. has more than 1 million coronaviruses cases, per Johns Hopkins data.

Now more than ever, though, physical activity is important to strengthen immune function and combat psychological stressors associated with the pandemic.

“Exercise is our best medicine to try to combat those,” Sallis says.

I typically don’t exercise. How can I start safely?

Remember that fitness levels vary person to person. That 150-minute threshold might be too much if you’re starting out, Pescatello says.

Just lacing up your running sneakers won’t turn you into Olympic champion Usain Bolt. In fact, trying a new exercise at a high intensity could prove dangerous.

“You’re not going to improve your physical fitness in a day, but you could hurt yourself in a day,” Travers says. He normally advises patients to walk before they run — literally.

On the flip side: What if your typical exercise routine is gone because of pandemic restrictions? Keep in mind that activities as basic as going for a walk could prove beneficial. Activities like tennis, hiking and bike riding are other socially distanced options to consider for exercise.

You’ll be thankful later. Nieman thinks this epidemic is a wake-up call to the world to reverse trends of obesity and lack of exercise to keep immune systems in solid shape.

“We can do a lot with exercise and leanness to help fend off the virus, or if we get it, to reduce the symptoms and the duration of the symptoms,” Nieman says.

I’ve been training for a race. Should I still run the distance?

You can continue to train for that race you were getting excited about. Alternatively, you can find an event for this fall and start training again.

If you opt to run your distance anyway, see if you can participate in the event virtually if a race is taking that approach. It won’t be the same as you planned, but it’s still a way to achieve that goal.

Remember, though, that running a full marathon can prove a great strain on a body. Nieman recommends people don’t train for a marathon (a 26.2-mile race) until the virus is under control.

So what’s the major takeaway? When it comes to exercise, don’t overdo it, but don’t do nothing. Regular daily exercise gives a boost to immune cells that target viruses when they enter the bloodstream, and exercise will better your mental health, too.

“You don’t really have to do a lot to get these tremendous (exercise) benefits,” Sallis says.

702,https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-rally-makes-sense-despite-bad-us-economy-coronavirus-2020-5,2020-05-08,The stock market's recent surge makes sense if you actually look at the US economy,"A number of stories have emerged pointing out a supposed disconnect between ""Main Street"" — the US economy which is being hit by the pandemic — and Wall Street — which has seen stocks rally.

But there are signs that the US economy has already bottomed and activity is starting to come back.

And since equities are forward looking, the gradual recovery of the stock market actually makes sense.

Does that mean things in the economy are good? Of course not. But stocks tend to get better before the economy is ""good.""

Neil Dutta is head of economics at Renaissance Macro Research.

This is an opinion column. The thoughts expressed are those of the author.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

With the stock market rallying sharply off its March 23 low, the usual cries have started: stocks are missing the economic reality, they're whistling by the graveyard, they're completely divorced from economic fundamentals.

In the last week: the Economist claims ""A dangerous gap has opened between America's stock market and the real economy."" Noted economic pundit Mohamed El-Erian argued that the ""Market keeps distancing itself from the economy."" But that is not so surprising early on.

Admittedly, current economic conditions are poor. Economic output has cratered, leaving widespread joblessness in its wake.

But this does not necessarily mean equity prices should be substantially lower than they are now. The US equity market is not about whether economic conditions are good or bad. Rather, what matters is whether conditions are improving or getting worse.

Today, the evidence is mounting that economic conditions, while far from good, are starting to improve. This is why stocks are up.

Hitting the bottom

Generally speaking, economic conditions can be thought of in two ways: momentum and level of activity. The momentum in the economy represents how quickly conditions are changing in relation to the past while level of activity in the economy measures how far conditions are from their historical averages.

For instance, the US can add thousands of jobs — that shows positive momentum — while the unemployment rate — the level — remains well above its historically average. Momentum needs to be positive in order for the level of activity to improve.

Consider the period following the 2009 recession. It took many years for the level of economic activity to return to potential, as the chart below demonstrates. Even as potential growth repeatedly got revised down, the level of growth hit potential sometime in 2017. Still, this period was an especially good one for stock prices even if for many, it ""didn't feel like"" a recovery.

Today, the evidence is mounting that the level of activity has bottomed – that is, conditions are not getting any worse – and the momentum in the economy has picked up somewhat.

Motor gasoline demand bottomed for the week ending April 10 and has been climbing, retracing about one-third of its decline since mid-March.

Mortgage purchase applications also bottomed for the week ending April 10, similarly recouping about 40 percent of its plunge since mid-March.

Passenger screenings at our nation's airports are also on the mend. The count is now about double the April 14 low, but still 93% off its year-ago level.

Notice that the timing of this improvement precedes the formal lifting of shelter-in-place orders for nearly all states. Thus, it stands to reason that there is room for at least some improvement once formal lockdowns end.

Of course, there are risks to the outlook. Double-dips in the economy are usually about policy choices. Almost always, double-dips are about policy choices after a recovery starts.

For example, in 1982, the economy saw a deep recession after a brief recovery because the Federal Reserve tightened interest rates to take on inflation. In the case of the coronavirus pandemic, the policy choice would be to shut parts of the economy down if the virus spread gets worse.

That said, markets have rallied for good reason and the message from stocks is not all that different from what I see in the economy. Economic conditions are no longer getting worse and the re-opening is likely to be measured. Still, we see modest improvement across a range of metrics.

Does that mean things in the economy are good? Of course not. But stocks tend to get better before the economy is ""good.""",real

As Alexander Hamilton said : “Every act of a delegated authority, contrary to the tenor of the commission under which it is exercised, is void. No legislative act, therefore, contrary to the Constitution, can be valid. To deny this would be to affirm that the deputy is greater than his principal; that the servant is above his master; that the representatives of the people are superior to the people themselves; that men acting by virtue of powers, may do not only what their powers do not authorize, but what they forbid.”

Meanwhile New York’s Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) announced Wednesday, April 22, 2020, that Mayor Bloomberg is stepping in to help create an “army” of contact tracers to help determine how many people have been exposed to the new coronavirus.

It is reasonable to ask if contact tracing is practicable or even necessary. In the few areas in which randomized testing has occurred, as many a 20% of the population have antibodies, indicating they have or have recovered from the disease. Nationwide, that means nearly everyone has had contact with the disease, even if they didn’t catch it.

According to the Stanford study, the number of “silent” or asymptomatic cases outnumber the acute cases requiring hospitalization by up to 90 to 1. By simple math, the mortality rate of COVID-19 is on the order of 0.1% – comparable to that of the seasonal flu.

The number of infections spread by one person, the R0 factor, has fallen to 0.8, . Any value less than one means the infection rate will fall slowly as quickly as it increased in the early stages, when it reached about 1.3 nationwide. Estimates of a value of 2.5 to nearly 6 were never realized.

Contact Tracing

We hear a lot about widespread testing and contact tracing. It’s time to look at possible implications, approaching that of a new world order. Contact tracing involves the identification of persons who were exposed to a coronavirus victim. In practice, each of these would be contacted by health department officials, personal information on each household collected, and put into a database. In principle, the entire household could be subject to an enforced 14-day quarantine. It is likely they would be asked to identify others with whom they had contact, ad infinity. In just a few iterations of these contacts, the entire country could be placed in lockdown.

The “Get Out of Jail” card would be proof that an individual had recovered from coronavirus and had antibodies to prove it (another round of testing). As proposed by Dr Fauci and the CDC, this proof would enable you to return to work, and to move freely in public (i.e., buy and sell). Bill Gates and Google are developing iPhone apps which would identify you as “safe,” and probably your contact tracing information as well.

These apps would trace your movements via GPS and cell tower and make that information available to public officials (and hackers, no doubt). This “permit” to be in public would not be guaranteed. The “experts” on the coronavirus task force are hinting that immunity may be only temporary, and that you can still be contagious weeks or months after contracting the disease. Testing free of the disease does not mean you can’t acquire an infection within days or hours of the testing.

This scheme correlates well with the concept of regional startups. While the coronavirus has had less impact on some locations than others, the infection can spread very rapidly from a single source. This means travel between locations could be restricted. The granularity of these regions extends to the county and city level, so each supervisor or mayor could have wide reaching authority to restrict movement in and out of his domain.

Small wonder that mayors of New York, Chicago and other major cities are already exercising their authority. It extends down to the village level, where mayors in Chicago’s North Shore, even Mundelein, are issuing “executive orders” on related issues.

How long before people seek favor from officials by denouncing their neighbors? Oh wait! Didn’t New York and Chicago invite cell phone videos exposing violators. We got along just fine with land line telephones for over 100 years. If the government tries wide-scale cell phone tracking, many will leave their phone at home, turn it off, or put it into an RF blocking pouch. Be aware that Google can track you, even if you’re not using a Google app at the time.

From Pandemic to Totalitarianism

Rosemary Frei, a freelance medical writer and journalist for 22 years with a MSc in molecular biology from a faculty of medicine, now an independent investigative journalist in Toronto, Ontario, wrote the following article on April 23, 2020, The Seven-Step Path from Pandemic to Totalitarianism, with a template for rolling it out. This article presents a dystopian, yet entirely plausible view of the future of our culture.

With the arrival of COVID-19 many countries quickly completed Steps 1, 2 and 3. Step 4 is well under way in many jurisdictions, with other jurisdictions about to start Step 5 in early May.

As if it were planned for in advance, billions of people around the globe are being forced step by rapid step into a radically different way of life, one that involves far less personal, physical and financial freedom.

Freedom and the American People

The American people seem so willing to give up their freedoms in order to avoid a potential health threat, even if it costs millions of people their livelihood and this nation its economy. We’ve experienced other health threat over the past two decades, and we didn’t carry on as if the sky was falling.

If there’s one thing we all knew even before the Chinese unleashed their latest virus on the world, it’s that politicians crave power. Over the past couple of months, America’s governors and mayors have tasted it and they want even more than they want their Big Mac’s.

Now that they’ve seen how complacent we’ve become – wearing our silly masks, shopping at dawn in hope of finding toilet paper on the shelves, queuing up outside markets to be allowed in one at a time, not hugging one another, not even shaking hands – many politicians are feeling a drug-like induced exuvberate over their new found power and control.

Not to be forgotten: Once freedom is lost it is difficult to win back, but confiscating additional freedoms become easier with each further assault on our freedoms.

He has a background in the life sciences, and graduated from the University of Glasgow with a degree in genetics

The UK government was one of many that reacted to the coronavirus outbreak based on worst-case scenario predictions. But the author of an alternative model has restated her position, saying the virus is already “on its way out.”

Sunetra Gupta is a professor of theoretical epidemiology at the University of Oxford. Back in March, before the UK’s lockdown, she and her team published a study suggesting that the coronavirus may have infected 50% of the British population back in early March, before the lockdown measures were put in place. The model concluded that continuing on a path toward herd immunity would be the most sensible course of action.

Also on rt.com ‘Humans are not herds’: WHO thrashes ‘brutal arithmetic’ of herd immunity to beat Covid-19 pandemic

Boris Johnson’s government originally chose to aim for a model like Prof. Gupta’s, just as those notorious irrational hotheads the Swedes were. It soon, however, gave in to public (read: Twitter) pressure. Boris called in that professional harbinger of doom, Imperial College’s Neil Ferguson, instead.

A tale of two models

Prof. Ferguson’s model was nothing short of apocalyptic, featuring as it did half a million dead, and bodies piled up in car parks outside hospitals – everything but a yawning crevice in the ground and satyrs raining hell from the sky. So stark was the warning that he seemed to take it to heart, deciding to treasure a few moments with his married mistress while he could. For this small indulgence, he was eventually forced to resign from his post. But his thinking informs the government’s coronavirus policy to this day.

Read more

Prof. Gupta’s model, on the other hand, predicted that just 1 in 1,000 of those infected with Covid-19 would need to go to hospital, and possibly an order of magnitude less. This would have placed the true mortality rate at 0.1% or lower, something much more like the flu and much less like a Hollywood disaster movie. Today, almost two months on, the problem with all of this is pretty much the same as it was then: we just don’t have enough information.

One body of evidence that has built up since, however, is a number of studies involving ‘antibody tests’ that have been conducted around the world. The basic idea is that, if you have recovered from Covid-19, your immune system’s battle with the virus will have left a trace of antibodies in your blood.

Assuming that the antibody studies are more or less accurate, it would appear that Ferguson, and not Gupta, was closest to the truth. They show that even in badly hit countries, something like only 5-10% of people have antibodies. So has Professor Gupta repented, pledging allegiance to the new church of Ferguson-ology, whose teachings now determine our lives?

Sticking to her guns

Anything but. In her first interview since the original study was published, Prof. Gupta doubles down on her opinion that the coronavirus is not as bad as all that. Firstly, she reminds us how “a lot of these antibody tests are extremely unreliable.” Like everything with coronavirus, there are caveats attached: we just don’t know how accurately these tests detect antibodies in people who have been infected.

Prof. Gupta also points to the total absence of a pattern across countries with wildly different lockdown strategies as being highly suggestive of “hidden” herd immunity. “In almost every context we’ve seen the epidemic grow, turn around and die away – almost like clockwork. Different countries have had different lockdown policies, and yet what we’ve observed is almost a uniform pattern of behaviour.”

In other words, it doesn’t matter what governments do or not in reaction to the virus, as it had already been spreading freely through their countries for at least a month longer than they had assumed.

Also on rt.com The man behind the UK’s Covid-19 lockdown has screwed his mistress, screwed us all, & now – thankfully – screwed his career

She continues: “To me, that suggests that much of the driving force here was due to the build-up of immunity … I think that the epidemic has largely come and is on its way out in this country.” Prof. Gupta is magnanimous, and while noting that “the jury is still out,” she says Prof. Ferguson’s model, while definitely being a “worst case scenario,” was possible, even if it was not plausible.

As if to put the tin hat on her dismantling of the government’s actions to this point, Prof. Gupta warns that the socially distant lockdowns are in fact precisely the conditions that put more people at risk of dying. “Remaining in a state of lockdown is extremely dangerous from the point of view of the vulnerability of the entire population to new pathogens. Effectively we used to live in a state approximating lockdown 100 years ago, and that was what created the conditions for the Spanish Flu to come in and kill 50 million people.”

The full interview is well worth listening to, especially as Prof. Ferguson is no longer gracing the airwaves with his opinions. His model was done at Imperial College London – a very great university, no doubt. But the modellers at the University of Oxford report are hardly dunces either. Make up your own mind as to who was closer to the truth. Hopefully, history will bear it out; after all, it is usually written by the victors.

The nation's banking regulator has indicated that growth in the current financial year (April 2020 - March 2021) will remain in the negative.

Despite facing a revenue crunch itself due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Indian Finance Ministry has said that there is no proposal to impose a calamity cess to higher revenues in the fight against the pandemic.

Sources in the ministry said that given the economic scenario amid the pandemic, an additional cess will be an ""adversity"" in itself.

A source in the Ministry of Finance said that a proposal like this would prove to be counter-productive, as with the varying degrees of lockdown across the country, sales are already at low volume. Indian PM Narendra Modi imposed the lockdown on 25 March. The national lockdown will continue until 31 May, with some relaxation to industrial, construction, and other service sectors.

""Industry is already facing a deep crisis for want of demand and likely labour challenges that might come in near future due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, tinkering with the taxes or cess would not be a prudent option at all"", the source added.

The Indian government has taken a massive hit to its revenues because of the COVID-19 pandemic, so much so that it has not released the monthly collections of Goods and Services Tax (GST) for the month of April. In March, the Indian government brought in revenue worth $13 billion.

A Finance Ministry official told Sputnik, ""There has been a very bad impact on GST revenue for the month of April"". The official said that April GST revenue is down by at least 66 percent compared with March.

Due to the impact of the pandemic the ministry is staring at a revenue gap on both direct as well indirect tax collection for the current financial year. The net tax target of $218.12 billion planned in the budget on 1 Feb is difficult to achieve now, contends the ministry official.

However, to compensate for losses on account of the pandemic-led slowdown, the Indian government has recently enhanced this year's borrowing from the budgeted $104 million to $160 million.",fake

The $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief package marks the largest rescue package in American history. President Trump announced Wednesday that it includes $300 billion in direct payments to individuals to alleviate at least a little of the financial pain caused by the deliberate near-standstill of the U.S. economy.

But despite promises that the one-time funds will be distributed ""within the next three weeks,"" it will likely be months before the stimulus checks hit bank accounts according to experts.

Under the plan, single people earning incomes below $75,000 will receive as much as $1,200 as ""direct payments into most people's deposit accounts,"" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said at a news briefing on Wednesday.

Married couples would get $2,400, and parents would receive $500 for each child under age 17. About 90% of households — approximately 165 million — would benefit from the checks, according to the Tax Policy Center.

Payments would be phased out beyond those income limits, and people making more than $99,000 will not be eligible at all.

How soon can I expect my check?

""It really depends on what information the IRS has on you,"" Kyle Pomerleau, a resident fellow at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute, told NPR.

That's because the infusion of cash will be distributed by the IRS, so those who have previously received tax refunds via direct deposit will be first in line for the rebate checks. Pomerleau, estimates the earliest those payments will go out is three to four weeks after the package is approved.

Alternatively, people who receive tax refunds through the mail will have to hold out much longer.

""I don't think physical checks will be in the mail for another three to four months,"" Pomerleau said, citing delays in the system in 2008 when the government last issued national stimulus payments under the George W. Bush administration.

Back then the financial relief package was signed into law in February but the delivery date for people whose checks were sent through the mail was somewhere between May and July.

There's another group who may have an even longer wait: Those who receive tax refunds in the mail and have moved since filing 2018 taxes.

""So far there's no information on how [the IRS is] going to handle that,"" he said.

What if I didn't file 2018 taxes?

Pomerleau says nonfilers, including recent college graduates, and those who didn't file 2018 taxes because they had no obligation, ""would be left out unless they hurry up and file a return for 2019.""

Americans receiving Social Security benefits are also on file with the government and their payments will be based on those records, he added.

What if I made more than $99,000 in 2018 or 2019?

Those who earned more than $99,000 are not totally shut out from the massive relief package if they expect to make less than that sum in the coming year.

The IRS will allow tax filers to qualify for the relief aid next year, when filing 2020 taxes.

""That of course is no good for someone who needs to pay their bills today,"" Pomerleau said, ""but all is not lost.""

Other holdups

Janet Holtzblatt, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, suspects the IRS's infrastructure, or lack thereof, will create even more delays for desperate people.

In the past it has taken several months for the government to develop, test and install the kind of software necessary to launch a rebate program. But it is unclear, what if anything, the administration has done behind the scenes so far.

""It takes several months to get a program like this up and moving,"" Holtzblatt told NPR.

""I hope that they've been building their infrastructure in the days between when they first announced they were going to do this and the day of enactment,"" she said, adding that in 2008, the process took at least three months.

Impact of COVID-19 on the IRS

Another unknown factor, that Holtzblatt says needs to be considered is how the COVID-19 disease is going to affect the capacity of the IRS staff to ensure the timely delivery of the payments.

As she noted in a recent blog post:

All of that may slow distribution of the payments, Holtzblatt said.

She cautioned the public to be patient: ""The IRS will be overburdened and there will be lots of taxpayer confusion ... and all this will collide with the processing of 2019 returns. There will be snafus.""",real
564,https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2020/5/2/21244748/cubs-chicago-coronavirus-wrigley-field-2020,2020-05-02,The Cubs have seen it all over the years — and that’s just on the second day of May,"Of all the dates in the history of the Chicago Cubs, May 2 is one of them.

I know. Try to hold on to your hats after that explosive opening sentence.

Look, the Cubs have been around since Methuselah. Any date on the calendar is rich with history about their exploits, many of them not so wonderful.

But there’s something about May 2 . . .

Where to start? On this date in 1917, Cubs lefty Hippo Vaughn threw a nine-inning no-hitter against the Reds at Weeghman Park, which eventually would become Wrigley Field. One slight problem: Reds righty Fred Toney also threw a no-hitter, and his lasted for 10 innings. Indeed, the Cubs lost, in the only double-no-no of its kind ever.

On this date in 1956, Cubs third baseman Don Hoak struck out six times against the New York Giants at Wrigley. It remains tied in the big-league record book for the most strikeouts in a single game — only Hoak made his achievement extra special by fanning against six different Giants pitchers. Sure, it took him 17 innings to make all that magic happen, but the man was determined.

But this isn’t all about bad outcomes, in case you were beginning to wonder. May 2 has seen, for one thing, a bunch of walk-off winners by the Cubs at Wrigley.

In 1958, they beat the Milwaukee Braves 8-7 on Walt Moryn’s ninth-inning homer. Official attendance that day: 5,751.

Two years later, the Cubs gave up three runs to the Phillies in the top of the ninth, falling behind 7-5. But they responded with three of their own, winning the game when Don Zimmer knocked home Ernie Banks with a single to center. Attendance: 2,807.

In 1978, the Wrigley ramps were darn near overrun by an official crowd of — wait for it — 6,990. When Manny Trillo doubled off the Dodgers’ Mike Garman to score Rudy Meoli with the game-winner in the ninth . . . bedlam, we’re sure.

Maybe, just maybe, there was even more excitement on the second of May in 1998, when 38,430 cheered as Sammy Sosa doubled to deep left off Kent Bottenfield with two outs in the ninth to score Mark Grace from first and defeat the rival Cardinals.

Could we look back on most any day from April into September and find moments like these? Perhaps. But try telling that to the great Billy Williams, who on May 2, 1961, went 4-for-4 with a grand slam against the Giants. You can bet he still remembers a day that fine, and probably many more folks than were actually in the puny crowd of 3,334 claimed to be there to witness it.

In 1976, the Cubs won each game of a doubleheader at San Francisco in extra innings — the teams played 14 and 11, respectively. And not only that, but the games ended with identical scores of 6-5. What a crazy turn of events that was.

But the man who drove home the winning run in the second game of that doubleheader — terrific Cub Randy Hundley — couldn’t recall that at-bat when reached this week at his home in Palatine. For the record, it was a pinch-hit sacrifice fly off Greg Minton that scored Dave Rosello.

“I sure don’t,” Hundley said. “But I wasn’t playing much by then anyway. My legs were giving out on me.”

It’s true. That was the very last RBI of Hundley’s career.

Hundley, now 78, sure wishes he could be watching baseball now. He rarely misses a Cubs game in person or, more often, on TV. In non-pandemic times, mind you.

“This virus is something incredible, isn’t it?” he said. “Who would’ve ever thought of such a thing?”

Who could’ve imagined it, say, one year ago today? Last May 2, the Cubs were off after winning four straight on the road against the Diamondbacks and Mariners. A day later, they’d begin a three-game sweep of the first-place Cardinals at Wrigley, by the end of which the Cubs would have a half-game lead in the division. The Cubs would remain atop for the remainder of the month.

On that pleasant note, hey, enjoy the rest of your May 2. And be ready — you never know what might happen.",real

Press TV, Barcelona

Barcelona may still be under a strict lockdown amidst the coronavirus pandemic, but a young drummer is out on a protest with the family nonetheless, and they want an end to the lockdown.

The protest, dubbed “Deconfining Rights and Freedoms,” was organized by a pro-independence group called the October 3 Platform. Koki Grassiot, one of the founders, says they have been organizing such rallies online during the lockdown. Their previous petitions to protest were turned down by the Spanish Ministry of the Interior for health reasons, until today.

The protesters say the current health crisis and its economic fallout are the result of years of overreach by the central governments in Madrid.

Similar protests have kicked off across Spain in recent weeks, allegedly pushed by the conservatives and far right to bring down the left-leaning coalition executive.

Barcelona will move to phase one of the Spanish deconfinement plan and that includes partially reopening more businesses, retail stores and restaurants. Residents are required to wear face coverings in public spaces, beaches remain open only for limited hours while sunbathing is prohibited.

Whatever may have triggered the anti-lockdown protests, they seem to reflect the same concerns: the distress many feel as they try to cope with the coronavirus and the fear of what may lie ahead.",fake

Taiwan has complained of increased Chinese military harassment since the coronavirus pandemic began, with fighter jets and naval vessels regularly approaching the island on drills China has described as routine.

China says Taiwan is its most sensitive and important territorial issue, and has never renounced the use of force to bring what it views as a Chinese province under its control, making the Taiwan Strait a potential military flashpoint.

Li, in his state-of-the-nation work report at the start of the annual meeting of China’s parliament, said his country would “resolutely oppose and deter any separatist activities seeking Taiwan independence”.

China will improve policies and measures to encourage exchanges and cooperation across the Taiwan Strait, and protect the well-being of Taiwan’s people, he added.

“We will encourage them to join us in opposing Taiwan independence and promoting China’s reunification,” Li said. “With these efforts, we can surely create a beautiful future for the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.”

However, there was no mention of the word “peaceful” in front of “reunification”, departing from the standard expression Chinese leaders have used for at least four decades when addressing parliament and mentioning Taiwan.

Democratic Taiwan has shown no interest in being ruled by autocratic China.

A senior Taiwan official, however, told Reuters the absence of the word “peaceful” did not signal a fundamental change in China’s approach towards the island.

“They are still talking about the concept of peaceful unification, just in an indirect linguistic expression,” said the person who is familiar with Taiwan’s policy towards China, pointing to Li’s remarks on cross-Strait exchanges and economic integration.

“It’s neutral. We do not look at it that way.”

China’s Taiwan Affairs Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

China believes Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen is a separatist bent on independence. Tsai says Taiwan is already an independent country called the Republic of China, its formal name.

Speaking in Taipei on Wednesday at the inauguration of her second term, Tsai said Taiwan could not accept becoming part of China under its “one country, two systems” offer of autonomy, and rejected China’s sovereignty claims.

China wants Taiwan to accept the “one country, two systems” model, which is supposed to guarantee a high degree of autonomy and which Beijing uses to run the former British colony of Hong Kong.

However, all major Taiwanese parties have rejected it.

Responding to Li’s speech, Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council said the Taiwanese people were resolutely opposed to the “one country, two systems” proposal as it “belittles Taiwan and damages the status quo in the Taiwan Strait”.

On Friday, China proposed new legislation for Hong Kong requiring it to quickly enact national security regulations, a move some see as contradicting the “one country, two systems” concept, and swiftly condemned by Taiwan.

The father of the assailant is speaking out, saying that his son suffers from serious mental illness and was quarantined in a nursing home with at-risk elderly people after testing positive for COVID-19.

Kimberly Craig of WXYZ 7 ABC broke the insane news that shows how the most vulnerable are being put at risk due to the decisions of government bureaucrats and the so-called first responders.

“He has issues and for them to put him in a facility like that, nothing good was going to happen,” the suspect’s father said to 7 Action News.

In addition to having a history of mental illness, the assailant has an assault case that is pending in Washtenaw County. This highly dangerous individual was put around vulnerable people who he could brutalize as well as possibly infect with COVID-19.

The assailant’s father said that his son had been taken to a group home for supervision, but had a mental health relapse as he was hearing voices in his head. When he was taken to the University of Michigan Hospital for supervision as a result, he was diagnosed with COVID-19. That is when he was taken to the Westwood Nursing Center where he would commit his savage assault.

It is unknown whether or not the nursing home called the police to alert them about the assault that had taken place in their facilities. The assailant is currently in police custody, and it is yet to be determined if he will be charged for what he did.

The sickening video of the assault can be seen here:

“He never should have been housed.. quarantined with the victim that he eventually assaulted. That should have never happened,” the father said. “Someone dropped the ball.”

The person who dropped the ball may have been Governor Gretchen Whitmer, who issued a directive that forced COVID-19 patients to be housed in nursing homes.

Big League Politics reported on how state Democrats are turning on Whitmer for essentially issuing death sentences to the elderly with her incomprehensible and arguably genocidal policy prescriptions:

Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer’s heavy-handed authoritarian governance has made her a pariah throughout the state, and Democrats are starting to become frustrated with her leadership as a result. State representative Leslie Love (D-Detroit) is flabbergasted over Whitmer’s order to send coronavirus patients into nursing homes, which has resulted in an untold number of unnecessary deaths by putting the most vulnerable population at needless risk. “To return seniors into an environment, seniors with the virus still recovering from the virus, into an environment with, well, seniors, just didn’t seem — it’s not a good idea,” Love said. Whitmer made an executive order in April that mandated seniors diagnosed with COVID-19 to be placed into nursing homes, called “regional hubs,” to be around other healthy seniors. State officials claim that the policy is effective because of distance requirements that are required between the healthy and unhealthy seniors. “It’s a good move, a good step to make these regional hubs, and I think as we move forward, we have to look at making sure we’re really implementing best practices, looking to other best practices across the state,” Chief Medical Executive Joneigh S. Khaldun said. Initially, the state wanted to put the sick seniors at the TCF Center in Detroit but that became untenable after the site was shut down. This meant seniors with coronavirus were put into nursing homes among the vulnerable instead. Love is worried about individuals in nursing homes throughout the state, including her 86-year-old mother, catching the highly-infectious disease. “That would break my heart because I’ve been on the front lines of this, trying to make sure our seniors — my mother, your mother, anybody else’s mother — does not get sick and die from this, particularly if they’re in a nursing home,” Love said.

Complicit government officials like Whitmer want to keep the panic going so they cannot be held accountable for their crimes against humanity in how they have responded to the pandemic.",fake

Although sources close to the Palestinian leader told Israel Hayom newspaper that the intentions of the leader to end all cooperation with Israel and the US were ""serious"", they also stated that his assertion was mostly declarative and George Jaqman, Director of the Ramallah-based Institute for Democratic Studies, believes it is unlikely that Mahmoud Abbas will go ahead with the move.

Abbas Cries Wolf Again

""He can say whatever he wants in the media but the truth is that we simply don't know whether Abbas has a strategic plan to implement his declaration. We will only believe it if we see its practical implementation on the ground,"" Jagman explained.

However, that might prove a difficult task. Since the establishment of the Palestinian Authority in 1993, Ramallah has cooperated with Tel Aviv on various levels, including that of security, helping the Jewish state thwart major terrorist attacks.

Last November, for example, the PA allegedly handed Tel Aviv ""crucial information"" that led to the tracking and subsequent elimination of a top Islamic Jihad commander, Baha Abu Al Atta.

But the security cooperation has also helped the PA. In recent years, Hamas, which has been competing with Abbas' Fatah, has stepped up its efforts to challenge the Palestinian leadership, planning attacks on their security personnel.

According to reports, the Palestinian leader's life has also been in danger ""at least twice"" with Israel's inner spy agency the Shin Bet helping Ramallah to foil his assassination and keep the militants of Hamas and other extremist groups in check.

That's why, believes the expert, Abbas' declaration -- that has been used on a multiple occasions in the past but has never materialised -- is merely aimed at giving ""a green light"" to the Palestinians, urging them to take to the streets and clash with Israelis, hoping that the escalation of tensions would force Israel to back down from its plans to incorporate more West Bank territory.

Back to Armed Struggle?

According to a recent poll conducted by the Palestinian Centre for Policy and Survey Research, 94 percent of Palestinians expressed their strong rejection of the peace plan rolled by US President Donald Trump in January, that presupposed major land swaps and the extension of Israel's sovereignty over predominantly Palestinian areas.

The same survey found that 77 percent of respondents were supportive of the idea of ending the PA's security cooperation with Israel, whereas 64 percent said they were in favour of resorting to an armed struggle to force Tel Aviv to scrap its expansion plans.

For Jaqman, however, attempts to drive the Palestinians out to the streets are ""not realistic"" simply because the reality on the ground has changed, he believes.

""In the past, Palestinians were able to clash with Israeli soldiers face to face because Israel's security personnel was positioned inside Palestinian towns, whereas now they opt to stay on the outskirts of cities which makes it more difficult for the Palestinians to reach and confront them.""

To minimise losses, Israel has also erected a fence separating its territories from the Palestinians. The 708 kilometre-long barrier -- constructed in the wake of the Second Intifada (2000-2005) -- has managed to significantly decrease the number of Palestinian infiltrations, putting an end to a wave of terror attacks that engulfed the country in the early 2000s.

However, the implementation of security measures is far from the only factor that keeps Palestinians at home, says the pundit. In March, when the first coronavirus cases started popping up, the PA implemented a series of strict measures including a full lockdown of towns and cities to contain the spread of the pandemic, thus bringing the interaction between the Palestinian crowds and Israeli security forces to a minimum.

""Add this to the fact that the economic situation in the West Bank has deteriorated and you will understand why people will choose to refrain from an armed struggle despite polls that show overwhelming support for these tactics,"" explained Jaqman.

""The key for solving the problem and preventing Israel from going ahead with its plans lies within the Palestinian leadership, not the masses. It is only them who can stop Tel Aviv's intentions,"" he added.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu plans to hold a vote on the bill extending sovereignty over the Jordan Valley, that makes up some 30 percent of the predominantly Palestinian West Bank, in early July.

The bill will need to pass three readings before it becomes a law. If it does, the practical meaning of that would be that Israel will not only absorb some 65 thousand Palestinians who live in the area but will also gain full control over an agriculturally important piece of land which is considered pivotal for the economy of an independent Palestinian state.

Sovereignty over this area will also mean that Israel now needs to go through a long and bureaucratic procedure to approve construction and will be able to shorten these processes, enabling a relatively quick Jewish expansion.

Senator William E. Brady, the Illinois Minority leader in the state senate, introduced legislation on Wednesday that will give government the right to confiscate property from business owners who defy their lockdown orders.

Senator Brady is a Republican.

According to the proposed legislation SB3993 the government will set “safe place of business protocols” for businesses to follow to reopen.

The protocols include:

The protocols shall include:

(1) customer density limits based on business facilities’ square footage and appropriate social distancing;

(2) face covering requirements for employees; and

(3) regular cleaning regimens.

(d) The Department shall publish additional protocols for specific customer-facing businesses as necessary.

(e) A business that complies with the protocols may reopen and rehire staff at its discretion as soon as is practical.

(f) A hospital or other healthcare facility that abides by the protocols and is located in a Region with adequate intensive care unit capacity may offer the full spectrum of inpatient and outpatient care and treatment to its patients.

The Department shall conduct a public information campaign to explain hospitals’ and healthcare facilities’ safety protocols and to urge patients not to put off any necessary care.

(g) A day care center, as that term is defined under Section 2.09 of the Child Care Act of 1969, may reopen or expand its capacity at its discretion and as soon as is practical if it complies with the protocols.

The legislation then goes on to describe how the Illinois governor can confiscate personal property during a state emergency.

(20 ILCS 3305/7) (from Ch. 127, par. 1057)

Sec. 7. Emergency Powers of the Governor. (4) On behalf of this State to take possession of, and to acquire full title or a lesser specified interest in, any personal property as may be necessary to accomplish the objectives set forth in Section 2 of this Act, including: airplanes, automobiles, trucks, trailers, buses, and other vehicles; coal, oils, gasoline, and other fuels and means of propulsion; explosives, materials, equipment, and supplies; animals and livestock; feed and seed; food and provisions for humans and animals; clothing and bedding; and medicines and medical and surgical supplies; and to take possession of and for a limited period occupy and use any real estate necessary to accomplish those objectives; but only upon the undertaking by the State to pay just compensation therefor as in this Act provided, and then only under the following provisions:

a. The Governor, or the person or persons as the Governor may authorize so to do, may forthwith take possession of property for and on behalf of the State; provided, however, that the Governor or persons shall SB3993 – 5 – LRB101 21409 CPF 72043 b simultaneously with the taking, deliver to the owner or his or her agent, if the identity of the owner or agency is known or readily ascertainable, a signed statement in writing, that shall include the name and address of the owner, the date and place of the taking, description of the property sufficient to identify it, a statement of interest in the property that is being so taken, and, if possible, a statement in writing, signed by the owner, setting forth the sum that he or 0 she is willing to accept as just compensation for the property or use. Whether or not the owner or agent is known or readily ascertainable, a true copy of the statement shall promptly be filed by the Governor or the person with the Director, who shall keep the docket of the statements. In cases where the sum that the owner is willing to accept as just compensation is less than $1,000, copies of the statements shall also be filed by the Director with, and shall be passed upon by an Emergency Management Claims Commission, consisting of 3 disinterested citizens who shall be appointed by the Governor, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, within 20 days after the Governor’s declaration of a disaster, and if the sum fixed by them as just compensation be less than $1,000 and is accepted in writing by the owner, then the State Treasurer out of funds appropriated for these purposes, shall, upon certification thereof by the Emergency Management Claims Commission, cause the sum so certified forthwith to be paid to the owner. The Emergency Management Claims Commission is hereby given the power to issue appropriate subpoenas and to administer oaths to witnesses and shall keep appropriate minutes and other records of its actions upon and the disposition made of all claims.

And the lawmaker pushing this legislation is a Repubican.

Holy crap.

The Motley Fool

COVID-19 isn't just wreaking havoc on Americans' near-term finances; it's also putting their long-term financial security at risk. Not only have retirement plan values plunged since the pandemic took hold, but those who are out of work are likely pausing retirement plan contributions until their income picks back up.

If you're worried that COVID-19 will force you to delay retirement, you're not alone. But here are a few things you can do to avoid that fate.

1. Leave your existing savings alone

Passed back in March, the CARES Act was put into effect to help Americans stay afloat during this difficult time. One provision of the CARES Act is that you're now allowed to withdraw up to $100,000 from an IRA or 401(k) penalty-free, regardless of age. Normally, withdrawals are subject to a 10% penalty when they're taken prior to age 59 1/2.

Tapping your retirement savings may be tempting when you're grappling with a hit to your income. But before you go that route, try exploring other options. If you're out of work, the companies you owe money to (like your mortgage lender, auto loan servicer, and utility providers) may agree to let you defer payments for a number of months, and that could make it possible to leave your IRA or 401(k) intact. That's important, because withdrawing from your retirement savings right now, when the market is down, increases your chances of locking in losses. It also leaves you with less money on hand when you're older, which could result in a scenario where you're forced to delay retirement.

2. Keep funding your retirement plan if you're able to

If you've lost your job and are living on unemployment benefits right now, contributing to a retirement plan may not be possible. But if you still have an income and there's money left over after your basic needs are tended to, then it pays to put that cash into your retirement plan.

First of all, the more you contribute to a traditional IRA or 401(k), the more you lower your tax burden for the year. Secondly, now's a good time to pump money into a retirement plan because a lot of investments can still be snatched up on the relative cheap. Finally, maintaining your contributions will help you stay on course savings-wise, which is the ticket to getting to retire when you want to.

3. Borrow smartly as needed to avoid high-interest debt

You may reach a point in the coming weeks or months when you need to borrow money to pay your bills. And borrowing in the form of racking up a credit card balance may be the easiest way to go – but it's by no means the most affordable way to go. Credit cards tend to charge exorbitantly high interest, which means that once you accrue that type of debt, you're apt to spend so much money paying it off that there may not be enough left over to fund your retirement savings when things get better.

Rather than borrow via credit card debt, try borrowing against your home. You'll generally pay a lot less interest on a home equity loan or line of credit. If you're not a homeowner, a personal loan is a better bet than credit card debt. You stand a good chance of snagging one provided your credit score is strong.

The COVID-19 crisis is ruining a lot of people's retirement plans, but it doesn't have to wreck yours. If you leave your existing savings alone, keep funding your IRA or 401(k), and avoid high-interest debt, there's a good chance you'll manage to stick to your target retirement date despite the many obstacles that may now be in your way.

The announcement on Friday came one day after ousted vaccine chief Rick Bright said there are no plans to distribute a vaccine on an equitable scale, and called the timeline of 12 to 18 months being presented ""an aggressive schedule.""

""A lot of optimism is swirling around a 12-to-18-month time frame if everything goes perfectly. We've never seen everything go perfectly,"" Bright said Thursday before House lawmakers. ""I think it's going to take longer than that to do so.""

Trump departs the White House for Camp David

Before he boarded Marine One bound for Camp David late this afternoon, President Trump briefly spoke to reporters and was asked whether the COVID-19 vaccine should be available for free.

""We're looking at that, actually. But we're making a lot of progress on vaccines,"" Trump said. ""But we'll be speaking to you very soon, and I think we're going to have a very good couple of meetings at Camp David.""

He said he would have ""some military"" discussions and ""some other than military"" talks over the weekend.

When the president visited Camp David for another getaway weekend two weeks ago, it was the first time he had left the White House since March 28. Since then, he's also visited the battleground states of Arizona and Pennsylvania.

Trump says truckers blaring horns outside White House during event honoring people connected to COVID-19 'are on our side'

As they did earlier, truckers protesting near the White House blared their horns during a second event in the Rose Garden this afternoon meant to honor people connected to COVID-19.

""Those are friendly truckers, they are on our side,"" Trump told the audience. ""It is almost a celebration, in a way.""

The horns were very loud and could be heard at all times while Trump and the honorees spoke.

The truckers have protested in Washington for nearly two weeks over fair pay and low freight rates during the pandemic -- not in favor of, or against, the president.

The afternoon event's honorees included a nurse from West Virginia who volunteered in New York, a property owner from Arkansas who waived rent for his tenants and a Girl Scout troop from Maryland that donated cookies to first responders.

One of the scouts kept her mask on when she took the podium to speak. Three in the troop stepped forward to accept certificates from an unmasked President Trump.

The White House said the event, similar to one held two weeks ago, was meant to highlight the ""hard work, heroism and hope that Americans from all walks of life have exemplified during the COVID-19 pandemic.""

New White House coronavirus task force members announced

Vice President Mike Pence's office announced the addition of five people to the White House coronavirus task force on Friday, as the group shifts its messaging to focus on safely reopening the country, even though the country's infection rate has yet to significantly drop.

The new members include: Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue, Secretary of Labor Gene Scalia, Director of the National Institutes of Health Dr. Francis Collins, FDA Director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research Dr. Peter Marks and Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration Thomas Engels.

In a written statement, Pence said these new members ""will add expertise in the fields of vaccines and therapeutics as well as worker safety as the Task Force renews its focus on getting Americans back to work.""

The president and vice president are currently maintaining distance from each other after two White House staffers tested posted for coronavirus last week. Trump said Thursday of Pence: ""I miss him.""

President Donald Trump delivered remarks on vaccine development Friday afternoon, proclaiming that ""Operation Warp Speed,"" his administration's initiative to fast-track a vaccine, is the country's biggest undertaking since the Manhattan Project.

""Nobody has seen anything like we are doing now within our country since the Second World War. It's objective is to finish developing and then to manufacture and distribute a proven coronavirus vaccine as fast as possible. Again, we'd love to see if we can do it prior to the end of the year,"" Trump said, adding that the military is ""totally involved.""

Touting his message of reopening, the ever-optimistic president also said ""vaccine or no vaccine"" the country is already coming back.

""I just want to make something clear. It's very important. Vaccine or no vaccine, we're back, and we're starting the process. And in many cases, they don't have vaccines, and a virus or a flu comes, and you fight through it,"" Trump said.

""As of this morning, almost every state has taken steps to begin reopening, and the American people are doing an extraordinary job of continuing to take precautions while at the same time wanting to start, and they will be starting to resume their American way of life,"" he added.

Trump said in the afternoon remarks from the Rose Garden that the development of treatments, in addition to vaccines, will be fast-tracked and made available ""quickly,"" and ""maybe before"" the end of the year.

He also formally announced that former pharmaceutical executive Moncef Slaoui will lead the country's vaccine development with Army Gen. Gustave Perna, the commander of United States Army Materiel Command, working alongside him.

Trump said vaccines will be made ""right here in the U.S.A."" but that he will help other countries in every way possible.

""We have no ego when it comes to this, no ego whatsoever,"" the president said.

His call to also ""ramp up production of supplies needed for distribution, such as cold chain storage, glass vials, needles, syringes, and more,"" came one day after ousted vaccine chief Rick Bright told lawmakers the federal government has faced depletions of N95 masks, swabs and other essential equipment since January.

Since Bright said his concerns were ignored by officials including Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, Azar has stayed by the president's side, and even joined him Thursday to criticize his former employee.

""Our vision for Operation Warp Speed -- setting a goal of a vaccine by January 2021 -- will be one of the great scientific and humanitarian accomplishments in human history,"" Azar said Friday, standing next to the president.

""Dr. Slaoui is arguably the world's most experienced and successful vaccine developer, responsible for some of the major recent breakthroughs in vaccines. General Perna oversees one of the world's largest logistics and supply chain operations, the one that keeps the army running,"" he continued.

Trump was later asked to follow up on what he meant when he said the country is back, ""vaccine on no vaccine.""

""We think we're going to have a vaccine in the pretty near future, and if we do, we're gonna really be a big step ahead. And if we don't, we're gonna be like so many other cases where you had a problem come in, it'll go away at some point,"" Trump said. ""But if it does flare up, we're gonna put out the fire and will put it out quickly and efficiently.""

In an interview with Fox Business aired Thursday, President Trump said he plans to mobilize the U.S. military to distribute the vaccine when it becomes available, focusing first on older Americans who are among the most at risk.

""I just literally left a meeting. We're are mobilizing our military -- and other forces, but we are mobilizing our military on the basis that we do have a vaccine,"" he said. ""Our military is now being mobilized so at the end of the year, we're going to be able to give it to a lot of people very, very rapidly.""

FDA commissioner says it's up to White House if they'll still use Abbott ID NOW test after accuracy concerns

Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Steven Hahn said on ""CBS"" Friday morning ""that will be a White House decision"" as to whether they still use the Abbott ID NOW test in light of an FDA notice ""alerting the public to early data that suggest potential inaccurate results.""

""Specifically, the test may return false negative results,"" the agency said in a statement Thursday night.

When asked if he'd continue to recommend the White House use it, Hahn said he would provide guidance.

""We're providing guidance to the White house regarding this test,"" Hahn said from his self-quarantine, which he's undergoing after he came into contact with a person who tested positive. ""We have been on an ongoing basis. And we will continue to do that. That will be a White House decision.""

Food and Drug Administration commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn is seen in a frame grab from a video feed as he testifies remotely during a U.S. Senate Committee for Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions hearing on the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Washington, May 12, 2020. via Reuters

Hahn noted that the FDA continues ""to recommend its use or to have it available for use"" and that, in light of the notice his agency sent, ""it might be worth, if the test is negative, getting a second confirmatory test. That's what our guidance is about.""

He also said the FDA is continuing to investigate the issue but that others haven't reported the same problems.

""There are some data to suggest that there may be inaccuracies, false negatives, with the Abbott test,"" he said. ""However, there are many users who have contacted us and have not had this problem.""

1030,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-unemployment-women-us-economy/,2020-05-15,Why unemployment fueled by pandemic is hitting women harder than men,"The joblessness crisis brought on by the coronavirus pandemic has dealt an unprecedented blow to women in the workforce, hitting women of color particularly hard. Just over 15% of women in the U.S. lost their jobs in April, compared to 13% of men — the first time an economic spiral has affected women, who were making big job gains until the crisis, worse than men.

""I worked… my son went to school, and all that's changed since the virus,"" Missouri mom Meghan Hiles told CBS News' consumer investigative correspondent Anna Werner.

Hiles worked as a massage therapist until she was furloughed on March 14. She said the spa she works for reopens June 1, but she worries for her and her 11-year-old son's health, because they both have asthma.

Hiles is also concerned for her stepmother, who has COPD and is her primary child care provider.

""If something were to happen to my stepmom, as in, I go in and I work on somebody, come to pick him up, and come over there and give something to her — if she died, I would feel terrible,"" she said.

More than 36 million Americans lost their jobs since the pandemic began. Experts say women have born the brunt of job losses because the industries that were hardest hit are ""hugely dominated by women"": leisure and hospitality, retail, education and health services.

""Think about who teaches, you know, grade school kids? Who works at a daycare center? Health care, who typically works in a doctor's office?"" economist Diane Lim, with the Penn Wharton Budget Model, said.

National Women's Law Center President and CEO Fatima Goss Graves said the crisis ""basically wiped out the job gains that women, and particularly black women, had since the last recession.""

The center ran an analysis that found roughly one in six black women and one in five Latino women are now unemployed.

""We don't know what the other side of this is going to look like,"" Goss Graves said.

New Jersey resident Simone Bailey found herself temporarily laid off from one of her hotel restaurant jobs. Her other new, full-time job was completely eliminated.

""We got called into the office and they let us know that we are laid off. Not even furloughed, just laid off,"" Bailey said.

The mother of two said the job losses left her feeling ""very displaced,"" and she has spent her time sewing face masks instead.

Bailey said her state unemployment check is just under $300 per week, and the extra federal money she was receiving only came for three weeks.

""I still don't see how I'm supposed to live,"" she said. ""And everybody else that I've worked with, all the other women that I was working with, it's the same thing.""

He also attacked former vice president Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, and boasted about crowd sizes at President Trump’s political events.



“They think they’re taking away Donald Trump’s greatest tool, which is being able to go into an arena and fill it with 50,000 people every single time,” he said.

The Biden campaign pushed back against Trump’s comments, calling them “unbelievably reckless.”

“We’re in the middle of the biggest public health emergency in a century, with almost 90,000 Americans dead, 1.5 million infected, and 36 million workers newly jobless,” Biden communications director Kate Bedingfield said in a statement. “So for Eric Trump to claim that the coronavirus is a political hoax that will ‘magically’ disappear is absolutely stunning and unbelievably reckless.”



She also accused the Trump administration of being “desperate to do whatever they can to throw up a smokescreen to try to conceal his historic mismanagement of this crisis.”



Leading health officials have repeatedly warned that the coronavirus will not go away by fall and that a surge in cases toward the end of the year could be even harder to manage than the current outbreak.

Anthony S. Fauci, the government’s top infectious-disease expert, said late last month that the global spread of the disease made it “inevitable” that the coronavirus would return or linger beyond the fall. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told The Washington Post a second wave of covid-19 could be worse than the first because it would coincide with the flu season.



President Trump himself has acknowledged the pandemic will remain a public health problem for months. Earlier this month, he said that although he is convinced covid-19 will disappear on its own, it “doesn’t mean it’s going to be gone, frankly, by fall or after the fall.”",real

As concerts are postponed, sporting events are canceled, schools are closed and tourist hot spots are shut down, experts recommend that even those who show no sign of illness stay home during this time of global pandemic.

That's right: It's advised that you self-quarantine.

Although remaining inside is a good way to protect yourself and others from the coronavirus, and is an important measure to help ""flatten the curve"" of daily cases that put pressure on our health care system, it could lead to a lesser evil: boredom and stir craziness.

What's there to do while stuck indoors? We've compiled 100 suggestions to help make your time quarantined as interesting – and perhaps even as productive – as possible.

Sputnik spoke about Amazon's success with Laurence Kotlikoff, a professor of Economics at Boston University.

Sputnik: According to reports, Jeff Bezos is set to be the world's first trillionaire. In your view, what are the main reasons that Amazon has been able to maintain its position on the market amid the pandemic?

Laurence Kotlikoff: The worry that people have about in-store shopping is the main reason. So it's very good news for Amazon, but really terrible days for retail outlets.

They are blocked in Boston and in Moscow, you're gonna find everything shut down. It's a ghost town. And every city in the US, with some exceptions in states that have decided to ignore the danger or the risk, they may find that they made a big mistake.

There are some countries that are able to continue maintaining retail outlets as they did before. But for the most part, we've got France, Italy, US, UK shut down. So the only way it can get the products is... over the internet from Amazon because I couldn't go down and try it out in IKEA as the store's been closed.

I do think that there's a question here whether these companies like Amazon need to be nationalised, to tell you the truth because it's a public marketplace.

The marketplace needs to be organised by governments. Some shops are not operating in a lot of countries on Sunday or Saturday, the weekends, because it's a day of rest for the workers. You don't want to have some people go to some stores if they are closed on Saturday and others are open.

It doesn't make sense. You want to coordinate. So if I go to the butcher shop, I can also walk across the street, go to the shoe store on the same day at the same hour. Otherwise, you don't get the same level of economic activity. So I think Amazon needs to be nationalised. And also the concentration of wealth going to one person or a set of people is not healthy for any country.

Sputnik: But what is the key element of Amazon’s success in comparison to any other company in this field?

Laurence Kotlikoff: What is their big advantage? They got in first. What is the big advantage of Facebook? They got in there first. It was random.

What about, a lot of companies that have been successful. We're just like a step ahead of the competition. But it's like a market where only one player can play. It makes sense to have one place as people don't want to go online to 20 different websites to see if they can find out what they can buy.

Sputnik: What impact can Amazon's success have on other competing firms on the US market?

Laurence Kotlikoff: Well, they can do what it has been doing. Same with realy big stores like Walmart. You can put small retailers out of business. Such stores as Walmart, Costco and IKEA are big box stores that are exploiting their natural monopolies.

So if you have a lot of small stores in a nice little town in the countryside and then maybe a Walmart... all the small stores in this little town suffer dramatically, and then the town is basically boarded up.

We have to think about, what kind of a society we want to have? People just buying from one company on the internet, buying from a couple of huge stores and having no community life, no towns, everybody just living inside their apartments or homes?

Is that the vision of our national urban planning that we're striving for or are we trying to maintain our way of life? Think about Europe. If you are in France or England, there are a few box stores, but they're pretty remote compared to what we have in the US.

It's a public good for everybody. Everybody can go out to the countryside and enjoy it. But then they (box stores) arrived in the Cotswolds, in the U.K. or the countryside of France.

In the US, you have to drive from the East Coast about a third way across the country to have that experience. I mean, there are places you can go in remote parts of New York state. We have a sprawling suburban system here.

We have decided that anybody can put up any kind of house, any kind of business on any road in any part of the country.

Sputnik: In your view, what can be done by the government and local authorities to help other companies keep afloat during this crisis?

Laurence Kotlikoff: During this crisis, we need to explain something to you that is a little different from the standard answer you might be expecting, which is we need to find a way to capture or kill this virus. And there is a method for doing that, which is very straightforward. Suppose you had the ability to give everybody a test every single day so if they were negative, you could give them a rating bracelet to wear during the day, and they could go back to work, school, go to movies, shop. And if they were red, if they were testing positive, they'd have to stay inside until they tested green again and then they could go out.

That would immediately mean that everybody on the outside would be safe to interact with. Everybody on the inside would be trying to survive this thing, getting health care and free fruit right now. That's an example of containing and killing the virus. Within a few weeks, we would have no virus problem.

It would have been killed off. The people with the virus would have either survived or passed away, unfortunately. And the people outside would be virus-free. Now, there are issues of false negatives in the testing, but this protocol would work even under those conditions because you have it retesting people every day, so you'll catch the false negatives, any kinds of mistakes. Statistically, the transmission rate will go to zero very, very quickly. We do not have the ability to test everybody every day. That's 7.6 billion tests a day around the world. But we have something that's almost as effective, basic as effective, which is called group testing, where you take 60 households and you pull together, you have them spit into the same cup - that's a household sample.

And then you add a reagent to that and then you take each cup, each household sample from 60 different households and you mix all that together. And now you have one batch sample, one called a sample, one group sample and you test that.

And if it's negative now, you can give a green bracelet to probably another 50 people in that household.

You've used one test to clear one hundred and fifty people. That's an enormous deficiency. A hundred and fifty to one efficiency. So we could do a group household testing in our country with six million tests, which we can get to within a couple weeks.

We could solve this problem in a month if we use them with intelligence and organized, and make it voluntary. So this is really not that hard.

Clearly, there's other ways to try and fight this: social distancing and masking... but we're not compliant.",fake

Total production fell 11.2%, and manufacturing output declined a record 13.7% ""as all major industries posted decreases,"" the Federal Reserve said in a Friday release.

Factory activity was one of the first economic areas to be hit by the coronavirus pandemic, as global supply chain disruptions slowed production.

The pandemic ""causes the gears of industrial activity to grind to a halt,"" Gregory Daco, chief US economist at Oxford Economics, said in a note, adding he doesn't expect a full recovery until late 2021.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

US industrial production slid in April by the most since data collection began in 1919 as coronavirus lockdowns slammed manufacturing activity.

Manufacturing output plunged a record 13.7% ""as all major industries posted decreases,"" the Federal Reserve said in a Friday release. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expected a 14.6% drop.

Total production dipped 11.2% after its 4.5% contraction in March. Automobile and auto parts manufacturing plummeted more than 70%, the biggest industry-group decline in the Fed's index.

Capacity utilization, a metric that tracks the amount of a factory being used, declined 8.3 percentage points to 64.9 last month. The rate sits 14.9 percentage points below its average from 1972 to 2019, and slightly below its last all-time low seen during the financial crisis.

Even as the US pivots to economic reopening plans, factories are unlikely to see the smooth recovery hoped for in other sectors. Manufacturing activity declined relatively early in the pandemic's life, as supply chain disruptions slowed production before outbreaks cropped up in the US.

Weakened demand, lasting uncertainty, and fiscal tightening will delay a return to past levels of output by more than a year, Gregory Daco, chief US economist at Oxford Economics, said Friday.

""The coronavirus causes the gears of industrial activity to grind to a halt,"" he wrote in an emailed note. ""We forecast that industrial output losses will not be recovered until late-2021.""

One of the pioneers of Afro-funk music, the saxophonist Manu Dibango, has died of COVID-19. He was 86 years old, and died in Paris. Internationally, he was best known for his 1972 song ""Soul Makossa,"" though his entire oeuvre could have been the soundtrack to a cooler 1970s than most people lived. But that one, funk-drenched hit, lit by Dibango's burning saxophone, went on to influence the sound of American disco — and its hooky spoken intro helped power songs by Michael Jackson and Rihanna.

Dibango's death was announced on social media by his representatives, who said that he died Tuesday at age 86 due to the coronavirus; they had also announced last Wednesday that he had been hospitalized due to the pandemic. A public memorial will be ""organized when possible,"" the announcement said.

YouTube

""Soul Makossa"" became a hit in New York after DJ David Mancuso started playing the track at his Loft parties.

Dibango was born December 12, 1933, in the port city of Douala, Cameroon; his father was a civil servant. His parents' marriage was unusual for the time: His mother came from the Douala ethnic group, and his father from the Yabassi, and he later said that he never felt quite at home identifying with either.

When he was 15 years old, his parents sent him to study in France, so that he could return as an administrator, like his father. He paid for his initial rent in Europe with three kilograms of coffee from home — a fact that provided the title for his autobiography. He had been sent abroad to study philosophy, but instead fell in love with American jazz. As he told WHYY's Fresh Air in 1990, his parents were extremely upset by his decision to pursue music professionally, and cut him off.

While still in France, he began playing in bands — piano, mandolin, vibraphone and, soon enough, saxophone. Dibango made his way to Brussels, where he met one of Africa's greatest bandleaders, Joseph ""Grand Kallé"" Kabasele, a master of Congolese rumba. This was a time of exciting, super-danceable musical experimentation -- Congolese rumba was a blend of American jazz, Cuban rhythms and buoyant African sounds. The genre-bending, free-wheeling music became part of the roots of Dibango's own creativity as a bandleader.

Kabasele hired Dibango to play saxophone in his group, African Jazz. As part of that group, Dibango traveled to what was then Congo, now Zaire, to spend a month with the band. Instead, he stayed two years and opened his own club, Tam-Tam, in what was then the city of Léopoldville, now Kinshasa.

Dibango then moved to France where, in the late 1960s and early '70s, he began to forge a career as a significant solo artist. But ""Soul Makossa"" skyrocketed him to international fame.

In the years after the success of ""Soul Makossa,"" he collaborated with many famed international artists, including Art Blakey, Herbie Hancock, Don Cherry, Sly and Robbie, Paul Simon, Peter Gabriel, King Sunny Adé, Youssou N'Dour, Hugh Masekela and Fela Kuti.

""Soul Makossa"" was originally the B-side for a Dibango 45 RPM single; its refrain was something of a branding exercise for ""makossa,"" the funky, jazz-tinged dance genre that Dibango pioneered. (Kossa means ""dance"" in Douala, his mother's native language.)

In 1982, Michael Jackson picked up a version of a line that Dibango declaimed on ""Soul Makossa"" — which Jackson sang as ""mama-se, mama-sa, ma-makossa"" — on his song ""Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' "" from the album Thriller.

The Cameroonian musician sued the American megastar; Jackson settled out of court for an undisclosed amount of money. In 2007, Rihanna sampled Jackson's version of the ""Soul Makossa"" line on her song ""Don't Stop the Music."" (Jackson had given her permission, but not Dibango.) Two years later, Dibango sued Jackson again, as well as Rihanna in France; that time, his case failed, due to the earlier settlement.

Publicly, Dibango did not dwell on his wranglings with Jackson; as he wryly told Fresh Air in 1990, ""I think he wanted to say hello to Africa somewhere.""",real

Everything’s fine if it fits the narrative, Bloomberg Opinion editors might have thought when they misquoted World Bank statistics on the number of hospital beds per 1,000 residents, including the misrepresented data in a Russia-bashing op-ed by Clara Ferreira Marques, titled ‘How Putin’s Russia Bungled the Pandemic’.

Taking a swipe at Russia’s efforts to upgrade the Soviet healthcare system to make it less cumbersome and more effective, the piece argued that the endeavor failed, only leading to a drop in hospitals, beds available, and doctors.

To back up the premise, the article featured a graph claiming to be based on 2013 data from the World Bank. However, according to the World Bank’s actual stats, while Russia had over twice as many beds in 2013 (8.2 versus 3.8 per 1,000), the initial version of the Bloomberg story had Russia lagging far behind the OECD countries by the same margin.

The blunder did not go unnoticed by the Russian Embassy in the US, which accused Bloomberg of promoting a new barrage of “politicized allegations” with “fake” stats.

“We demand that Bloomberg Opinion refute, apologize and respect its own customers,” the embassy said in a Facebook statement.

We are convinced that readers and viewers of the leading American media deserve verified, but not deliberately distorted, information.

Several hours after the embassy voiced its protest, Bloomberg Opinion amended the article, embedding a correct version of the graph instead of the misleading one.

The blunder came just days after Bloomberg ran another story about Covid-19 and Russia that raised some eyebrows. “Experts Want to Know Why Coronavirus Hasn’t Killed More Russians,” the initial headline stated, in what many commenters saw as the outlet’s disappointment in the country’s relatively low death toll. It has since been changed twice to sound more neutral.

Other Western media outlets seem to be taking the same misleading doom-and-gloom approach in covering Russia’s fight with the epidemic. Last week, CNN declared Moscow “devastated” based on the number of identified cases, which came with increasingly large-scale testing.

Meanwhile, the New York Times and Financial Times seem to imply that the Russian government is covering up the damage done by the epidemic with the creative use of official mortality statistics. The mystery of Russia’s low death toll was thus “solved” by the Western press. But when the Russian Embassy in the US tried to have the New York Times print comparative statistics for Moscow, New York City, and London to give readers some proper context, it refused, according to the diplomats.

A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump’s measures of success. But after a manic 3½ years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.

By far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. “I’m not going to play that game,” said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. “I think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they’re not uniform across states and across countries.”

But even beyond the death count, there’s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. “I’m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,” the official said.

Some Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn’t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn’t been able to focus on getting the response right.

Trump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. “So it is a war and I define victory when it’s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,” he said on May 1. “It can never be a total victory because too many people have died.”

When American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn’t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush’s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.

Others are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. “Allowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,” argued one Republican close to the president.

“The closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.” Sen. Lindsey Graham

But, he added, “If things don’t look like they’re bouncing back by September, I think that’s going to be a problem.”

The fear that Trump can’t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.

When asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump’s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the “economic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.”

A spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.

Others are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)",real
83,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/world/live-coronavirus-news-updates.html,2020-03-16,"Gatherings Should Be Limited to 10 People, Trump Says","
This briefing has ended. Read our global live coverage here.
Trump released national guidelines to control the virus.The Trump administration released new guidelines on Monday to slow the spread of the coronavirus, including closing schools and avoiding groups of more than 10 people, discretionary travel, bars, restaurants and food courts.
Mr. Trump, flanked by task force members including Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the guidelines would apply for 15 days.
“It seems to me if we do a really good job, we’ll not only hold the death down to a level that’s much lower than the other way had we not done a good job, but people are talking about July, August,” Mr. Trump said about the duration of the crisis.
The new measures reflected the increasing gravity of global attempts to contain the virus as governments around the world, from Canada to Hungary, moved to close their borders to foreign travelers. They left unanswered the question of precisely what individuals and local governments should do, or how business owners and workers might survive financially, at a time when vast sections of the economy were ceasing to function.
“If everyone makes this change or these critical changes and sacrifices now,” Mr. Trump said, “we will rally together as one nation and we will defeat the virus and we’re going to have a big celebration all together.”
Hours earlier, Mr. Trump told a group of governors they should not wait for the federal government to fill the growing demand for respirators needed to help people diagnosed with coronavirus.
“Respirators, ventilators, all of the equipment — try getting it yourselves,” Mr. Trump told the governors during the conference call, a recording of which was shared with The New York Times.
The suggestion surprised some of the governors, who have been scrambling to contain the outbreak and looking to the federal government for help with equipment, personnel and financial aid.
At the briefing with the president, Dr. Fauci said the first phase of testing of a possible vaccine had begun on Monday. He stressed that some of the White House guidelines were inconvenient, but that they would help stop the spread of the virus and were not an overreaction.
“When you’re dealing with an emerging infectious diseases outbreak,” he said, “you are always behind where you think you are.”
Measures to slow the virus are slowing the economy, too.
It was clear on Monday that most of the American economy was grinding to a halt, and would remain that way for months, because of the coronavirus outbreak and the sweeping steps being taken to try to halt it.
On Wall Street, brokers and analysts were acting as if an economic collapse were inevitable, despite the Federal Reserve’s emergency moves on Sunday night to stoke economic growth through an aggressive bond-buying program. The S&P 500 fell nearly 12 percent on Monday and global oil prices slid below $30 a barrel, a four-year low.
“We’re calling the recession,” said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. “We have the three elements to make that call — a profound, pervasive and persistent contraction in economic activity.”
Business groups, local and state leaders and a growing chorus of lawmakers and economists begged the federal government to spend trillions of dollars to pay workers to stay home and funnel money to companies struggling with an abrupt end to consumer activity.
The administration floated several ideas for helping industry without conveying a clear plan. After the main trade group for airlines suggested a $50 billion bailout, Mr. Trump’s chief economist, Larry Kudlow, said, “We don’t see the airlines failing, but if they get into a cash crunch we’re going to try to help them.”
Employers and employees are torn between fears of being exposed to the virus and fears of running out of money to pay for food and electricity. And government officials are left with the unhappy task of shutting down businesses that provide wages for large swaths of their communities, while wondering what steps their neighbors are taking.
On Monday, Senator Mitt Romney of Utah called for the government to cut a $1,000 check, immediately, to every American.
“People don’t have reserves, they live hand-to mouth,” said Joseph Stiglitz, a Nobel-winning economist. “People won’t be able to pay their rents, landlords won’t be able to pay their oil bills, the whole system could break down.”
The consequences of China’s harsh measures to halt the virus — restricting the movement of about 700 million people at one point — became apparent on Monday when the government released economic data showing industrial output falling to its lowest level in decades and unemployment rising at its highest rate ever in February.
The Kentucky Derby is postponed until September.For the first time since World War II, the Kentucky Derby will not take place on the first Saturday in May.
The Derby, the first jewel of horse racing’s Triple Crown, became the latest marquee sporting event forced to postpone because of the deepening coronavirus pandemic.
Churchill Downs will hold a conference call on Tuesday morning to announce a makeup date for the race, which is expected to be Sept. 5. The Courier-Journal newspaper in Louisville, Ky., where the race is held, had earlier reported the postponement.
The race, which touts itself as the “most exciting two minutes in sports,” regularly draws more than 150,000 spectators to the famed racetrack with its twin spires.
The coronavirus has transformed the sporting landscape. The N.B.A., the N.H.L. and Major League Baseball have all suspended play, and the N.C.A.A. canceled all of its championships.
Racetracks across the country have been shuttered to the public, but races are still being run and bets are still being welcomed. According to The Courier-Journal, the Derby and the weeks of celebration that surround it infuse the region with about $400 million yearly.
In 1945, the Kentucky Derby was held on June 9, about a month after the government lifted a ban on horse racing that it put in place because of World War II. The only other year the race did not take place on the first Saturday in May was in 1901.
Latin America begins grappling with the virus.
Stringent measures were imposed over the weekend in several Latin American nations, where the outbreak has generally arrived later than in Europe or North America.
In Venezuela, President Nicolás Maduro — an authoritarian leader whose government is considered illegitimate by the United States and about 60 other nations — seized on the upheaval caused by the pandemic to present himself as a responsible guardian of public health.
On Monday night, in an announcement made on state TV, Mr. Maduro said a nationwide quarantine would take effect Tuesday at 5 a.m. local time. The country is now at 33 cases, according to Mr. Maduro, who called the move “a drastic and necessary measure.”
Earlier in the day, he responded to 17 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the country by ordering a lockdown of the capital, Caracas, and six other states on Monday. “We either go into quarantine, or the pandemic could brutally and tragically bring down our country,” he said in a terse televised speech on Sunday that was a departure from his typically rambling addresses. He called on the United States to loosen sanctions against his government.
Other Latin American countries have also responded to dozens of confirmed cases. Ecuador and Peru announced countrywide lockdowns. President Iván Duque of Colombia shut the borders to nonresidents. In Costa Rica, the government decreed a state of emergency that included closing its borders.
In contrast, President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil encouraged mass demonstrations by his supporters against his opponents in Congress on Sunday. Though Mr. Bolsonaro has been close to people who tested positive for the virus, he shook hands and posed for photos with supporters.
Scientists say there are likely 5 to 10 undetected cases for every confirmed one.
Scientists tracking the spread of the coronavirus reported Monday that, for every confirmed case, there are most likely another five to 10 people in the community with undetected infections. On average these people are about half as infectious as confirmed ones, but they are responsible for transmitting the virus in nearly 80 percent of new cases, according to the report, which was based on data from China.
The researchers modeled the virus’s natural spread in China before the government instituted a travel ban and an aggressive testing policy. During that time, from December 2019 through late January, about 85 percent of cases went undetected. That situation is analogous to the current state of affairs in the United States and other Western countries, where tests are not widely available, the researchers said.
“If we have 3,500 confirmed cases in the U.S., you might be looking at 35,000 in reality,” said Jeffrey Shaman, an epidemiologist at Columbia University and the senior author of the new report, which was posted by the journal Science.
The report is among the first to address two pressing questions: How many people are walking around with unrecognized infections, and how infectious are they? American policymakers have begun taking more aggressive measures to slow transmission, like canceling events and closing restaurants, but access to tests has been difficult or nonexistent in much of the country.
The E.U. plans to seal itself off from almost all international travel.
The top official of the European Union said on Monday that she was proposing a shutdown of all nonessential travel into the bloc. President Emmanuel Macron of France said national leaders would approve the plan on Tuesday.
“We propose to introduce a temporary restriction to non-essential travel to the European Union,” said Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, after a teleconference with G7 leaders. “Of course there will be exemptions for E.U. citizens coming back home, health care workers, doctors and nurses.”
The restriction would last for 30 days, and would not interfere with travel from one European Union country to another. But some of the member states have already taken steps in that direction.
Ten of the 26 countries that make up the passport-free Schengen Area have reintroduced border controls, partly or fully suspending the rules of the flagship European Union program, a spokesman for the European Commission said.
The Trump administration turns on itself.
Infighting, turf wars and a president more concerned with the stock market and media coverage than policy have defined the Trump White House. They have also defined how it has handled a pandemic.
The White House culture that President Trump has fostered and abided by for more than three years has shaped his administration’s response to a deadly pandemic that is upending his presidency and the rest of the country, with dramatic changes to how Americans live their daily lives.
It all explains how Mr. Trump could announce he was dismissing his acting chief of staff as the crisis grew more severe, creating even less clarity in an already fractured chain of command. And it was a major factor in the president’s reluctance to even acknowledge a looming crisis, for fear of rattling the financial markets that serve as his political weather vane.
Mr. Trump has refused repeated warnings to rely on experts, or to neutralize some of the power held by his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, in favor of a traditional staff structure. He has rarely fully empowered people in the jobs they hold.
“Part of this is President Trump being Donald J. Trump, the same guy he’s always been, and part of it is a government he has now molded in his image, rather than having a government as it has traditionally been, to serve the chief executive, and to serve the job of governing the country,” said David Lapan, a former spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security and the Pentagon, and a former aide of Mr. Kelly.
Health officials order millions in the Bay Area to “shelter in place.”
Six counties in Northern California have ordered all residents to “shelter in place” in an effort to stop the coronavirus from surging.
The order, which takes effect Tuesday, is expected to disrupt life for millions of residents in Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, San Francisco, San Mateo, and Santa Clara counties. The city of Berkeley also issued the same order.
That means staying at home except for the most essential reasons. Officials said people would be allowed to leave the house for essential work, to go to a grocery store, pick up medication, or even walk the dog. But they urged everyone to practice social distancing while outside. “It is now time to do your part,” Dr. Scott Morrow, the San Mateo health officer, said in a statement.
“It’s asking people to go home with their families and to stay there until they are told otherwise,” said Mayor Joe Goethals of San Mateo, adding that only “essential” businesses like hospitals, grocery stores and pharmacies would remain open.
“I don’t expect anyone to get arrested,” said Mr. Goethals, who said people will still be allowed to go outside for limited activities, like buying food and getting fresh air. “But it’s not optional. This is mandatory for all of us.”
The number of coronavirus cases in the United States crossed the 4,000 mark on Monday, with more than 70 deaths, including the first deaths in Indiana, Nevada and South Carolina.
A growing number of cities and states have taken significant actions to slow the coronavirus, shutting down schools, restaurants, bars, movie theaters and gyms. The restrictions stretched from the now-empty sidewalks of New York City, where officials had made the wrenching decision to shut down public schools, to the fields and urban centers of Ohio. Millions of Americans are now hunkered down at home for the foreseeable future.
France imposes a nationwide lockdown.
Declaring “we are at war,” President Emmanuel Macron of France prohibited public gatherings of any size, postponed municipal elections and told people to stay in their homes except for essential needs.
His order, which goes into effect on Tuesday, is one of the most stringent anywhere in Europe. Officials said that going out for a walk to get some fresh air would be allowed, but meeting a friend on a street or in a park would be punishable with a fine.
Christophe Castaner, the interior minister, said anyone on a public outing would need to carry a document justifying it, even if only a sworn statement written by that person. He said that 100,000 law enforcement officers would be deployed to enforce the order.
Olivier Véran, France’s health minister, said that the government was asking each French person to limit human contact to a maximum of five people a day. France, with more than 6,600 coronavirus cases and 148 deaths by Monday, had already ordered all “non-indispensable” businesses closed.
“We will be able to end the confinement,” Mr. Véran said in a post on Twitter. “But without confinement, we will not be able to end the epidemic.”
Spain, with almost 10,000 cases and more than 300 deaths by Monday, also ordered residents to mostly stay at home, though it is still allowing most people to go to work and has not announced any punitive measures. Schools, restaurants and bars were ordered to close.
The pace of new coronavirus infections reported in Europe accelerates daily — roughly 6,000 on Thursday, 7,000 on Friday, 8,000 on Saturday, 9,000 on Sunday and 10,000 on Monday, bringing the total to about 62,000. France and Spain warned that their health care systems could be overwhelmed.
And in Italy, still the hardest-hit country in Europe and the first to impose nationwide restrictions on movement, the government announced $28 billion in emergency aid to individuals, businesses and the health care system to stave off chaos and financial ruin.
Italy had almost 28,000 infections and more than 1,800 deaths as of Monday.The government’s aid package delays mortgage, loan and tax payments, and offers extended parental leave, sick leave for people in quarantine, babysitting vouchers, and grants for self-employed and seasonal workers.
“We never considered fighting a flood with buckets,” Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said. “We are trying to build a dam to protect businesses, families and workers.”
Ohio governor ignores court ruling and postpones Tuesday’s primary.
Ohio’s governor on Monday night said he and top state heath officials would ignore a court ruling and postpone Ohio’s presidential primary by declaring a public health emergency because of the coronavirus outbreak.
The governor, Mike DeWine, said that the state’s health director, Dr. Amy Acton, had issued the order based on concerns that the coronavirus outbreak placed both voters and poll workers in potential danger.
His announcement came just hours after Judge Richard A. Frye of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas rejected the state’s request to push back voting to June 2.
Ohio was one of four states scheduled to vote on Tuesday. The other three — Arizona, Illinois and Florida — said that they planned to proceed with their elections while taking additional health precautions.
Kentucky also announced that it was delaying its primary.
U.S. airlines ask for $50 billion in emergency support from the government.
The lobbying group for America’s biggest airlines called on the government on Monday to provide more than $50 billion in grants, loan guarantees and tax relief. The group, Airlines for America, warned that the current situation was not sustainable for the industry and that there was no end in sight to the crisis.
“This is a today problem, not a tomorrow problem,” said Nicholas E. Calio, chief executive of Airlines for America. “It requires urgent action.”
The industry group said that flight cancellations are outpacing new bookings and that the decline in demand is getting worse by the day. The request included $25 billion in grants for passenger carriers, $4 billion in grants for cargo, $25 billion in loan guarantees.
On Sunday, United Airlines executives said they were in talks with union leaders about reducing payroll costs. The moves being considered include furloughs, pay cuts and reducing minimum hours.
United’s corporate officers will be taking a 50 percent pay cut, Oscar Munoz, the chief executive, and Scott Kirby, the president, said in a letter. Both have already said they would forgo their base salaries through June.
Reversing course, Britain says to avoid travel and contact with people.
In a sharp reversal, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Monday that everyone should avoid unnecessary travel and contact with others, should work at home and should stop going to places like bars, restaurants and theaters.
Mr. Johnson called the measures “very draconian,” but he stopped well short of the kinds of steps taken by some harder-hit European countries. He did not order schools or businesses closed, did not tell people to stay in their homes, and said the steps were not mandatory, but rather “giving very strong advice.”
Mr. Johnson and his government had faced harsh criticism for its laissez-faire approach to the pandemic. They had spoken hopefully of “herd immunity” — in which many people would be infected, recover and then, it is hoped, be immune — while it was inevitable that many people would take ill and die.
But at a news conference on Monday with top medical officials, he said: “Now is the time for everyone to stop nonessential contact with others and to stop all unnecessary travel.”
In particular, people over 70 and those with serious illnesses should avoid contact with others, Mr. Johnson said, suggesting that as a result, people should not visit nursing and retirement homes.
The English actor Idris Elba, who was in the HBO series “The Wire,” announced on Monday that he had tested positive for the coronavirus, sharing the news with fans in a video that he posted on Twitter.
“Transparency is probably the best thing for this right now,” said Mr. Elba, 47. “If you’re feeling ill or you feel like you should be tested or you’ve been exposed, then do something about it. It’s really important.”

Socialism, Sharia law and Islam are creeping in while we are all distracted with authoritarian Coronavirus lockdown orders.

The Muslim community has been flexing its muscle since government officials have ordered unconstitutional lockdown orders across the country.

Culver City is the latest Southern California city to allow the Islamic call to prayer, or “adhan,” to blare five times a day from a loudspeaker (beginning at 4:30 AM) during the Coronavirus shutdown.

Many residents in Culver City however say the Islamic call to prayer is too loud and made formal complaints to the police department.

Mahmood Navi stood on the roof of King Fahad Mosque and used a microphone to belt out the Islamic all to prayer.

The mosque has a giant blue and white minaret that towers over the street in Culver City.

The police department revoked the amplified noise permit after numerous complaints from residents.

However, three days later, the city reinstated the permit if the mosque agreed to lower the volume.

Los Angeles Time reported:

Outside the Culver City mosque, some pedestrians stopped in their tracks when they first heard the adhan, seemingly surprised. This was something new, and it was not altogether clear how it would be received — as with many things Muslim in the U.S. But in Culver City, the call to prayer did not go unchallenged for long. After four days, on May 18, the city’s police department revoked the amplified noise permit, citing people congregating at the mosque in violation of the county health order, as well as “numerous loud noise complaints from area residents.” “We have had and will continue to have a great relationship with mosque leadership,” said Capt. Jason Sims with the Culver City Police Department. “We are certainly happy to help with facilitating any type of service that is not in violation of county health orders.” Three days later, the city changed course again, reinstating the permit on the condition that the mosque lower the volume.

When will it be safe for children to return to the classroom?

That is the question being debated from the Oval Office to the dining room table, and the implications of doing so successfully will mark a significant turning point as societies look to emerge from the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

Over the weekend, a senior public health official declared that emerging case studies of various open schools abroad suggest children seem “less capable of spreading” the virus -- a welcome sign for parents eager to regain some sense of normalcy.

“What we have seen in countries where schools have remained open is that there have not been big outbreaks in schools,” Soumya Swaminathan, the World Health Organization’s chief scientist, told the BBC on Sunday. “And where there have been it has been associated with events where a lot of people gather, not in regular classrooms. And it has often been associated with an adult who has had the infection and who spread it.""

But experts caution that while the emerging data is reassuring, it is simply too early to make any conclusive statements on whether or not children are less able to spread the virus relative to adults. The schools referenced by Swaminathan have all instituted social distancing and enhanced hygiene protocols that make virus spreading less likely.

A dearth of information about how the disease manifests in children makes reopening schools a potentially risky endeavor. Children may be just as likely to bring home the virus and should be taught to follow the same preventive measures to prevent the spread to others -- a particularly challenging feat since younger children are typically not as conscious of proper hygiene habits.

“It’s hard to make a definitive answer at this moment about children’s’ role in the transmission dynamic,” said Dr. John Brownstein, an epidemiologist at Boston Children’s Hospital and an ABC News contributor.

Experts agree that the virus affects children differently than it does adults. When children contract the virus, for example, they often show mild symptoms or no symptoms at all.

“The data suggests right now that children don’t get as sick as adults do,” Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, a professor of pediatrics and infectious disease at Stanford University, told ABC News. “We aren’t seeing a lot of hospitalizations [with children], and the ones we are seeing seem to be distinct from what the adults are experiencing.”

In response to an inquiry about Swaminathan’s comments, the Center for Disease Control issued a brief statement to ABC News.

""Children can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 the same way as adults, and they can infect others if they have it,” the statement reads. “Like adults, children may be infected but not have symptoms, and there is increasing evidence that people without symptoms may also spread the disease.""

So where does that leave us on the question of transmissibility?

While children may be at lower risk of feeling symptoms of the disease, they still play a key role in mitigating its spread. As Brownstein said, “every kid is a bridge to a vulnerable person,” and traditionally, with respiratory viruses, children’s behavior lends itself to disease proliferation.

“Generally, children are important vectors in respiratory virus epidemics because of congregation, hygiene,” Brownstein said. “They’re in schools.”",real

Wuhan. Bergamo. Seattle. New Rochelle.By the time cast, crew and fans assembled on March 9 for the first preview of a new musical version of “Mrs. Doubtfire,” the coronavirus was at the stage door.
All over Broadway, theater operators were installing hand sanitizer dispensers and scrubbing armrests. Ticket holders were beginning to bail.
“Hadestown” barred stage-door greetings. An usher who worked at “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” and “Six” tested positive for Covid-19. And “Moulin Rouge!” canceled a day’s performances because a company member was feverish.
“Mrs. Doubtfire” got through three performances before Broadway shut down.“Our house manager texted us and told us to hold on, and then she said, ‘Don’t come, don’t come, don’t come’,” recalled Lisa Berger, a “Doubtfire” usher. “It wasn’t a total surprise, to be honest. I just didn’t think it was going to happen that quickly.”
Now two months have gone by, and almost everyone associated with the production — about 150 people — is out of work: actors and musicians, obviously, but also bartenders and box office workers, carpenters and choreographers, designers and dressers, programmers and propmasters. A few vendors — the publicists, for example — were furloughed and then rehired under the federal Paycheck Protection Program — but even they expect to be unemployed when that money runs out after eight weeks.
“People think of Broadway as very glamorous, but I don’t think they understand how many families and lives depend on it,” said David Korins, the show’s set designer. He was forced to lay off most of his employees after all 24 productions his company was working on, including “Hamilton,” “Dear Evan Hansen” and “Beetlejuice,” abruptly stopped.
“Everything went away,” he said. “It was a cascade. And, by the way, I fully endorse it. But, literally, our income went to zero.”
Broadway, of course, is a summit for theatermakers, a symbol of New York and a big business that, until now, had been enjoying an extended boom. Last year was the best attended on record, with 14.6 million patrons; Broadway shows collectively grossed $1.8 billion.
The shutdown brought an abrupt end to that prolonged party. And among the 39 plays and musicals halted were 16 that never even made it to opening night, “Doubtfire” included.
“Doubtfire” was a big bet, aimed squarely at the sweet spot of the Broadway audience: a $17 million musical, adapted from a hit movie, that aspired to be funny, poignant and family-friendly.
Now the “Doubtfire” family has scattered across the country — some as close as Times Square, some as far as London — trying to stay safe and sane. They, like the rest of their theater world colleagues, have no idea when New York will settle in to some new normal, no idea when Broadway will attempt a comeback. They are worried, but also hopeful — a microcosm of an industry that is distressed but determined.
‘We’re doing the right thing.’“Mrs. Doubtfire” is a story about family. One family, really: The Hillards — Daniel, Miranda and their three children. The parents split up, and the father (memorably portrayed in the 1993 film by Robin Williams) is so determined to spend time with his children that he pretends to be a woman to land a job as the housekeeper.
Hilarity ensues. Trouble looms. Lessons are learned.After a five-week pre-Broadway run at Seattle’s 5th Avenue Theater, the stage adaptation headed for Broadway facing headwinds — reviews in Seattle were mixed, shifting gender politics had made men in dresses an unreliable laugh line, and a stage adaptation of “Tootsie” had just flopped. Plus, every Broadway show is enormously risky, because most of them fail.
But the producers, led by the Broadway veteran Kevin McCollum (“Rent,” “Avenue Q”), were feeling confident as they sped toward an April 5 opening night. The audiences in Seattle seemed to like the show. And the lead actor, Rob McClure, who scored a Tony nomination for playing the title role in “Chaplin,” starred in “Honeymoon in Vegas,” and was featured most recently in “Beetlejuice,” was nailing his bifurcated performance.
Then, McClure said, “The universe hit pause.”On that final day, the cast had gathered for an afternoon rehearsal knowing that, at any time, Broadway might shut down. “I’ll never forget checking my phone during our Wednesday evening performance and seeing that the N.B.A. had suspended the season, and knowing what was coming,” said Brad Oscar, a two-time Tony nominee for “Something Rotten!” and “The Producers.”
Jenn Gambatese, the actress starring as Miranda (a role played on film by Sally Field), was center stage, rehearsing new blocking for her big solo number, when a stage manager told the company to brace for a closing announcement. She kept going for another 90 minutes.
“I felt calmer than I had in a while, and felt like I could focus better,” said Gambatese, who had been so unnerved by the drumbeat of virus news that she brought a suitcase to work in case her commuter rail line was shut down and she got stuck in Midtown. “Every day was getting scarier and scarier,” she said.
Midafternoon, McCollum and the show’s director, Jerry Zaks, assembled the company and told everyone to grab their stuff and go home.
And just like that, it was over. The costumes were stored in dressing rooms. The souvenir tote bags and tumblers were locked in a cabinet. The ghost light — a bare bulb placed onstage when a theater is empty — was illuminated.
Many expected they’d be back in four weeks — the initial projected length of the shutdown. “I remember placing my pencil down on my script and thinking to myself, ‘It’s so weird — that pencil is going to be in exactly the same place when we come back in a month,’” said Philip S. Rosenberg, the lighting designer.
McClure went home to Philadelphia. Tara Llewellyn, a dresser, joined her grandmother in Connecticut. KJ Hippensteel, a member of the ensemble, fled to his father-in-law’s house in Cleveland with his wife and their two sons.
“Both of us lost our jobs, for now, and we had no reason to stay,” he said. “Really, we panicked and had to take action to feel like we were in control. In hindsight I think we were super lucky to have gotten out when we did.”
Among those who stayed: Peter Bartlett, a comedic character actor and the oldest member of the cast, who plays a television host named Mr. Jolly. “At 77, this is the true passages of terror,” he said.
Most of the time, Bartlett has been holed up in his one-bedroom apartment in Hell’s Kitchen, sustained by savings, Social Security and union pensions, talking to friends, reading, cleaning his kitchen and washing his hands. “Did I ever think I’d watch a dog rescue on YouTube? Now I’ve watched hundreds of them,” he said. “Anything to distract myself.”
Others are finding their own distractions, like making ice cream, or practicing yoga. “Destruction leaves a lot of creative space to occupy,” said Akilah Ayanna, an ensemble member who is working on an album.
So Alexandra Matteo, a company member who understudies several parts, is podcasting. Tommy Kurzman, the makeup and prosthetics designer, adopted a dog. Paul Woodiel, the concertmaster, is singing cowboy songs with his wife (they are both violinists).
“We have nice harmonies going on ‘Keep on the Sunny Side,’” he said, “if only I could get through the lyrics without choking up.”
‘It has upended our lives.’Broadway is a coveted corner of the theater world for many reasons — prestige, large audiences, enormous talent. But it’s important for a much more materialistic reason: in a low-paying, high unemployment field, it’s a place where theater artists can earn a good salary. The base pay for actors on Broadway is about $2,200 a week.
But the shutdown has thrown thousands out of work. Most union members got a few weeks’ pay after the closing, but that has long since ended. And the usual fallbacks when stage shows are scarce — television, film, even waiting tables — are unavailable during this phase of the pandemic.
“Pretty much everyone I know is planning on not paying their rent, because how are we expected to do that?” said Cameron Rasmussen, one of the show’s three guitarists.
Several members of the company are married to others in the industry, meaning they are now facing a double income loss. Michael Rico Cohen, a stage manager, is married to a freelance television producer. “It’s going to be quite a few months before either of us sees a real paycheck again,” he said. And Colleen Dietz, the show’s music copyist (preparing the score for individual musicians), is married to Zachary Dietz, the music director. “I know we will come back from this, but it will be a long, hard road for New York and for our family,” she said.
Among the more complex predicaments is that facing the family of 9-year-old Lily Tamburo, who was cast as the understudy for Natalie, one of the three Hillard children. Lily lives in the Setaukets, on Long Island, with her mother and three older siblings; when the late-night commute proved too exhausting at her age, her mother, Lauren Zummo, rented an apartment in the city for the two of them. But when the pandemic hit, Zummo was forced to shut down the Pilates and yoga studio she runs on Long Island, and, of course, Lily lost her income. Zummo was able to walk away from the Manhattan sublet, but not the studio, where her landlord is insisting on being paid.
“The virus has bankrupted us, obviously,” Zummo said.This pandemic is primarily a public health crisis, and Broadway has been hit hard by the disease — multiple members of the “Moulin Rouge!” cast fell ill, as did a number of theater artists, producers and publicists. The “Doubtfire” family has been relatively fortunate on that front, but not unscathed.
Korins, the set designer, lost his uncle to Covid-19. He was 80, and had just moved in January from Florida to Yonkers, N.Y., where he fell ill at an assisted-living facility and died at a hospital. “He died alone, not having spoken to anyone for several days,” Korins said. “It’s one of those unbelievably tragic moments.”
Others have found themselves caring for those infected. Calvin L. Cooper, an actor in the ensemble, saw one friend test positive for Covid-19, and then another fall ill.
“For nine long, scary days I helped nurse my friend back to stable levels,” he said. “He is called presumably positive. I am presumably asymptomatic.”
And both members of the show’s choreography team — Lorin Latarro, the choreographer, and MJ Slinger, her associate, are partnered with doctors who worked with Covid patients. Latarro is married to a neurosurgeon who was redeployed to Covid care; she and their 2-year-old daughter moved out for several weeks to avoid infection. “I know some families have it worse,” she said. “We are back home together now.”
‘I can’t control if my voice changes.’Maria Dalanno was one of the last people to join the “Doubtfire” cast. She was 18 and still in high school in Ohio when she submitted an audition video shot by her mother; five days later, she booked a part as the understudy for Lydia, the older Hillard daughter.
She left high school, deferred college and moved to New York. Now she’s back home, playing with her dog and painting.
“I made my debut in previews, and then moved right back home in the midst of a pandemic,” she said. “I am now worrying about following social distancing guidelines, being able to pay for my apartment, and when I will see my new friends and castmates again.”
For the six performers playing children in the “Doubtfire” cast — each character has an understudy — the shutdown has been particularly tough to understand.
“Getting a break on Broadway, especially for a child, is nothing short of a miracle,” said Shanna Sell, whose 9-year-old daughter, Avery Sell, was making her Broadway debut as Natalie, the younger Hillard daughter. The Sells live in Florida, and Avery is now back in New Port Richey. “Having the rug pulled out from underneath her little feet, just weeks before her debut, has been nothing short of heartbreaking,” Shanna Sell said.
Jake Ryan Flynn, the 13-year-old Massachusetts boy who plays the Hillards’ son, Christopher, has his own concern — that if the Broadway shutdown drags on, he will age out of the role. This is his second Broadway show — he was one of three boys alternating in the title role of “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,” and he knows that contracts allow producers to replace children as they grow too tall.
“My parents keep telling me to only worry about what I can control,” he said. “But right now it feels like I’m in control of nothing in my life. I can’t control if I grow. I can’t control if my voice changes. I can’t control when I will see my cast mates again. I can’t control if the creatives and producers take a look at me in a few months and fire me because I’m too big. It just makes me sad.”
‘It felt like a miracle that we were all able to connect.’The invitations came from Mark Evans, a Welsh actor playing Stuart Dunmire, the new love interest for Miranda Hillard.
Put on something fun. Grab a snack or a drink. Turn on your computer.On April 5, the night that “Doubtfire” was scheduled to open on Broadway, the company instead gathered online and performed the show — beginning to end — just for one another.
They called it their Fauxpening. Eighty-two people participated. Kaleigh Cronin, an ensemble member sheltering with her husband and dog at her parents’ house in New Hampshire, wore the dress from her 8th grade dance, which she found in her childhood closet.
There were speeches and stories, songs and slip-ups — Evans was so busy organizing that when the second act rolled around he forgot his lines. Onscreen, the actors sang their songs. In the chat section, some of the stage managers typed out cues.
“Zoom was still a novelty, as opposed to the norm,” Evans said. “It felt like a miracle that we were all able to connect.”
There are other forms of connection, too. Felicia Shulman, the guardian responsible for protecting the show’s child actors, has tried to knit the four youngest members of the cast together through group texts and FaceTime. “Keeping them all in touch is something that I think is very important during this time of the unknown,” she said.
There’s also a newsletter of sorts. Aaron Kaburick, an actor who plays several minor characters including a “Chef Louis,” distributes a weekly email. It was originally called “Chicken on the Block,” a reference to the show’s spatchcocking scene; it’s now called “Chicken on the Couch,” because of the quarantine. The publication is just a few sentences — fabricated gossip, inside jokes, the ensemble member Doreen Montalvo’s recipe for “Quarantine Coquito” and a “Doubtfire”-choreography-inspired workout routine from Casey Garvin, an understudy.
And there are ongoing get-togethers. Fauxpening was three weeks and three days after the closing, so, at Gambatese’s suggestion, the company decided to plan another reunion every three weeks and three days. The second one was late last month. “It was adorable,” McClure said. “We shouted over one another.”
‘It’s so empty, it’s unreal.’The Stephen Sondheim Theater, where “Doubtfire” was being staged, exhibits many of Broadway’s real estate complexities. Its history, and its facade on West 43rd Street, go back to 1918, but the interior, which opened in 2009, is underground, beneath the 55-story Bank of America Tower at One Bryant Park.
The 1,055-seat theater is operated by a nonprofit, the Roundabout Theater Company, which is renting it to the commercial producers of “Mrs. Doubtfire.”
The building is still “Doubtfire”-branded, with a marquee and pastel-colored posters promoting the show. But there are also signs of the times: Anita’s Way, a pedestrian passage alongside the theater, has become, with the disappearance of pedestrians, a resting spot for the homeless.
The only person still regularly going inside is Deosarran, a one-named 58-year-old Guyanese immigrant who works for Roundabout as a building engineer.
Once or twice a week, Deosarran — everyone calls him Dino — gets into his car and drives in to Times Square from his home in Harrison, N.J., to make his rounds at the four theaters Roundabout operates in Midtown. He starts early — around 5 a.m. — to increase the ease of social distancing, and he checks the buildings’ temperature, the humidity, the plumbing and even the roofs.
“In the beginning I was nervous, but I bought some masks and gloves and I mingle with no one,” said Deosarran, who moved to the United States at age 14, took a job pumping gas and has been working in Broadway theaters for most of his adult life. “It’s very strange to see these theaters with no show. On 42nd Street you see one or two people walking. It’s unbelievable.”
There are other eyes on the building — security, cops and a few less expected observers. Connie Robinson, the manager of theater operations for Roundabout, monitors by video camera from her home in the Bronx while baking up a storm — sweet potato buns, banana pudding cheesecake, crepes. “It’s so empty, it’s unreal,” she said.
And James Kabel, the wardrobe supervisor, walks over from his apartment in Times Square. He gazes at the “Doubtfire” images on the theater’s windows, just “to make sure it’s not just a dream.”
‘I’m not going to imagine anything but that it’s going to happen.’It was one of the first scenes the writers cooked up: Deep in the second act, Daniel Hillard would have a nightmare in which he is haunted by multiple Mrs. Doubtfires, forcing him to confront his feelings of inadequacy.
The power rock song, “You’ve Created a Monster,” was rousingly sung, wild to look at (a stageful of Doubtfires!), and regularly prompted applause. But gnawing at the creative team was the sense that it stopped the storytelling.
The problem: The number as written suggested that Daniel Hillard’s big fear was that Mrs. Doubtfire was better than him. But the musical is fueled by his more fundamental terror: that he would lose his children.
So, in one of the surest signs that Team “Doubtfire” fully expects the show to return, the now-dispersed creative team, who previously collaborated on “Something Rotten!”, overhauled the song via Skype. Wayne Kirkpatrick, back home in Nashville; his brother, Karey Kirkpatrick, in Los Angeles; and John O’Farrell, in London.
So they decided to refocus the scene. “You can’t have a song that’s not moving the story forward,” Karey Kirkpatrick said. “So we made it about the kids — they’re no longer dressed as Doubtfires, and there are lyric changes to support the storytelling.”
And they set about shortening the musical’s ending. “You want to leave them wanting more, as opposed to saying get on with it already,” Karey Kirkpatrick said.
Trimming was not easy because in the final 12 minutes McClure has six costume changes, from Hillard to Doubtfire and back again — and each one takes at least 23 seconds. But the writers now have a series of proposed cuts they want to test whenever they get back to the stage.
“If you just listen, the show will tell you what it needs,” Karey Kirkpatrick said.
It’s unclear what happens next. Industry leaders say that September is the earliest they can imagine Broadway resuming performances, but that it is possible shows won’t return until next year.
Broadway has multiple vulnerabilities: high costs, tightly packed seating, and a fan base that includes many tourists and seniors.
The longer the shutdown continues, the more shows are expected to close before even opening, succumbing to cash flow issues and economic concerns. Zaks, a four-time Tony winner directing on Broadway for the 25th time with “Doubtfire,” refuses even to consider that this show could be among the missing. “I’m not going to imagine anything but that it’s going to happen,” he said.
He can take solace from McCollum, the lead producer, who vows that “Doubtfire” will return. “I’m sad that everyone has to wait, but the show is ready to go, and when people gather, we’ll be ready to open,” he said. “We’re birthing this new piece, and I can’t wait to show it to the world.”
As for McClure, the show’s star, he is practicing a combination of patience and optimism.“I don’t think it would be in Broadway’s best interest to open too soon and be part of another wave of this — I don’t think anyone in our industry is interested in that,” he said. “But when I think about the first night back, when the overture starts and the curtain goes up, I choke up. I really do. It’s the culmination of everything we’re craving — more than the singing and the dancing and this great American art form, it’s a bunch of people telling a story and a bunch of people receiving a story. We’re craving the collective experience of being human. And that’s what theater is.”",real

Roughly 3,000 sailors who had been removed from the ship have returned, and for them to do so, they had to have two negative tests.

In addition to the five sailors who were removed after testing positive, another 18 sailors were also taken off the ship because they had been in close contact.

Five US Navy sailors who were cleared to return to the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt after two negative tests have tested positive for COVID-19, a defense official told Insider Thursday.

All five of the sailors have been removed from the ship, as have 18 other sailors who were in close contact with them.

The sailors, a defense official explained, had previously tested positive for the virus and were removed from the ship and placed in isolation on Guam. All five sailors completed the mandatory 14-day quarantine and tested negative twice before they were allowed to return to the ship.

The outbreak aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt began in late March with only a few cases. As of April 30, there were 1,102 cases among sailors assigned to the ship.

The virus upended the carrier's Pacific deployment, forcing it into port in Guam, where it has remained for over a month as the Navy works to get the situation under control.

Over 80% of the carrier's crew of roughly 4,800 sailors were evacuated ashore and placed in isolation in hotels and other facilities.

In recent weeks, sailors have begun returning to the ship, but only on the condition that they meet the health requirements.

""You have to go through two different checks plus being COVID tested twice,"" Capt. Carlos Sardiello, commanding officer of the USS Theodore Roosevelt, told CBS News earlier this month. ""We sideline sailors for the slightest thing. Sniffles.""

But there are some challenges.

The New York Times reported Thursday that one sailor hid a loss of smell, a key symptom of COVID-19, from medical examiners for days after returning to the ship.

In response, a sailor in the medical department sent out a message begging crewmembers to be honest. ""Please stress the importance of being truthful so we don't potentially have Covid+ aboard this ship,"" the email reportedly read.

The latest development in the USS Theodore Roosevelt saga comes as roughly 3,000 sailors have returned to the USS Theodore Roosevelt and is an indication that the fight for a healthy ship is yet to be won.",real
1021,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-news-un-maternity-wards-in-yemen-are-out-of-money/,2020-05-15,"48,000 Yemeni women could die giving birth as UN starts shutting down maternity services due to funding gap","London — The United Nations agency that runs maternity wards and maternal health services across war-torn Yemen says the program is nearly out of money. The agency notified authorities this week that it will no longer be able to support 140 of its 180 facilities in the country.

It's a new, imminent threat to medical care for women in a country ravaged by years of war and disease. The U.N. says tens of thousands of expectant mothers will be at risk of dying during childbirth if funding isn't secured.

UNFPA, the U.N.'s sexual and reproductive health agency, provides basic reproductive healthcare to hundreds of thousands of Yemeni women. The agency says that without its services, 320,000 pregnant women will be cut off from care and 48,000 could die from complications during delivery. The situation is only expected to worsen with the spread of the coronavirus.

""By cutting support to UNFPA, you've basically cut the umbilical cord of the reproductive health system in the country,"" Nestor Owomuhangi, representative for UNFPA in Yemen, told CBS News.

""It's grave,"" he said. ""It was bad before corona. We have weekly meetings, and… you can see an aura of hopelessness, given the corona that's knocking on our doors.""

World's worst humanitarian crisis

Before the coronavirus pandemic, aid groups were already calling the situation in Yemen the worst humanitarian crisis in the world. Years of brutal conflict between the Iran-backed Houthi rebels and the Saudi Arabia-backed government have decimated the country's infrastructure and led to widespread famine and disease.

""And then you have a situation where you have the coronavirus that has devastated the world, and for Yemen, we are looking at a population that has been resilient in a sense, but has gone through all kinds of catastrophes - of cholera and malnutrition - and therefore their immunity levels are low,"" Owomuhangi said.

People in Yemen already have very limited access to healthcare, with only about half of the health facilities functioning across the country. Of those, only 20% offer maternal and child health services - many of which are supported by UNFPA. If it is unable to raise more funds by July, it will be forced to close up to 90% of its services in Yemen.

""They have no health system, and there is no political organization to support them. So how hopeful are we? We only know that the hopes of the population are on us,"" Owomuhangi said.

Women's health and COVID-19

UNFPA operates a wide range of sexual and reproductive services in many countries, but in Yemen it focuses primarily on life-saving interventions during childbirth.

""It's already the minimum service,"" Arthur Erken, UNFPA's director of strategic partnerships and communications, told CBS News. ""These health facilities that lack staff, that lack supplies, that have been bombed or been severely damaged by the war, are already in a difficult state - these 140 need to stay open. Otherwise the consequences will be directly – the health and death will be directly a result of closing (them). Of course, if you have no money, that's pretty much end-of-story,"" he said.

Even before the coronavirus started spreading across the world, the agency didn't have enough funding to make it to the end of this year. When a donor conference was cancelled in April because of the pandemic, it left them in dire straits. UNFPA says it now needs $59 million to continue operations in Yemen until the end of 2020, plus another $24 million to deal with the extra burden of COVID-19 in the country.

""Women are pregnant. They were pregnant before the crisis. They're pregnant now. How do you deal with that?"" said Erken. He said the crisis can only be addressed by the international community collectively, and he urged nations to step up through the U.N., ""to make sure that being pregnant is not a death sentence in the coronavirus crisis.""

Only a few dozen cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in Yemen, but on Friday, the international healthcare nonprofit Doctors Without Borders said that, because testing capacity in the country is ""extremely limited, it is impossible to know the full extent of the spread of the virus."" The charity Save the Children said it has seen a surge in deaths of people with coronavirus symptoms in the southern city of Aden - approximately 50 people a day over the last week.

""Our hope is in the hope of the people who believe that we can make a difference,"" Owomuhangi said. ""And for that reason we have no choice but to believe that we can be able to provide support, whatever we can, not to let the population down.""",real

Republicans Say The Worst Is Over.,"Democrats Say The Worst Of The Coronavirus Is Yet To Come. Republicans Say The Worst Is Over.

Welcome to Pollapalooza, our weekly polling roundup.

Poll(s) of the week

So far, Americans have largely supported using social distancing to slow the spread of the new coronavirus. According to a Washington Post/University of Maryland poll published this week, most Americans agree that it’s necessary to wear a mask, stay at home when possible, avoid gatherings and keep 6 feet away from others in public. And while Democrats are more likely than Republicans to say these measures are important, sizable majorities in both parties still agree that they are necessary. But while Americans are mostly on the same page about current social distancing measures, there are also signs that they increasingly disagree about where the crisis is headed, with Democrats saying the worst is yet to come and Republicans saying the worst is behind us.

According to a CNN poll released this week, nearly three-quarters of Democrats said the worst of the crisis is still ahead of us, while only about a quarter of Republicans said the same. This marked a 15 percentage-point drop among Democrats since CNN last asked the question in April, and a 44-point drop among Republicans. A YouGov/Economist poll also found a similar divide this week; 58 percent of Democrats said the pandemic is going to get worse compared with only 20 percent of Republicans. (The pollster included a third choice, “We are currently in the worst part of the pandemic,” which just over 20 percent of both Democrats and Republicans chose.) And a daily tracking poll conducted by Navigator Research also found that between mid-April and early May, the share of Americans who thought the worst was yet to come declined sharply. However, that number has been ticking back up again since May 4, which may reflect increased concern that the virus will spread as more states begin to ease restrictions on businesses and public gatherings.

The polls this week also show that Americans are adjusting their expectations about when the need for social distancing is likely to end. According to the Washington Post/University of Maryland poll, two-thirds of Americans think that it will be at least the end of July before people can safely gather in groups of 10 or more, up from 45 percent who thought so a month ago. This month’s total includes 80 percent of Democrats and 54 of Republicans. And this week’s YouGov/Economist poll found that a 47 percent plurality — including a third of Republicans and almost two-thirds of Democrats — believe it will be at least September before it is safe to end social distancing measures.

Concerns about catching the virus have stayed fairly consistent over the month of May so far. According to FiveThirtyEight’s coronavirus poll tracker, the share of Americans who say they are “somewhat” or “very” concerned that they or someone they know will get sick stayed mostly steady at about 68 percent.

And the share of Americans who say they’re concerned about the virus’s impact on the economy has also stayed about the same — hovering at around 87 percent — for the past six weeks.

The share of Americans who approve of Trump’s handling of the virus response, however, has declined about 4 points over the past month, though in the shorter term his rating remains essentially unchanged, with 43.3 percent approving of the job he’s doing handling the pandemic this week and 43.5 percent approving last week.

Attitudes toward Trump’s handling of the crisis are, expectedly, very partisan, with a majority of Republicans approving and a majority of Democrats opposed. Feelings seem to be more mixed about leaders outside the federal government, however — according to a new Pew Research poll, state and local officials, on average, continue to enjoy more bipartisan support than Trump. However, Republicans appear to be souring on local and state officials’ work faster than Democrats are. For instance, since March, the share of Republicans who think their local elected officeholders are doing a “good” or “excellent” job has declined by 12 points, while the share of Democrats who say the same has remained unchanged at 66 percent. Likewise, Republican approval of the job state officials were doing declined by 12 percentage points, while Democratic approval dropped by only 5 points. Additionally, Republicans, who were more likely than Democrats to rate public health officials such as those at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention favorably in March were less likely to do so now. Sixty-eight percent of Republicans said health officials are doing a “good” or “excellent” job, down 16 points since March, while about three-quarters of Democrats felt health officials were doing a good job in both polls.

However, at this point, the majority of Americans are not yet frequenting public places — despite growing disagreement on where the coronavirus crisis is headed next. A Morning Consult poll conducted last week asked Americans about whether they’re going to public places and socializing with others, and it didn’t find much of a partisan gap in reported behavior. So for now at least, it seems like many Americans are staying put, although that might change in the coming weeks.

Other polling bites

According to a Morning Consult/Politico poll , 71 percent of voters — including 58 percent of Republicans and 82 percent of Democrats — said that the president and vice president ought to wear face masks in public places when they travel. Trump recently failed to wear a mask during a tour of a mask production facility in Phoenix, and Vice President Mike Pence didn’t wear one when visiting a coronavirus testing site at the Mayo Clinic last month, although he later said he should have (he did wear one when visiting a ventilator factory in Indiana a few days later).

A YouGov/CBS News poll found that Americans were evenly split on whether they thought the new coronavirus was “something from nature” or “created by people, on purpose,” with about two-thirds of Republicans saying it was manufactured and over two-thirds of Democrats saying it occurred naturally. Scientists have not found evidence that the virus was created.

Half of Americans said they would be “somewhat” or “very” likely to use a cell phone-based contact-tracing system to determine if they had come into contact with someone who was diagnosed with the coronavirus if the system were established by the CDC and public health officials. But the other half of respondents said they wouldn’t use such a system, according to an Ipsos/Axios poll. And if the effort were spearheaded by cell phone or internet providers, major tech companies, or the federal government, only about a third of Americans said they’d be likely to use it.

An SSRS/CNN poll conducted last week found former Vice President Joe Biden with a 5-point lead over Trump nationally, but in 15 battleground states, Trump led Biden 52 percent to 45 percent. The poll did not break out voter preference by battleground state, however; it sampled people in 15 battleground states and reported the results in aggregate. That makes it hard to know in which states Trump may have an advantage.

According to polling from the Levada Center, an independent pollster in Moscow, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s approval ratings have fallen to 59 percent, the lowest they have been in more than six years.

Trump approval

According to FiveThirtyEight’s presidential approval tracker, 43.6 percent of Americans approve of the job Trump is doing as president, while 52.0 percent disapprove (a net approval rating of -8.4 points). At this time last week, 43.3 percent approved and 51.4 percent disapproved (for a net approval rating of -8.1 points). One month ago, Trump had an approval rating of 44.3 percent and a disapproval rating of 51.4 percent, for a net approval rating of -7.1 points.

Generic ballot

In our average of polls of the generic congressional ballot, Democrats currently lead by 7.7 percentage points (48.9 percent to 41.2 percent). A week ago, Democrats led Republicans by 7.9 points (48.5 percent to 40.6 percent). At this time last month, voters preferred Democrats by 7.8 points (48.6 percent to 40.8 percent).

1480,https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-slashes-emissions-for-now/,2020-05-19,Coronavirus slashes emissions (for now),"Presidential reelection campaigns are generally referendums on the incumbent. A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump’s measures of success. But after a manic 3½ years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.

By far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. “I’m not going to play that game,” said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. “I think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they’re not uniform across states and across countries.”

But even beyond the death count, there’s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. “I’m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,” the official said.

Some Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn’t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn’t been able to focus on getting the response right.

Trump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. “So it is a war and I define victory when it’s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,” he said on May 1. “It can never be a total victory because too many people have died.”

When American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn’t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush’s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.

Others are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. “Allowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,” argued one Republican close to the president.

“The closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.” Sen. Lindsey Graham

But, he added, “If things don’t look like they’re bouncing back by September, I think that’s going to be a problem.”

The fear that Trump can’t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.

When asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump’s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the “economic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.”

A spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.

Others are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)",real
1578,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/20/coronavirus-back-to-school-272592,2020-05-20,Europe learning the dangers of going back to school after coronavirus,"It’s “one of the most difficult things” for policymakers, said Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. “It’s an impossible balancing task.""

With no easy answers, Europe hasn’t been able to settle on a consistent approach. Germany began reopening schools in April, with older students returning first. In England, it's the opposite, with primary schools poised to begin reopening in June.

In Belgium this week, those in the final years of primary and secondary school began to return to school. Italy and Spain, on the other hand, are treading much more cautiously and only reopening schools in September.

To complicate matters, parents aren’t always on board with their government’s plans. Over 500,000 Britons have signed a petition calling for the right to opt out of sending their children back to school. In Denmark, when schools began to reopen in April, some parents kept their children at home, saying they didn't want them to be “guinea pigs,” Reuters reported.

And it’s not just the children who need to be considered.

“We need to think about the risks of both opening schools and keeping them closed to children, parents, teachers and support staff,” said Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.

What all governments are scrutinizing is the science, which they hope will tell them whether it's safe to reopen schools.

When the coronavirus first emerged, it quickly became clear that children were relatively unscathed.

“In every major country, children have been very little affected by Covid-19 if you looked at the overall picture,” said Viner, speaking at a press briefing on May 13. In China, the U.S., Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and the U.K, only around 1 to 2 percent of total coronavirus cases have been in those aged under 18, he noted.

But in late April, as many governments planned their school reopening schedules, there was a new twist: a rare inflammatory disease affecting some children.

The emergence of the syndrome, described as Kawasaki-like, prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare an “urgent need” for more data on the illness. The WHO also said it's “temporarily” linking the syndrome to Covid-19, “based on initial laboratory testing showing positive serology in a majority of patients.”

But to experts such as Viner and Liz Whittaker, clinical lecturer in pediatric infectious diseases and immunology at Imperial College London, the fact that the syndrome is so rare should mean that it shouldn't influence decisions to keep children at home.

“The risk of getting severe COVID-19 in young children remains extremely low, despite this serious condition, which will affect very few,” said Whittaker at the same May 13 briefing. “It shouldn't be a factor ... when decisions are made about when and how to reopen schools.”

Policymakers aren’t just considering whether children get the virus, but how easily they may spread it — a reasonable fear given previous evidence of children being super-spreaders of illnesses such as influenza and measles.

“That’s my biggest fear,” Michael Hoelscher, head of infectious diseases and tropical medicine at Munich University Hospital, told the New York Times.

But the (limited) evidence doesn’t support this.

Ireland’s Health Information and Quality Authority has reviewed the data and found that from the small number of studies identified, “children are not, to date, substantially contributing to the household transmission of SARS-CoV-2.”

The one study that analyzed transmission in schools also showed very low spread, although the review admits that the “evidence remains limited.”





The WHO’s chief scientist, Soumya Swaminathan, told the BBC's ""Andrew Marr Show"" on May 17 that it seemed that “children are less capable of spreading it even if they get the infection.”

But it’s this lack of evidence that was cited by the British Medical Association, the U.K.’s doctors' union, when it supported the country’s National Education Union in its opposition to reopening schools before it deemed it safe to do so, reported the Guardian.

McKee, at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, thinks it is ""premature"" to reopen schools in the U.K. as the country's testing system is “problematic” and its contact-tracing system “untested.”

And some U.K. local authorities are ready to take matters into their own hands and refusing to reopen their schools, just as some mayors in France did earlier in May.

Devi Sridhar, professor and chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, believes that local-level data on levels of transmission and daily new cases is needed to inform these decisions.

“This puts information directly into [the] hands of key members of the educational community,” she wrote on Twitter. “Large national decisions [are] not optimal in these situations given variance within a country.”

When to reopen the schools has been the “most delicate” issue, said Marius Gilbert, head of the Spatial Epidemiology Laboratory at Université Libre de Bruxelles and part of the group advising the Belgian government.

It’s not just the risk of transmission increasing, Gilbert told L’Echo. He warned of another danger – that of children being cut off from all social life and being deprived of the structure that school gives them.

Harry Quilter-Pinner, senior research fellow at the Institute for Public Policy Research, agreed, calling this “probably one of the biggest disruptions we’ve faced in the last 100 years in terms of education and schooling.”

For Quilter-Pinner, the key concern is the widening of the attainment gap, which is the concept that children in deprived areas do worse than their wealthier counterparts.

Indeed, data on England from the Institute for Fiscal Studies finds that during the outbreak, students from wealthier families have been spending more time on home learning and have better access to individualized resources such as private tutoring. Their parents also feel better able to support them.

But the problems don’t stop when schools reopen.

“The challenge of reintroduction is not just how do you get people back into classrooms,” said Quilter-Pinner. “It’s how do you build on what was normal to recover and get back to where we were before.”

Returning to school will require significant logistical challenges, with the need to maintain social distancing and have fewer children in a class, he noted.

“As a society, we have choices to make,” said Quilter-Pinner, such as addressing how big the risk of reopening schools is and whether we are willing to take that risk.

Alastair Sutcliffe, professor of general pediatrics at University College London, said these decisions are based on considerations of “various known risks.”

“One of the few positive things to come out of COVID is that it very rarely kills children, especially very young children, especially healthy young children,” he said, adding that in reopening schools, we need to consider this very low risk versus other potential risks to children from not returning to school.

With no clear end to the pandemic in sight, schools will have to be reopened at some point, say experts like Gilbert at Université Libre de Bruxelles: “In any case, you will have to learn to live with the virus.”

The move is part of a longer-term bet that CEO Ed Bastian highlighted to investors last month: that consumers’ perceptions of safety will be instrumental in reviving more routine travel, and that they will be willing to pay a premium for comfort.

Specific details could still change, the people said on condition of anonymity, citing the uncertain timing of a recovery from the coronavirus crisis that has decimated air travel demand.

Delta has publicly said that it will limit first class seating capacity at 50% and main cabin at 60% through June 30, and earlier announced that it was resuming some flights next month.

“We announced a policy on seating capacity through June 30. Nothing has been decided beyond that but we are continuing to monitor the situation and make adjustments as necessary,” Delta spokesman Trebor Banstetter said.

Social distancing on airplanes has become a topic of debate. The global industry’s main group IATA has said that airlines will not be able to make a profit if they limit airplanes to two-thirds of their normal capacity, unless they drastically increased airfares.

In the United States, the chairman of the U.S. House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee last week urged airlines to maintain at least one seat between all passengers and cap seating at 67% of capacity on narrow-body airplanes.

While major U.S. airlines’ middle seat policies differ, they all require passengers to wear facial coverings, and they have all slashed their flying schedules by as much as 90% in an effort to stem a cash bleed amid withering demand.

Still, Bastian said on a quarterly investor call that fewer airplanes in the skies could be an “opportunity for us to focus more on a more premium experience.”

Industrywide, U.S. airline load factors have recently been about 33%, with some airlines reporting load factors in the 40% range as passenger traffic inches off historic lows. But it is still down about 90% over 2019 levels.

Adding more flights could bring in more revenues but also costs. Delta, which does not expect air travel to recover for two or three years, has said it aims to halve its daily cash burn to $50 million in June.

In an effort to reassure passengers, U.S. airlines have also intensified cabin cleaning protocols, in many cases using electrostatic cleaning and fogging procedures. They have also endorsed temperature screenings by the U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA), though this has yet to be implemented.",real

“We’re not gonna send in the police to arrest parishioners. People are exercising their faith, and I understand that,” the mayor said.

“But it’s a mistake to gather in large congregate settings — particularly if you have an underlying medical condition [or] you are otherwise in a vulnerable population. That’s hopefully the dialogue that we’ll be able to have with the pastor.”

Lightfoot has not hesitated to play the heavy during the pandemic.

She shut down the lakefront, the Riverwalk and the 606 Trail when Chicagoans could not be trusted to avoid gathering in large groups and drove around the city breaking up those gatherings. She cut off citywide liquor sales at 9 p.m.

Why, then, wasn’t the service at the Elim Romanian Pentecostal Church shut down?

“Our plan has always been to educate people into compliance. If we can do that, we will do that. We don’t want to take more aggressive measures unless we’re forced to do that because people are defying it,” the mayor said.

“But we’re not gonna have a circumstance where people are blatantly ignoring the rules that have been put in place to help save peoples’ lives.”

The mayor said she had a “very pleasant conversation” with Cristian Ionescu, Elim Romanian’s senior pastor, on Monday and hopes to have a follow-up conversation soon.

Last week, Elim Romanian and Logos Baptist ministries in Niles asked for a temporary restraining order preventing them from facing criminal repercussions for hosting services while vowing to impose strict social distancing measures.

Speaking in his native Romanian, Cristian Ionescu, Elim Romanian’s senior pastor, told his flock the move to hold services is “not a rebellion for the sake of rebellion” and claimed the Constitution grants them the right to worship during the COVID-19 pandemic.

“We feel that we are discriminated against,” Ionescu told the Chicago Sun-Times, noting large groups of people are allowed to shop at grocery and hardware stores. “We follow the same rules as other places that are also considered essential, and yet we cannot have more than 10 people in a service, which is ridiculous.”

On Sunday, Elim Romanian took considerable steps to adhere to the state’s social distancing and public safety guidelines: Masks, gloves and hand sanitizer were made available, temperature checks were conducted at the door, and capacity was limited to 120 worshippers, though the church’s main auditorium and overflow rooms can hold 1,300.

Roughly 70 people were in attendance, including the church leadership, band and choir.

The vast majority of congregants didn’t wear masks during the service. But almost everyone put one on before leaving. And when the service was winding down, Ionescu sternly directed his followers to stay 6 feet apart and warned against congregating outside.

“Why is this important? We are being watched,” he said. “We are being recorded.”

That is how civilized societies reward teenagers and young adults for wrapping up four years of general education. But the coronavirus changes everything, in the way money behaves in the Cyndi Lauper song “Money Changes Everything.” I wish I could be like the millions of people who can turn out a fulsome praise to make everyone feel warm and fuzzy.

Instead, I’d like to pay honor to the class of 2020 by giving them the precious gift of honesty. This crop of graduates has been lied to, probably more than any other. I should know, because for all the years they’ve lived, I was inside the machine that manufactured the lies.

This year I graduated at the age of forty-nine in my own way. After twenty years of teaching college students, I finally left my last academic job and moved on from academia. I watched twenty classes of students move through the system while these current graduates incubated. My departure was as unceremonious as their non-ceremonies are going to be.

So here’s some truth that needs to be told: Your teachers didn’t know what they were talking about most of the time. I know you may have liked many of them, but that’s a kind of Stockholm Syndrome you get from the deliberate mental work the institutions do on you. You’re in school and they are the ones to whom you are captive. That’s why they may have seemed so kind; they needed you to give them high teaching evaluations so they could be promoted.

The people who taught you English were trained by unhinged Marxists who never made them read much classic literature before throwing them in the classroom to teach you. They rarely studied any foreign languages so had no grasp of world literature or classical literature. They were trained to disregard the Christian Bible so they lacked any meaningful connection to the thousands of years that the Bible and churches influenced artistic expression. The departments that hired them wanted chatty courtiers who could talk about glossy critical theories. Search committees didn’t hire literature professors who had a broad background, largely because the people on the hiring committees lacked the range to understand what they were talking about in job interviews. So you got the teacher who showed up talking about feminist readings of Jane Austen novels, like a million other grad students.

I know this because I sat through graduate school in the 1990s and went to conference after conference with English teachers. They did master’s theses and doctoral dissertations on idiotic pet theories that fascinated their advisors. In order to fund their reckless forays into illustrated children’s literature, erotica, music videos and other esoteric tomfoolery, they held their noses and studied composition and rhetoric so they could get jobs teaching young people how to write papers. So you were the cash crop that funded their dilettantism. If they made Shakespeare, Milton, and Henry James feel accessible to you, that’s likely because they were going off the Sparknotes just as you were. They made it accessible because they only knew as much as you did about the texts.

Most of what they told you about how to write is awful advice. The “rhetorical fallacies” like the straw man, red herring, and post hoc ergo propter hoc, are actually effective forms of persuasion that have served great commentators well from Demosthenes to Malcolm X. Ad hominem attacks make the world go round, contrary to what you’ve heard; the Declaration of Independence, remember, was a long personal attack on King George III. The human mind doesn’t react well to dry, dispassionate five-paragraph essays written by people who were forbidden from using “I” and discouraged from suggesting anything interesting or new. Once you graduate from college, nobody will ever ask you to write a 5-7 page paper with a topic sentence and formulaic presentations of evidence. Your teachers had to consume large amounts of alcohol to read those papers you hated writing.

Some of your English teachers may have followed their own suffocating rules of composition. If they did, they joined the ranks of those who write 25-page articles that take four years to get into print at a peer-reviewed journal, to be read by three grad students who stumbled on it on J-STOR when they were looking for something else. Most of your English teachers, though, broke the rules if they wrote anything impactful. They rolled up their sleeves, jumped on social media, and started flinging irresponsible mud at people over topics they felt emotional about. In other words, they were like Alexander Pope, Jonathan Swift, Emile Zola, Jean-Paul Sartre, and George Orwell. Passionate people worth studying.

But no matter how much you rave about the way your English teachers loved you and changed your life, the truth is they were horrible people. I worked alongside them for two decades. These are people who would strangle kittens for tenure. They pulled childish tricks to rig their student evaluations and nominated themselves for excellence in teaching awards. For all their prattle about sexual and racial equality, they zipped their mouths about colleagues abusing students. They did nothing when tenure review boards went after minority teachers. If it seemed like you had very few teachers of color and all the ones you had focused on ethnic studies, that’s because all the classicists of color were driven out of the academy for being self-hating Uncle Toms. Trust me. I lived that ugly routine at four different colleges.

You may think of yourself as liberal or conservative, but you’re probably neither. If you were a true leftist, you’d be staging protests against the abusive student debt and the hideous labor conditions of academia. You’d care about the adjuncts who teach 70% of your classes. When I was in college we built shanties to protest South African apartheid and some of us shouted at deans over campus governance, instead of working with “deans of diversity” to hold harmless parades about safe spaces for people of color and transgender track and field runners. The left you know is a phony game of distraction, designed to keep you unworried about the tuition they’ve extorted from you. Most of what the left preaches, whether it’s green energy or MeToo, ends up being consumerism and celebrity culture, which is really the same thing. Buy a Taylor Swift CD to show solidarity because someone grabbed her at a concert in Colorado. Log onto Google with your smart phone to learn about windmills and solar. Let’s pretend a Twitter mobbing against someone who said something homophobic in 1991 is left-wing activism… not.

I wrote Wackos, Thugs, and Perverts in 2017 to roll out the three basic flavors of educational progressives: wackos who are simply lunatics, thugs who will engage in all kinds of unethical behavior for a quick buck or power, and perverts who project their unhealthy obsessions onto their academic expertise. That’s the left you’ve seen. You’d be triggered in a nanosecond if you had to speak to an actual radical from the 1970s who wanted to push for social change. You’d probably accuse the person of mansplaining.

Even if you think you’re conservative, you’re probably not that either. Maybe you read the Daily Wire and love hearing Ben Shapiro say “facts don’t care about your feelings.” But if you were conservative, you’d be courageous enough to stand up for traditional values. In educational settings the few self-identified “conservatives” tend to come in three flavors: creeps, cretins, and cowards. The creeps were the libertarian profiteers who saw money to be made in the aftermath of pseudo-liberal destruction in the academic world; they make a living by dressing-up pro-corporate propaganda in Christian platitudes so it can be sold as Reagan’s three-legged stool to people who have no memory of what that was. The cretins were conservatives who had no concept of wolves in sheep’s clothing, and glommed onto numerous creeps (see prior sentence). The cowards were people who knew what traditional values were but didn’t want to jeopardize their chance of going to Harvard Law School or something.

All three of these conservative characters were completely useless. That’s why their movement got nowhere even as Ben Shapiro got invited to speak at campus after campus.

Whether you thought of yourself as conservative or liberal, you were really pseudo-libertarian, which is the default setting of both the Millennials and Generation Z. You wanted the experience of low-cost piety and reckless self-righteous adventures that involved no risk to yourself. You wanted to be able to snitch on your teachers and get them fired but you also wanted a small and non-intrusive government that would allow your gay classmates to make out at the senior prom. This is not your fault. During the last twenty years the entire educational system was rigged to foster that behavior in you because it kept you self-absorbed and ultimately unwilling to question the status quo. Other generations, like mine, rebelled against our teachers to feel cool. Your generations aped and flattered your supposedly progressive teachers to feel rebellious, which wasn’t necessarily cool, just the perpetually new normal.

As you get ready to start the next phase of your life, you are blessed to have had coronavirus overshadow your graduation. You have had a wakeup call that I haven’t seen students receive in twenty years. When I tried to explain to previous classes that experts were not as knowledgeable and all-powerful as people assumed they were, they wouldn’t believe me. The whole system told them that the APA, AMA, NEA, MLA, ALA, NEH, NIH, CDC, DOJ, and the rest were the gold standard. Now you’ve had your commencement canceled because these experts said everyone had to stay home for two months, since they couldn’t think of anything else to do about a virus. You sat at home wasting day after day with nothing to do while the experts couldn’t pull together a large-scale triage system, distribute reliable antibodies tests, or find treatment for people who got infected. After billions in science funding, this. If you’re paying attention, you’ve realized they’re a clown show.

What might feel scary to you could also become a sense of liberation. You hold a golden place of history. God gave you a graduation present: insight into the inner workings of a society that had spent at least sixty years convincing itself that their lies were real. In truth, human beings are still fragile organisms who can’t be saved by experts, degrees, courses of study, diplomas, transcripts, papers, conferences, or grades. People who seemed all-powerful and unquestionable to classes that came before you now stand exposed for being less than a wizard behind a curtain. They’re the bobblehead behind a telescreen (pace Orwell).

Please forgive me for speaking so frankly to you. You’ve been had. But you can’t be had any longer, since everything is breaking down. You didn’t ask for my advice but I’ll give it to you. You should stand up and fight the system at this point, whether you’re left or right. Past generations risked their safety to engage in real civil disobedience. Read Thoreau if it helps. When you’re young and not set in your career, you have more freedom than you can imagine. I wish I’d taken a stand for my beliefs at 19, so I didn’t have to take the stand at 49 with two kids, a wife, and a mortgage to worry about. I don’t regret my choices but my timing. If you don’t avail yourself of your freedom now, chances are you’ll be part of the machine for the rest of your life. And the machine is broken.

Sarasota Herald-Tribune

SARASOTA, Fla. — Facing an explosive charge that his administration is manipulating coronavirus data to help make the case for reopening Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis played down the controversy Tuesday as a “nonissue.”

Florida’s COVID-19 death toll topped 2,000 Tuesday, underscoring the serious threat posed by the coronavirus and the potential consequences of not giving people accurate information on the risks involved.

Health experts say the milestone should serve as a sobering reminder to exercise caution as the state reopens, and DeSantis has presented his reopening plan as a “safe” and “step by step” approach. But the accusations levied by Rebekah Jones, a data expert at the Florida Department of Health, could undercut the governor’s reopening push.

Jones wrote in an email last week that she no longer was overseeing the state’s COVID-19 dashboard, which she built and managed for two months.

""As a word of caution, I would not expect the new team to continue the same level of accessibility and transparency that I made central to the process during the first two months,” Jones wrote. “After all, my commitment to both is largely (arguably entirely) the reason I am no longer managing it.""

But DeSantis said at a Tuesday news conference that Jones sent an email to her supervisor saying the comments were being misinterpreted.

“I don’t know who she is but they gave me an email that she sent to her supervisor, said that, ‘Uh oh, I may have said something that was misrepresented,’” DeSantis said.

He added that Jones went on to write: “I said they’ve got a team working on it now and what I meant when I said don’t expect the same level of accessibility is that they are busy and can’t answer every single email they get right away and that it was ridiculous that I managed to do it in the first place and that I was tired and needed a break from working two months straight.""

Jones told Florida Today that she was fired on Monday. And she said in an email to the CBS12 television station in West Palm Beach that she faced blowback because she refused to ""manually change data to drum up support for the plan to reopen.""

DeSantis spokeswoman Helen Aguirre Ferré, in a separate statement after the news conference, said Jones was fired for ""insubordination."" (Her complete statement is also at bottom.)

Jones ""exhibited a repeated course of insubordination during her time with the Department, including her unilateral decisions to modify the Department’s COVID-19 dashboard without input or approval from the epidemiological team or her supervisors,"" Ferré said.

""The blatant disrespect for the professionals who were working around the clock to provide the important information for the COVID-19 website was harmful to the team,"" she added. ""Accuracy and transparency are always indispensable, especially during an unprecedented public health emergency such as COVID-19.

""Having someone disruptive cannot be tolerated during this public pandemic, which led the Department to determine that it was best to terminate her employment.""

Asal M. Johnson, an assistant professor of Public Health at Stetson University, told Florida Today that she worried DOH is trying ""to undermine evidence-based decision making to prioritize (the) economy.""

Florida Democratic Party Chair Terrie Rizzo called for an independent investigation into the alleged data manipulation.

“Allegations that Florida’s government may have tried to manipulate or alter data to make reopening appear safer is outrageous,” Rizzo said. “These kinds of actions are dangerous and, frankly, should be criminal.”

Florida Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried, the only statewide elected Democrat, wrote a letter to DeSantis requesting that members of his administration appear at the state’s next Cabinet meeting to answer questions about the accusations levied by Jones.

“These actions undermine public trust in our government, are extraordinarily dangerous to public health, and are absolutely inconsistent with the transparency and accuracy that Floridians expect and deserve during this pandemic,” Fried wrote.

Meanwhile, the Florida Department of Health reported 55 more COVID-19 deaths Tuesday, bringing the statewide total to 2,052.

“In a rather short period of time we lost over 2,000 people in Florida to COVID-19, a disease we hadn’t even heard of before this year,” said Dr. Marissa Levine, a professor of public health and family medicine at the University of South Florida who leads the school’s Center for Leadership in Public Health Practice.

“As we work to reopen Florida it is critical for us all to remember that we each have a role in controlling this pandemic. Our individual and collective actions will determine the course of this pandemic in our own communities and will be the key as to whether we experience an even greater spike of disease and death in the coming months.”

Florida health officials reported the state’s first COVID-19 death on March 6, meaning it took 74 days to top 2,000 deaths.

The novel coronavirus has become one of the leading causes of death in Florida in just over two months. Based on 2018 death totals, 2,052 deaths would rank 16th among Florida’s top causes of death, above homicides and HIV.

Influenza and pneumonia killed 3,082 people in Florida in 2018. The coronavirus could top that this year.

Florida health officials are reporting a steady stream of new coronavirus cases, and more deaths are sure to follow.

The state’s coronavirus case total rose by 502 Tuesday to 46,944.

Floridians should be careful as they emerge from a month-long lockdown, said Levine, who previously served as Virginia’s state health commissioner.

“We know the virus is still circulating in our communities in Florida as well as around the nation and the globe,” Levine said. “Although we don’t have complete information, our best estimates tell us that many in our communities still remain vulnerable to the virus.

""Given Florida’s demographics and the burden of chronic disease in the population, many of us are at high risk of serious complications and even death.”

DeSantis began lifting Florida’s lockdown earlier this month. He has focused on the fact that the state’s health care system has not been overwhelmed, as some models predicted, and hospitals have plenty of available beds.

DeSantis touted his reopening strategy during a press conference in Orlando Monday. He has branded it the “Safe. Smart. Step by Step.” plan as he seeks to avoid criticism that he is moving too fast, something public health officials are warning against.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, said during a U.S. Senate hearing last week that “the consequences could be really serious” if states reopen “prematurely.”

“I’m just looking forward to helping bring us back,” DeSantis said Monday. “Obviously we still have issues with public health; that’s not going to go away, but I think we have a pathway to get Florida moving again.”

DeSantis is pushing a phased reopening that accelerated this week when gyms, libraries and museums were allowed to welcome people at 50% capacity. Restaurants and other retail establishments were allowed to increase from 25% to 50% occupancy.

The governor also allowed barbershops and hair salons to reopen last week, and many municipalities have reopened beaches.

Public health experts worry that the number of new cases and deaths could spike if the state reopens and people don’t continue to practice social distancing and take other precautions.

“Our only tools to deal with this have remained the same: Physical distancing (including cloth face coverings) and aggressive hygienic practices,“ Levine said. ”Our ability to adapt and incorporate those practices into our everyday lives will determine the success of our reopening.

""I am hopeful that we will not interpret reopening as a return to the normal we once knew, but rather to a new normal that incorporates the adaptations we need to implement to protect one another.”

Now, amid the ongoing novel coronavirus pandemic, she and her colleagues are also checking in on their elderly neighbors, pooling money together for groceries to help those who can’t afford them, and translating health information on the novel coronavirus for Spanish-speaking residents. The work is different, but it’s still connected to her fight for clean air.

The older people who live in Little Village are already more vulnerable to COVID-19 because of their age. But the ones who grew up here also spent most of their lives breathing in air laden with the soot from nearby coal power plants, she explains. “You have a legacy of toxic exposure paired with a lot of social vulnerability, that means that the same pound of pollution impacts different people differently,” says Pino, a policy director for the Little Village Environmental Justice Organization, which successfully campaigned to close the coal power plants in 2012.

“Inequities have real consequences and COVID-19 will show that.”

The novel coronavirus is changing nearly every aspect of life in places with an outbreak. Like any disaster, the COVID-19 pandemic will hit some people harder than others. Since it’s a disease that affects the lungs, people who live in places with way more air pollution could be more vulnerable. This pollution tends to be worse in communities with more poverty, people of color, and immigrants.

When it comes to the US, “We’re the richest country in the world yet we have some of the greatest inequities. These inequities have real consequences and COVID-19 will show that,” John Balmes, a physician and a spokesperson for the American Lung Association, tells The Verge. “The air pollution interacts with multiple other factors that increase risk,” he says.

4. It is directly related to our fight for clean air, clean water, a healthy environment, and healthy communities.#COVID19 is affecting all of us—our health and our way of life, but low-income communities and communities of color may face added risk. — Gina McCarthy (@GinaNRDC) March 16, 2020

Severe cases of COVID-19 can lead to pneumonia, which can kill. The disease is deadliest in older people and those with preexisting health conditions that make it harder to breathe or fight off the infection. Even without a pandemic, living with air pollution has been linked to higher rates of lung disease like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in populations. High levels of air pollution have also been linked to larger numbers of people hospitalized with pneumonia, studies in the US and China have found.

During the 2003 SARS outbreaks, which was caused by another coronavirus, patients from places with the highest levels of air pollution were twice as likely to die from SARS compared to those who lived in places with little pollution, a study on SARS cases in China found. Even moderately bad air pollution significantly increased the risk of death.

There isn’t data yet on how air pollution is playing into the current pandemic, but Balmes points out that international hotspots for COVID-19 — Wuhan, Northern Italy, and South Korea — have pretty high levels of air pollution. He believes air pollution may be one reason, although not the primary factor, for why outbreaks in those places have been so devastating.

Another data point from China backs up the air pollution hypothesis. More men have died from the novel coronavirus in China than women, and there’s been some speculation that this could be because fewer women there smoke. If smoking does put someone at higher risk, then the same is probably true of air pollution, Ana Navas-Acien, a physician-epidemiologist at Columbia University, tells The Verge. “If we extrapolate from there, we could speculate that maybe individuals, communities that have higher air pollution levels could also be at higher risk of developing a more severe infection,” she says. “It’s a hypothesis at least worth testing.”

In places like Chicago’s Little Village neighborhood, the COVID-19 pandemic is piling on top of other stressors. Social distancing immediately took its toll on the city’s street vendors, a majority of whom live in the neighborhood, according to Pino. “It’s like today, right now, they can’t afford the groceries because they would have taken that day’s cash to go get supplies,” says Pino. “It’s those folks in really precarious day-to-day situations that the community’s rallying around — even still, it’s not enough,” she says.

higher risks and fewer resources

Air pollution was already a problem in the area and so was making ends meet. That’s a double whammy of higher risk and fewer resources. “Researchers call this the double jeopardy hypothesis and it can be extended to something like the novel coronavirus pandemic we are now facing,” Anjum Hajat, an epidemiologist at the University of Washington, said in an email to The Verge. That “double jeopardy” is often used to describe disadvantages that elderly people of color face because of both their age and race.

Balmes also worries about how poor housing and not enough green space or healthy foods in polluted neighborhoods increase risks. Some immigrants may have an even harder time getting care because of the fear of deportation, he fears.

Fewer cars on the road and planes in the air have temporarily curbed pollution in China, Italy, and California. But it doesn’t erase the decades’ worth of damage that’s been done. That’s why, Pino says, “we need to see targeted, prioritized help to the communities that are being hit hard now.”",real

In Arizona, use of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for prophylaxis in medical workers is “strictly forbidden” by Executive Order of Gov. Doug Ducey unless peer-reviewed evidence becomes available. In all but four states, prescribing or dispensing HCQ for COVID-19 is restricted.

We have known about COVID-19 for about four months; it can take years to plan, complete, and publish a randomized, double-blind controlled study. However, in 2005, the CDC Special Pathogens Branch described three mechanisms by which chloroquine might work and have both a prophylactic and therapeutic role in coronavirus infections. More than 20 relevant studies have been published in journals indexed in PubMed between Jan 28 and April 20, 2020.

AAPS concludes that: “the safety of Hydroxychloroquine is well documented. When the safe use of this drug is projected against its apparent effect of decreasing the progression of early cases to ventilator use, it is difficult to understand the reluctance of the authorities in charge of U.S. pandemic management to recommend its use in early COVID-19 cases.”

Additionally, AAPS is compiling observational results reported from China, France, South Korea, Algeria, and the U.S. Of 2,333 patients treated with HCQ, 2,137 or 91.6 percent improved clinically. There were 63 deaths, all but 11 in a single retrospective report from the Veterans Administration where the patients were severely ill.

Apr 27 data show that U.S. COVID-19 death rates are at least eight times higher than in countries with early and prophylactic use of HCQ.

Country # of cases # of deaths Deaths/million Use of HCQ India 27,890 881 0.6 Early and prophylactic Costa Rica 695 6 1.0 Early and prophylactic Australia 6,716 83 3.0 Early and prophylactic South Korea 10,728 242 5.0 Early and prophylactic Brazil 62,859 4,271 20.0 Early and prophylactic Israel 15,443 201 23.0 Early, some prophylactic use U.S. 987,160 55,413 167.0 Late, in hospitalized patients

Opinion leaders should be demanding to know why this treatment option is not widely discussed or might even be forbidden.

1802,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/22/trump-churches-essential-coronavirus-274763,2020-05-22,"Trump declares houses of worship ‘essential,’ pressuring governors to let them reopen","Trump emphasized he was instructing governors to allow places of worship to resume operations “right now,” and warned that “if there’s any question, they’re going to have to call me — but they are not going to be successful in that call.”

It is unclear whether the president is legally empowered to compel the nation’s governors to take such an action. If the White House moves to enforce his order in defiance of opposition by local officials, Trump could force a constitutional clash over one of the fundamental freedoms enshrined in the First Amendment.

Challenged on Trump’s authority to unilaterally reopen places of worship, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said at the briefing Friday the administration would “leave it to faith communities to reopen,” and pointed to “detailed guidance” from the federal government “about the way you can clean your facility [and] promote social distancing.”

But soon after his remarks at the White House, the president was confronted with resistance from state and local executives. Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo said she would not alter her state’s plans to reopen places of worship on May 30, and Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot also announced her city would ignore Trump’s demand.

“By no means can the president order any locality, any state to do something that he doesn’t have the power to do,” Lightfoot said. “And he can’t do that here.”

The CDC’s guidelines, released after weeks of internal debate and scrutiny over leaked drafts, offered detailed measures for how places of worship can start to safely reopen, while advising them to consult with state and local authorities. In contrast with the earlier leaked guidelines, the agency didn’t recommend a phased reopening and instead laid out recommendations for how faith-based communities can promote safety, hygiene and social distancing.

For instance, the agency suggested groups consider suspending or decreasing how often choirs are used, as well as congregant singing and chanting during a service “if appropriate within the faith tradition.” It also recommended temporary limits on sharing religious objects, like books or cups, and to instead photocopy or email prayers to attendees.

Public health experts have expressed concern about the risks related to reopening places of worship. At least two churches in Georgia and Texas that had recently reopened shut down again this week after members tested positive for the virus, and a report from the CDC earlier this week documented how an early March outbreak in a rural Arkansas church spread from a pastor and his wife to about three dozen parishioners, killing three.

Still, Trump insisted Friday that Americans are nevertheless “demanding to go to church and synagogue or to their mosque,” and he predicted “the ministers, pastors, rabbis, imams and other faith leaders will make sure that their congregations are safe” when they gather.

“They don’t want anything bad to happen to them or to anybody else,” Trump said. “The governors need to do the right thing and allow these very important, essential places of faith to open right now, for this weekend. If they don’t do it, I will override the governors. In America, we need more prayer, not less.”

Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, stressed the importance of practicing mitigation measures as places of worship reopen, and said community faith leaders should be in touch with their local health departments.

“I think what we are trying to say with the CDC guidance is there is a way for us to work together to have social distancing and safety for people, so that we decrease the amount of exposure that anyone would have to asymptomatic [people],” she said. “And I see it that way because I know all of you and all of Americans, if they didn’t feel well, they wouldn’t go to church that day.”",real
1164,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/democrats-push-new-3t-coronavirus-relief-bill-through-house,2020-05-16,Democrats push new $3T coronavirus relief bill through House,"WASHINGTON — Democrats have powered a massive $3 trillion coronavirus relief bill through the House, an election-year measure designed to brace a U.S. economy in free fall and a health care system struggling to contain a pandemic still pummeling the country.

Friday’s 208-199 vote, with all but one Republican opposed, advances what boils down to a campaign-season display of Democratic economic and health-care priorities. It has no chance of becoming law as written, but will likely spark difficult negotiations with the White House and Senate Republicans. Any product would probably be the last major COVID-19 response bill before November’s presidential and congressional elections.

The enormous Democratic measure would cost more than the prior four coronavirus bills combined. It would deliver almost $1 trillion for state and local governments, another round of $1,200 direct payments to individuals and help for the unemployed, renters and homeowners, college debt holders and the struggling Postal Service.

“Not to act now is not only irresponsible in a humanitarian way, it is irresponsible because it’s only going to cost more,” warned House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. “More in terms of lives, livelihood, cost to the budget, cost to our democracy.”

Republicans mocked the bill as a bloated Democratic wish-list that was dead on arrival in the GOP-led Senate and, for good measure, faced a White House veto threat. Party leaders say they want to assess how $3 trillion approved earlier is working and see if some states’ partial business reopenings would spark an economic revival that would ease the need for more safety net programs.

Republicans are also sorting through internal divisions and awaiting stronger signals from President Donald Trump about what he will support.

“Phase Four is going to happen,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office, using Washington insider-speak for the measure. “But it’s going to happen in a much better way for the American people.”

Trump and top Republicans like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., are insisting the next measure should protect reopening businesses from liability lawsuits. The president is also demanding a cut to payroll taxes, but GOP leaders are not yet onboard.

The daylong debate painted a Capitol scene that’s become common in the era of coronavirus, even as it remains disconcerting. The sparsely populated House floor was dotted with lawmakers and aides wearing protective masks and even gloves, though some Republicans lacked them.

Many members looked shaggier and sported beards they had not worn weeks ago. Roll call votes lasted over an hour each because lawmakers were voting in small groups to limit crowding.

To enhance the bill’s political impact, Democrats named their measure “The Heroes Act” for the payments it would provide front-line emergency workers. With more than 86,000 Americans dead, 1.4 million confirmed infections and 36 million filing unemployment claims in an frozen economy, Democrats saw GOP opposition as an easy campaign-season target.

“Are you kidding me?” said Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, of Republican assertions that it was time to stop spending more money. “Where do you guys live? Food lines at our food banks around the block? In the United States of America?”

Republicans saw the bill as a Democratic political blunder. They said overly generous unemployment benefits discouraged people from returning to work, and attacked language helping immigrants in the U.S. illegally get federal benefits. They also singled out provisions helping states set up voting by mail and easing the marijuana industry’s access to banks.

“It may help the cannabis industry, but it won’t help Main Street,” said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.

Pelosi pushed the measure through after overcoming party divisions aggravated by election pressures. Some moderate Democrats opposed the package for its price tag and politically fraught provisions like assisting marijuana businesses. A few progressive Democrats were upset because it did not do more, such as guaranteeing workers’ salaries and bolstering their health insurance coverage.

Fourteen Democrats voted against the measure. Nearly all are centrists and number among the party’s most vulnerable lawmakers in November’s elections: freshmen from districts Trump won in 2016.

Among them was Rep. Cindy Axne of Iowa, who labeled the measure “bloated.” Another, Rep. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, tweeted, “This bill strays far beyond delivering relief or responding to an urgent crisis, & it has no chance at becoming law.”

Republicans were already planning to use the day’s votes against other moderate Democrats who backed Friday’s legislation and face competitive reelection races.

Clearly, the bipartisan consensus that produced four previous coronavirus bills was crumbling quickly. Polls show GOP voters are satisfied with the federal response and aren’t agitating for more. Self-branded deficit hawks are citing the massive increase in the spiraling $25 trillion national debt.

Some congressional aides said the Democratic bill’s real price tag could breach $3.5 trillion. A partial estimate of tax provisions alone revealed eye-popping costs: $412 billion to renew $1,200 cash payments to individuals, more than $100 billion to pay health insurance premiums for the unemployed and $164 billion to make an “employee retention” tax credit for businesses more generous.

Republicans leaders faced disunity between conservatives who feel enough has been done and pragmatists who back rescuing the Postal Service from looming insolvency and delivering cash to revenue-starved state and local governments. The huge price tag and a lack of consultation with Republicans by Pelosi cemented GOP opposition.

“This bill is nothing more than the Democratic policy agenda masquerading as a response to the coronavirus crisis,” said Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla. He said the bill is “going nowhere, and is going nowhere fast.”

Liberal Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., also opposed the bill. She told reporters that if constituents ask her if the bill would put money in their pockets or preserve their health care, “I can’t tell them yes.”

The lone Republican backing the legislation was Rep. Peter King of New York, who is retiring.",real

India reported 4,970 new cases over the previous 24 hours, taking its total to 101,139. Deaths rose by 134 to 3,163.

India’s number of cases has easily outstripped that of China, where the virus emerged late last year and which has been one of Asia’s infection hot spots.

China has reported nearly 83,000 cases but has kept its daily rise in new infections to single digits for the past week.

In contrast, new cases in India have risen by an average of more than 4,000 a day over the past week, according to a Reuters tally based on official data, despite a severe weeks-long lockdown.

India officially extended the lockdown on Sunday to May 31, although several states indicated they would allow businesses to reopen.

Health experts and officials are worried about the strain the epidemic is placing on India’s over-stretched and under-funded hospital system.

Dhruva Chaudhry, president of the Indian Society of Critical Care Medicine, told Reuters last month that India probably had only about 100,000 intensive care unit (ICU) beds and 40,000 ventilators.

Chaudhry warned there was not sufficient infrastructure or staff in the country of 1.35 billion people to handle a sharp spike in the number of critical patients.

While not every coronavirus patient needs an ICU bed, health experts worry about surging cases in India, particularly as many believe the official tally falls short of the reality.

Opinion contributor

The push to release inmates to protect populations inside and outside of prison from COVID-19 has exposed our institutional trigger finger when it comes to locking people up.

About 40% of the incarcerated population doesn’t present a public safety concern, according to a 2016 Brennan Center for Justice report. If our system was more justice oriented and less punitive, we wouldn’t now be scrambling for so many compassionate releases.

Getting “tough on crime” was supposed to rehabilitate society, clear it of repetitively malignant socioeconomic outcomes across communities and create a permanent feeling of safety. Instead it has done nothing but overcrowd prisons, making each a petri dish for COVID-19. This explosive combination of unnecessarily high incarceration rates and a global pandemic accelerates the need to create a better, more holistic approach to justice in America.

In the wake of COVID-19 and tightening state and federal budgets, there is an opportunity for significant nationwide expansion of alternatives to incarceration and detention, and impactful reform of the justice system.

COLUMN:Ben Crump: Ahmaud Arbery killing reminiscent of lynching

Here are three changes that could fundamentally redefine our criminal justice system: practicing restorative justice, implementing misdemeanor reform and passing legislation that would eliminate punishment for parole violations.

Restorative justice, not punitive justice

Punitive justice focuses primarily on punishments. Restorative justice focuses on the relationship between the offender and the victim and centers the needs of survivors in ways that the traditional court system does not.

Programs based on this approach are being used right now in youth courts, such as the Red Hook Community Justice Center and Harlem Community Justice Center, and by Impact Justice’s Restorative Justice Project. The work interrupts the cycle of offending, repairs harm caused to the victim and the community, and incorporates restorative healing circles.

Restorative justice programs have higher survivor satisfaction rates than punitive systems.

Programs like Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion in Seattle are also important. The program partners civilians with local police to divert offenders to needed resources without making an arrest.

Misdemeanor reforms

Misdemeanors make the U.S. criminal justice system a profit center. They make up 80% of state criminal dockets, putting throngs of people into U.S. jails and prisons.

COLUMN:During COVID-19 crisis, prioritize release of pregnant inmates

Misdemeanors vary in severity from jaywalking to unpaid parking tickets and third-degree assault. While the latter may need stronger consequences, facing jail time for not being able to pay a speeding ticket or jaywalking isn’t just.

Misdemeanor shouldn't be done away with, but our justice system must enforce appropriate consequences for offenses rather than disproportionate punishments.

Don't arrest for parole violations

Passing legislation that would eliminate parole violations would go a long way toward keeping people out of prisons and jails who don't belong there.

New York City's Less is More Act is a great example of how to get that done. The act, if passed, would eliminate technical parole violations. The state's taxpayers spent million of dollars last year incarcerating folks for technical parole violations. New York wouldn't be the first to take steps that eliminate parole violations. After South Carolina adopted sanctions — which included disciplinary actions outside of incarceration — violations decreased and recidivism dropped.

Permitting people to earn accelerated discharge off community supervision will responsibly shrink the number of people subject to such supervision, and allow us to concentrate our finite resources on those who are most in need of attention.

We have tried punitive measures. We’ve gotten “tough on crime,” and what has resulted are broken people, shattered communities, and a system of courts, law enforcement divisions and prison operations that depend financially on the incarceration of Americans.

COLUMN:Former felons should not be pushed out of loans under CARES Act

We cannot continue this way and consider ourselves a free and peaceful society.

Committing to restorative justice and implementing reforms will restructure the justice system, reduce the burden on the taxpayer and extend the compassionate action that has been a rallying point during COVID-19.

We’ve learned during the pandemic that how we treat each other, whether down the hall or across town, impacts our collective freedom and health; it’s time to extend generosity and love to our neighbors who have been impacted by the justice system.

I’ve sequestered myself away from friends and family, but could my company be unwittingly putting my cat at risk? While there have been some cases of animals contracting COVID-19, it’s rare — and there are precautions that pet owners can take if they’re worried about their furry family members.

Coronaviruses are zoonotic, which means that they can be passed between animals and humans. In New York City, the virus apparently jumped from an asymptomatic human to three lions and four tigers, including four-year-old tiger Nadia, that tested positive for the virus. The zoo says it expects all of the animals to make full recoveries.

Scientists still don’t know for sure what type of animal first passed the new virus to a person. A wet market, where animals, seafood, and produce are sold, in China was thought to be where the novel coronavirus first made the jump. But a January study found the first person known to get sick from the virus didn’t have contact with the market. Another study found that the genome sequence of the novel coronavirus infecting people was a 99 percent genetic match with one found in pangolins, one of the most trafficked mammals in Asia, according to the World Wildlife Fund. The pangolins might have been an intermediary carrying the virus from bats to humans. Another analysis found that the genome sequence of the novel coronavirus is 96 percent identical to a coronavirus found in bats, which have been identified as the origin of both SARS and MERS.

There has been no evidence of a pet anywhere in the world transmitting COVID-19 to a person.

Even though the virus kicked off a pandemic by being passed from one species to another, it’s not often that coronaviruses make this kind of interspecies jump and continue spreading, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There has been no evidence of a pet anywhere in the world transmitting COVID-19 to a person, according to the World Health Organization. The outbreaks happening now are the result of people passing the virus to one another. Despite that, some animal advocacy groups are worried that misguided fear of COVID-19 patients’ pets could lead to more animals abandoned and mistreated.

There have been a few cases of domestic cats and dogs testing positive for the virus after their owners became sick with COVID-19. A 17-year-old Pomeranian in Hong Kong tested “weakly positive” in February and died in March, but the dog might have simply died of old age, according to reporting from the South China Morning Post. A two-year-old German shepherd in Hong Kong tested positive after its owner came down with the disease, while another dog that lived in the same home didn’t. A cat in Hong Kong and another cat in Belgium have also tested positive. The cat in Belgium “showed clinical signs of digestive and respiratory disease,” according to information from the National Veterinary Services of Belgium.

Cats might be more susceptible to COVID-19 than dogs, according to one study conducted in China that hasn’t yet been peer-reviewed. Domestic cats that had been infected with the virus by introducing samples of it through their noses were placed in kennels next to cats that were not infected. The researchers later found that one of the previously healthy cats caught the virus after being near the infected felines, most likely through respiratory droplets — the same way humans can spread the virus through coughing and sneezing. Dogs in the study, on the other hand, seemed to be more resistant to the virus and did not pass it to one another. There was no evidence that the cats shed enough of the virus to give it to people.

Those results should be taken with a grain of salt since it was a small study of animals given high doses of the virus. They don’t “represent real-life interactions between people and their pets,” virologist Linda Saif at Ohio State University in Wooster told Nature.

If you develop COVID-19, the CDC recommends avoiding cuddles, kisses, and sharing food.

If you develop COVID-19, the CDC recommends avoiding cuddles, kisses, sharing food, and having other close contact with your pet to avoid passing the disease on to them. Ask someone else in your household to take care of your pet if that’s possible, and wash your hands before and after touching your pet if it’s a service animal or if you do have to care for it while you’re sick. The same guidelines apply if you think you might be sick but haven’t been tested or are waiting for results. Wearing a mask around your pet is also appropriate if you’re ill, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association.

Because the novel coronavirus can survive for some time on different surfaces, there is a slight chance that our furry friends could carry the virus even though they’re not infected. But the only study to date of how long the virus can persist on surfaces looked at plastic, metal, and cardboard — not animal fur. It’s usually harder for a virus to survive and spread to another person via a porous surface, like hair or fur, because it’s more likely to get trapped in the pores of the material, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association. The CDC points out that any animal can carry germs that might make a person sick, so whether there’s a pandemic or not, it’s a good idea to wash your hands after handling any animal, its food, or waste.

The bottom line is that we’ll probably need to take similar precautions with our pets as we do with our human loved ones. That means keeping a safe distance when necessary so that we can all stay healthy.",real

Opinion contributors

Americans want our country to open up safely.

We have been at this for a number of difficult weeks since the global coronavirus pandemic began, and it has taken a toll.

It has been a time of unprecedented challenge. To our health. To our jobs. To our social connections. To our health care communities.

We have sacrificed with great unity to #StayHome in order to reduce the infection rate and save lives.

We want a sense of normalcy back — to go to work, to go to restaurants, to see sports again, to send our kids to school, to hug our families — but not at the expense of the lives of our friends, families and neighbors.

We want a good economy and public safety, but we are afraid if we open too quickly, or don’t have plans to adjust if spread recurs, we will have neither.

We don’t believe we need to wait until everything is completely perfect or there is zero risk before we open again. The reality is that many states are already taking the first steps toward opening, and this must happen in the safest way possible.

Americans should still #StayHome whenever possible and continue social distancing. Now we need to get on a path to #OpenSafely that gets it right.

Still growing, contagious and lethal

COVID-19 is still spreading, but at a steadier rate. While it is shrinking in places like New York, it is still growing rapidly in some areas where there had been fewer cases. The virus is still equally contagious. The virus is still lethal to many. The virus still spreads through unsuspecting asymptomatic people. Some places are especially hard hit: nursing homes, meatpacking plants, prisons, detention centers, public housing, and the communities around them as people move in and out. People are still dying at an alarming rate, and that will continue unless we follow the path like the one outlined by Dr. Deborah Birx at the White House: a steady, gated reopening that avoids accelerated growth in cases, hospitalizations and deaths.

Tens of millions of Americans are now out of work. Many businesses have closed; others are in danger. Americans are facing hunger and the inability to pay their rent or mortgage at levels not seen here since the Great Depression. Congress and the administration have passed laws to support Americans through this, but support isn’t the same thing as a job. And the support still leaves voids that need to be filled.

Yet opening the country before we have the conditions like those outlined in the White House plan can put Americans at risk unless we take further steps. It won’t help the economy if we end up having to pull back hard or close again because the virus starts spreading toward the point where it threatens our health care systems and further disrupts our health. The things that will bring us back — consumer spending, business hiring, signing leases, travel and capital investment — won’t happen unless Americans feel confident they can do these things without a substantial risk of harm to themselves or their loved ones from getting and spreading COVID-19.

We are asking decision-makers at all levels to #OpenSafely — to move along the path of opening up our communities again as deliberately as necessary and as quickly as can be safely accomplished.

Opening up safely means:

►Following the plan laid out by Dr. Birx to begin opening communities up with two weeks of declining case counts and the other gating criteria met — or explaining how there is an alternative plan for containment if that condition is not met.

►Creating adequate diagnostic testing availability so that people who need a test can get one — particularly people with symptoms, and those without symptoms in high-risk settings like nursing homes, prisons and meatpacking plants.

►Implementing improved safety standards and protocols to avoid outbreaks and slow spreading in potential hot spots.

►Having adequate public health infrastructure to contact trace and offer voluntary isolation to contain the virus when it is detected — not necessarily to trace all cases successfully, but enough to minimize potential outbreak clusters and keep getting better over time.

►Protecting vulnerable and at-risk populations and hard-hit communities, and not putting essential workers at needless risk.

►Obtaining sufficient personal protective equipment (PPE) to protect our first responders and health care workforce, including by expanding access to testing in the community

Pause if care capacity is threatened

As the reopening process begins and moves forward, states should be carefully monitoring hospitalization trends and their hospital capacity. If the rise in cases is on track to threaten hospitals’ capacity to care for COVID-19 or other acutely ill patients in the state, states should immediately take steps to slow or pause reopening efforts. The lag between infection and serious complications is typically eight days or more, so there is little time to wait if such trends emerge.

Additional important areas to make progress on that will reduce risk of transmission and support continued opening up:

►Widespread use of high-quality masks.

►Surge capacity in the health care system with sufficient PPE to protect health care workers.

►Evidence-based mitigation measures and screenings in offices and public spaces, using guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or comparable ones.

►Controls at major air and rail entry points.

►Continuous monitoring at the state and county level for indications of potential emerging outbreaks, including symptom-checking apps, digital thermometers and other syndromic surveillance tools as they become available.

►Test, trace and isolate most active cases and their closest contacts, using vacant hotel space where necessary.

►Coordinated response with neighboring states.

►Widespread use of telemedicine to improve health care access and reduce the use of PPE.

►Readiness to respond quickly to new community spread.

Safest to carefully open up

Areas that can most safely open up (with appropriate distancing and risk mitigation steps) if states have met the Dr. Birx gating criteria but have not yet initiated the reopening process are:

►Doctor offices, clinics and surgery centers with sufficient community PPE.

►Workplaces like retail and manufacturing.

►Parks and other outdoor recreation, lakes, gardens and bike trails.

►Shopping areas and coffee shops where people don’t congregate in large numbers or for extended periods.

►Outdoor weddings and funerals with small groups that physically distance and wear masks when close together.

Additional areas that we hope can open up successfully under significantly modified conditions, but that will benefit from further technical assessment on how processes should be modified that would allow them to operate with lower risks:

►Day care centers

►Summer camps and youth sports

►Restaurants

►Schools

►Movie theaters and small entertainment venues

►Sporting events with very limited or no crowds

►TV and film production

►Colleges and universities

►Bars

Areas that should remain closed until risks can be significantly reduced:

►Large-scale events like concerts, sports with high attendance

►Large conventions and other activities involving significant travel and congregation

We believe these lists can be refined and adjusted locally based on conditions, proximity to hot spots, density and other factors.

We are asking public officials and decision-makers to #OpenSafely by quickly getting the conditions in place so we can move forward. We are encouraged that other countries, including Germany, Italy and New Zealand, as well as parts of the United States, are implementing strategies to begin to open safely and closely monitor a step-by-step opening. We believe a safe step-by-step opening can happen across the United States.

We believe Americans want to remain united in the fight against COVID-19, as we were in the initial response after 9/11. We can overcome this epidemic with smart policies and committed actions.

Ambrosio Medrano released from prison over coronavirus concerns,"Former Chicago Ald. Ambrosio Medrano, convicted three times in corruption scandals, left prison this week as part of an effort to release inmates who are at-risk of contracting the coronavirus.

Federal Bureau of Prisons records show Medrano has been assigned to a residential re-entry management office in the Chicago area. Gal Pissetzky, the attorney who defended Medrano when he was sentenced in federal court six years ago, said Medrano is in a halfway house.

But for the rest of Medrano’s sentence, Pissetzky said, “he’s going to be on home confinement.” Medrano’s official release date isn’t until Sept. 14, 2025, prison records show.

A Bureau of Prisons spokesman said Medrano made the move Wednesday, transferring to “community confinement” from a federal prison camp in Duluth, Minnesota.

Pissetzky said prison officials identified Medrano, 66, as someone who met the criteria for compassionate release amid the coronavirus pandemic. He said Medrano did not file any paperwork with the Bureau of Prisons seeking the transfer.

Early in 2014, two federal judges presiding over separate cases handed Medrano a total of 13 years in prison over corrupt deals involving bribes and kickbacks.

Having already been handed a 2 ½-year sentence in the 1990s for accepting bribes on the City Council, a federal judge told Medrano he had pulled off an “unprecedented . . . corruption trifecta.”

Former Cook County Commissioner Joseph Mario Moreno, a co-defendant in one of Medrano’s cases, is also seeking compassionate release due to the coronavirus. Moreno is not due out of prison until January 2024.

1504,https://news.yahoo.com/cdc-coronavirus-mainly-spreads-through-persontoperson-contact-and-does-not-spread-easily-on-contaminated-surfaces-153317029.html,2020-05-19,CDC: Coronavirus mainly spreads through person-to-person contact and 'does not spread easily' on contaminated surfaces,"The CDC has updated guidelines on coronavirus' spread, saying that it's ""not likely"" to spread through surfaces.

Even before COVID-19 officially had a name, public health officials said the virus could be transmitted through infected respiratory droplets and by touching infected surfaces and then touching your nose, mouth, and possibly your eyes. So, people began snatching up face masks, wearing gloves, and ramping up hand hygiene to try to protect themselves.

While touching infected surfaces has always been part of the messaging on how the virus spreads, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently shifted its stance online. The CDC now says that COVID-19 spreads from person to person contact, and then lists touching infected surfaces under a section titled, ""The virus does not spread easily in other ways."" The CDC adds: “This is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads, but we are still learning more about this virus.” The language is a subtle change from the organization’s warning in early March, when it wrote simply that it “may be possible” to spread the virus through contaminated surfaces.

The CDC, which did not respond to Yahoo Life’s request for comment, still recommends that you wash your hands often with soap and water, and routinely clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces to protect yourself and others from the virus.

The CDC’s lesser emphasis on infected surfaces as part of the spread of COVID-19 is slightly different from that of the World Health Organization (WHO). The WHO states online that “COVID-19 spreads primarily from person to person,” but adds that, “it can also spread if you touch contaminated objects and surfaces.” The WHO even breaks down for readers all of the commonly-touched surfaces to be wary of, like doorknobs, computers, elevator buttons, and pens, noting that “If you touch something contaminated and then touch your face… you might fall ill.”

So what does this mean, exactly?

Dr. Richard Watkins, an infectious disease physician in Akron, Ohio, and a professor of internal medicine at the Northeast Ohio Medical University, tells Yahoo Life that it’s important to keep in mind that COVID-19 is a new virus. “We are still learning about this new coronavirus —including how it spreads — and knowledge is increasing daily,” he says. With that, some guidance and information on the virus may change over time, he says.

There has been no new, major study to suggest that contaminated surfaces are less important in the spread of COVID-19, but epidemiological data (which is the method used to find the causes of health outcomes and diseases in populations) has simply found that person-to-person contact is more important, infectious disease expert Dr. Amesh A. Adalja, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, tells Yahoo Life.

“Based on the epidemiology, we know that the main way this virus is infecting people is from direct contact with other infected people,” Adalja says. “Contaminated surfaces play some role, but it’s likely much smaller.” It also makes sense, too, he says: “This is a respiratory virus, and respiratory viruses largely spread through breathing in infected respiratory droplets.”

Concerns about contracting the virus from infected surfaces mostly stemmed from a study published in The New England Journal of Medicine in mid-March. That study found that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can last on a variety of surfaces for anywhere from four hours (copper) to three days (plastic and stainless steel). What the study didn’t find was whether people could actually become infected from touching those surfaces. But, since the study’s release, people have been nervous about handling mail, groceries, and other high-touch surfaces like doorknobs.

But the CDC’s shift in guidance doesn’t mean you should stop being cautious with those things, Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist and professor at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, tells Yahoo Life. “If I had to pick the things to pick an emphasis on to reduce the spread of COVID-19, it would still be social distancing, wearing masks, and practicing good hand hygiene,” he says. Schaffner compares the spread of COVID-19 to roadways. “Person-to-person contact is a highway, and the inanimate environment is a byway. Touching infected surfaces are little paths, but they don’t carry the big viral traffic,” he says.",real

No infectious disease in a century has exacted as swift and merciless a toll on the United States as covid-19. With no vaccine and no cure, the pandemic has killed people in every state. The necessary isolation it imposes has robbed the bereaved of proper goodbyes and the comfort of mourning rituals. Those remembered in this continually updating series represent but some of the tens of thousands who have died. Some were well-known, and many were unsung. All added their stories, from all walks of life, to the diversity of the American experience.

“Once she had her mind made up about something, Aunt Edna’s was the only opinion that mattered.”

Edna Adams, 105, a woman of faith and conviction, spent her life defying expectations. She lived through the 1918 flu pandemic, women’s suffrage, the Great Depression and two world wars. After her husband died, she lived alone for more than 40 years, moving into a nursing home after her 100th birthday. She fell ill there in April and died days later, becoming the District of Columbia’s oldest coronavirus victim.

Health authorities in Hubei province, where the coronavirus first was detected in in December, reported 24 deaths and those in Beijing reported the Chinese capital’s first fatality. No national toll was announced, but 81 other deaths had been reported through Monday.

The U.S. Consulate in Wuhan, where authorities cut off most access Jan. 22 in an effort to contain the disease, was preparing to fly its diplomats and some other Americans out of the city. Japan, France and Mongolia and other governments also were preparing evacuations.

China had expanded its already sweeping disease-control efforts by extending the end of this week’s Lunar New Year holiday, the country’s busiest travel season, by three days to Sunday to keep the public at home and reduce the risk infection will spread.

Mongolia closed its vast border with China. Hong Kong and Malaysia announced they were barring entry to visitors from Hubei province. Chinese travel agencies were ordered to cancel group tours nationwide.

U.S. health officials expanded their recommendation for people to avoid non-essential travel to any part of China, rather than just Wuhan and other areas most affected by the outbreak.

On Tuesday, English-proficiency and other tests for students to apply to foreign universities were canceled. Public schools and universities have been ordered to postpone reopening following the Lunar New Year holiday until further notice.

Stock markets around the world were down sharply Monday as investors worried the outbreak could hurt the global economy.

China has confirmed more than 2,700 cases of the new virus, most in Wuhan. More than 40 cases have been confirmed elsewhere in the world. Almost involve Chinese tourists or people who visited Wuhan.

China’s increasingly drastic containment efforts began with the Jan. 22 suspension of plane, train and bus links to Wuhan, a city of 11 million people. That lockdown has expanded to 17 cities with more than 50 million people — the most far-reaching disease-control measures ever imposed.

The epidemic has revived memories of the SARS outbreak that originated in China and killed nearly 800 people. Then, Chinese authorities were criticized for reacting slowly and failing to disclose information. The government has responded more aggressively to the latest outbreak.

Wuhan is building two hospitals, one with 1,500 beds and another with 1,000, for the growing number of patients. The first is scheduled to be finished next week.

The virus is from the coronavirus family that includes the common cold but also more severe illnesses like SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. The new virus causes cold- and flu-like symptoms, including cough and fever, and in more severe cases, shortness of breath and pneumonia.

The virus is thought to have spread to people from wild animals sold at a market in Wuhan. On Sunday, authorities banned trade in wild animals and urged people to stop eating meat from them.",real
133,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/science/coronavirus-drugs-chloroquine.html,2020-03-23,Scientists Identify 69 Drugs to Test Against the Coronavirus,"
Nearly 70 drugs and experimental compounds may be effective in treating the coronavirus, a team of researchers reported on Sunday night.
Some of the medications are already used to treat other diseases, and repurposing them to treat Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, may be faster than trying to invent a new antiviral from scratch, the scientists said.
The list of drug candidates appeared in a study published on the web site bioRxiv. The researchers have submitted the paper to a journal for publication.
To come up with the list, hundreds of researchers embarked on an unusual study of the genes of the coronavirus, also called SARS-CoV-2.
To infect a lung cell, the coronavirus must insert its genes, co-opting the cell’s own genetic machinery. The cell begins to produce viral proteins, which are used to produce millions of new viruses.
Each of those viral proteins must be able to latch onto the necessary human proteins for the process to work.
In the new study, the scientists investigated 26 of the coronavirus’s 29 genes, which direct production of the viral proteins. The researchers found 332 human proteins targeted by the coronavirus.
Some viral proteins seemed to target just one human protein; other viral proteins are capable of targeting a dozen human cellular proteins.
The researchers sought drugs that also latch onto the human proteins that the coronavirus seems to need to enter and replicate in human cells. The team eventually identified 24 drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat such seemingly unrelated diseases as cancer, Parkinson’s disease and hypertension.
On the list were such unexpected candidates as haloperidol, used to treat schizophrenia, and metformin, taken by people with Type 2 diabetes.
The investigators also found candidates among compounds that are now in clinical trials or that are the subject of early research. Intriguingly, some of the possible treatments are drugs used to attack parasites.
And the list includes antibiotics that kill bacteria by gumming up the cellular machinery they use to build proteins. But some of those drugs also attach to human proteins. The new study raises the possibility that this side effect might turn out to be an antiviral treatment.
One drug on the list, chloroquine, kills the single-celled parasite that causes malaria. Scientists have long known that it can also attach to a human cellular protein called the sigma-1 receptor. And that receptor is also the target of the virus.
Chloroquine has been much in the news this past week, thanks to speculation about its use against the coronavirus — some of which was repeated by President Trump at a news briefing at the White House on Friday.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, followed the president’s remarks with a warning that there was only “anecdotal evidence” that chloroquine might work.
Only well-run trials could establish whether chloroquine was safe and effective against the coronavirus, Dr. Fauci said.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization announced it would begin a trial on chloroquine, among other drugs.
And on Sunday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York announced that the state had obtained large amount of chloroquine and the antibiotic azithromycin to start its own drug trial.
Nevan Krogan, a biologist at the University of California, San Francisco, who led the new study, warned that chloroquine might have many toxic side effects, because the drug appears to target many human cellular proteins.
“You need to be careful,” he said. “We need more data at every level.”Dr. Krogan’s collaborators at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York and the Pasteur Institute in Paris have started testing 22 of the other compounds on the list against live coronavirus grown in their laboratories.
On Sunday night, they were still awaiting the first results.",real

A new bill has been introduced into the 116th Congress (2019-2020) of the U.S. House of Representatives named H.R.6666 - COVID-19 Testing, Reaching, And Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act, with the potential to further the loss of the already vanishing health freedoms of each and every citizen of the United States. You can stand with us today by opposing H.R.6666 now (use this link to Take A Stand)

H.R. 6666, despite having been introduced by Rep. Bobby L. Rush [D-IL-1] and referred to the Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on the same day almost two weeks ago on 5/01/2020, has received little mainstream media coverage to this date, other than recent attempts to debunk claims that it would further violate the rights of Americans. As of 5/14/2020 is has 59 co-sponsors, including one Republican, indicating the potential that it may gain greater bipartisan support unless strongly opposed.

H.R. 6666 authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Director of the CDC, to allocate a 100 billion dollars, annually (or until the national COVID emergency is declared over), to employ, train, and deploy an immense workforce of “testing and contact tracers” to be sent directly to everyone’s homes for diagnostic testing and tracing of contacts suspected to have been infected or are at risk of infection with COVID-19. The bill uses broad yet highly vague language to describe the role of this veritable army of new agents of the emerging U.S. medical police state “for other purposes,” such as “support the quarantine of such contacts.”

The nebulous language of H.R. 6666 affords the government and public and private grantees under its coordination unusually broad discretion to apply its newly granted police powers under the presently defined “national COVID health emergency.” Since the national lockdown began on March the 15th, we’ve witnessed the near complete suspension of most of our Constitutionally irrevocable civil liberties, with the near complete cessation and/or modification of all socio-economic activity within the country. Moreover, executive orders have already been enacted throughout this country enabling the forced seizure of body tissue and fluids, property, forced vaccination, testing, isolation, quarantine and arrest without due process. While not all of these draconian regulations have yet been implemented en masse, they exist in the letter of the law and therefore could be enforced, especially given that bills such as H.R.6666 use broad discretionary language leaving it to the government to intepret its meaning and apply force as it sees fit. If H.R. 6666 passes, real ""teeth"" would be put to many of the laws, acts, orders, and regulations that have been passed as executive orders over the past two months, potentially locking the entire country into an irreversible control grid the likes of which we have not seen outside of countries like China.

In light of this, H.R. 6666 may be setting the stage for the implementation of what WHO director Dr. Mike Ryan of the WHO and Ventura County California officials, say will include forcibly removing family members found positive or suspected of being infected. The only way to prevent this is to make sure the bill is opposed and dies.

Eligible recipients of funds include “faith-based” and “school-based” institutions, implying that these organizations might also become, in part, testing or treatment centers.

What is Contract Tracing?

Take a few minutes to watch the important reports by independent journalists Spyro Skouras and James Corbett on the contact tracing agenda in the rapidly unfolding story of coronavirus.

Contract tracing, which on the surface appears to mitigate the risk of disease spread by identifying carriers and interfering their further contact with the healthy, is based on a series of flawed assumptions:

The disease known as COVID-19 and believed to be caused by a singular infectious disease entity, i.e. the viral particle known as SARS-CoV-2, has never been validated through Koch postulates to be inducible and solely caused by SARS-CoV-2 within a controlled clinical or experimental setting. Over 100 different types of coronavirus have already been identified in circulation naturally around the world, and there is serious doubt that we can adequately distinguish between natural extracellular vesicles such as human exosomes and novel or endogenous forms of coronovirus already present in the human virome with the tests being used today, namely, RT-PCR. Learn more about this at www.questioningcovid.com That so-called “positive cases” identified through any number of over 100 different PCR-based and antibody-testing methods are accurate indicators of the presence of COVID-19, or do not generate false positives. If false positives are not accounted for, contract tracing can cause or contribute to a falsely expanding epidemic and those who are unnecessarily quarantined and treated will succumb to greatly elevated iatrogenically induced morbidity and mortality risks, which will never be discovered because the so-called “confirmed case fatality rates for COVID-19” require no viral testing, and only “suspicion of infection.” This is because the WHO and US Vital Statistics agencies explicitly advise against confirming these suspicion-based deaths through viral testing and other clinical means, in an egregious departure from both science and evidence-based medicine.

If contact tracing is fraught with technical inadequacies, why would it be so aggressively implemented nationwide? One reason is that it provides a justification for total spectrum dominance via real-time surveillance and control of the entire population under the auspices of “public health safety,” into perpetuity. In essence, it is like a new “war on terror,” but with the enemy being defined as our own bodies, or contact between bodies, and the solution the complete removal of any privacy, nor right to exempt oneself or children from medical mandates. The system would likely include tracking GPS data of mobile device users and then following back their contacts to identify, test, isolate, quarantine, medicate, or otherwise vaccinate them when one becomes available most likely in the fall of 2020. The media has already fomented profound fear through misreporting, misrepresenting, and catastrophizing case fatality projections, over the past few months. Their egregious disregard for the truth has lead to socioenomic and psychobiological impacts that are arguably orders of magnitude more harmful and deadly than this, or any other virus believed to contribute to flu-like illness. Clearly, the media and power that be could re-manufacture another crisis, or “second” or “third” wave simply be repeating what they have already one (learn more on the topic via the Corbett Report). At which point, with an army of contact tracers, testers, quarantine enforcers, and medicators and vaccinators, the systems being funded by H.R. 6666 would be ready to further this agenda.

So, why does H.R. 6666 refrain from providing even the most rudimentary details to how one of the largest and most widespread in impact bills ever introduced will impact those affected? The more vague and broad the language, the less oversight. The truth is that the detailed plans for how H.R.666 will be implemented were already written and revealed to the public a month ago by the Rockefeller Foundation in a 30-page plan titled, “NATIONAL COVID-19 TESTING ACTION PLAN:Pragmatic steps to reopen our workplaces and our communities.” Not coincidentally, the plan proposed the exact same dollar figure was required - 100 billion dollars -- and suggested that between 100-300,000 contract tracers would be needed.

You’re not alone. Celebrities are cooped up in their homes across the country just like the rest of us. As we collectively navigate this uncharted territory, USA TODAY presents Quarantine Diaries, which give readers a peek into how our favorite stars are spending their time at home.

Today's diarist is ""Dancing With the Stars"" six-time champion Derek Hough, who romped to ""Chim Chim Cher-ee"" with girlfriend and fellow quarantiner Hayley Erbert on Sunday's ""The Disney Family Singalong 2."" (The couple re-created ""Be Our Guest"" for the first singalong last month.) Here's what life is like for multi-threat entertainer Hough, 34, who appears as a judge on NBC's ""World of Dance"" fourth season (returns May 26). – As told to Bryan Alexander

8 a.m. Sometimes we sleep in, but often we get up about 8 with our cat nuzzling our faces. The bed becomes this animal affair with two cats (Lily and Palo) and dog Romie jumps in at about 7. Most of the time, we don't have breakfast. I drink this green shake in the morning, my favorite thing, with super-green powder and vitamins. I mix it with mango-flavored Pre-Workout. It's healthy and gives a little boost.

Staying Apart, Together: Are you breathing correctly? Plus, the healing power of the Olympics

9:00 a.m. The thing I love doing right now that I've never really had time to do, but I obviously have a lot of time now, is gardening. It's springtime, so everything is blooming. I'm outside for a solid hour in the morning, picking weeds, watering the plants, admiring the new growth. There's something very peaceful and nurturing. It's amazing that gardening is my new favorite thing to do in the morning.

11 a.m. We try work out every day, do something physical. Especially right now. motion equals emotion. Whenever I'm not moving, my brain starts going a little busy. We do something outside or in the garage. I just need to move.

On creating televised routines from home: Choreographing with limited home space has definitely required creativity. But it focuses me. Normally you have a camera operator. But it's just Hayley and me. We have to fix the camera, perform, look at it. And it's like we moved out of frame or the angle's not good. Constant trial and error. Fortunately, we've been part of a lot of shows and tours. So a lot of the costumes didn't make it back to wardrobe, they make it back to our closets. Like those chimney sweep outfits or the Belle costume.

I did see my neighbor outside while I was in full Lumiere costume and I was like, ""Don't even ask me about it."" That was hilarious.

On dancing for stress relief: When I'm dancing professionally or to create something, I'm in that zone. When I'm just dancing for fun, it doesn't look good. I kind of dance like a fool, honestly, like that embarrassing uncle at a wedding. But the truth is, moving around freely with no rules is definitely liberating and makes you feel good.

6 p.m. We start making dinner. I don't know my way around the kitchen at all. I'm a sous chef to Hayley. I call it ""Hayl's Kitchen."" She directs, ""Wash this, watch this, peel this."" We like to watch shows like ""The World's Most Extraordinary Homes"" while we cook. I just love architecture. So there's often times we'll be cooking and I'll fall into a daze watching and she'll be like, ""Babe, we need those things."" And I'm like, ""Sorry, sorry."" But it's fun and nice to create something. I clean up afterward. That way, I feel I've done my part.

Dessert treat: We eat healthy all day. But after dinner is when the candy, popcorn, chips and salsa, and Twizzlers come out. Hayley has made her own ice cream, mint chocolate chip. I was like, ""I didn't know we had that machine."" She made something called S'mores Yumminess. It's graham-cracker crust with marshmallow fluff and chocolate, more graham cracker on top. She bakes it, and it's insane. She's surprising me with these skills.

On working through relationships: After six weeks of being with each other 24/7 is when we started to become like, ""OK, we might've reached our limit here."" But it's been really good, actually. If we don't agree on something or get into an argument, it's very short-lived. Because at this moment of time, we're just thankful for our health and for everything. We don't take that for granted. Also, when you're with somebody, it's not like, ""OK, I'm leaving, I'm going to go cool off out here."" It's like, ""OK, we've got to figure this out as fast as possible."" So it's been good.

What I'm streaming: We knocked out ""Tiger King"" pretty quickly. Fascinating and disturbing. We managed to get through ""Ozark,"" all three seasons. We're loving Netflix's ""Queer Eye,"" which is a great transformational show.

11 p.m. I head to bed at night like 11. This is after we'll watch something on the couch. She's out after like 30 seconds, mouth agape out cold. But I'll watch the movie or the show until about 11.

When quarantine ends: We're going to Yosemite or a national park that is just beautiful. Nature is just the ultimate. Right now with the cats, we're seeing straight up ""National Geographic."" When you watch them all day, you see behavior you've never seen before.

Depends on which country you are flying in,"SYDNEY/BEIJING/HELSINKI (Reuters) - In Thailand, you cannot have food or water in flight and must wear a mask. In Malaysia and Indonesia, the plane needs to be half-empty. In the United States and Europe, it’s not mandatory for airlines to leave the middle seat open.

FILE PHOTO - Rows of empty seats of an American Airline flight are seen, as coronavirus disease (COVID-19) disruption continues across the global industry, during a flight between Washington D.C. and Miami, in Washington, U.S., March 18, 2020. REUTERS/Carlos Barria

Measures to stem the spread of coronavirus have changed how people travel, as Beijing resident Feng Xueli, 26, found when she took a domestic flight this month. The aircraft was full - allowed under the Chinese rules.

“We needed to wear a mask during the flight and there were PA announcements basically asking for our cooperation with these anti-virus measures put in place, which made me a bit nervous,” Feng said. “You also need to go through a lot of temperature checks and security checks when you leave the airport.”

Travellers, airlines and airports are grappling with a hodgepodge of rules put in place during the pandemic that will make flying different in almost every country.

“When flying restarts, you are already working against the clock. There is still a latent fear of travel,” said Subhas Menon, head of the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines. “It’s not going to be such a smooth passage when you travel because of all of the measures that are going to be introduced.”

A little more than a year after uneven national responses to the grounding of the Boeing (BA.N) 737 MAX, the industry is once again facing piecemeal regulation.

The last trigger for such widespread changes in the way airlines operate was the 2001 attacks in the United States, which ushered in new security measures.

“People globally have understood the security requirements that came after 9/11. We would like to see that kind of standardisation of protocols,” said Boeing vice-president Mike Delaney, leader of Boeing’s Confident Travel Initiative.

Onboard service is changing too. Business-class meals, once a selling point for premium carriers hiring celebrity chefs, have been reduced to pre-packaged items on carriers including Emirates, Air Canada (AC.TO) and British Airways.

Automation is also increasing, as carriers such as Qantas Airways Ltd (QAN.AX) ask passengers to check in online to limit contact with staff and other fliers.

“More than ever, the industry will work towards the vision of an entirely mobile-enabled journey,” said Sumesh Patel of technology provider SITA, which hopes to benefit from the trend.

EMPTY MIDDLE SEAT?

On the airplane, one of the biggest debates has been over whether middle seats should be empty.

That would limit airplanes to two-thirds of their normal capacity, not enough for most airlines to make a profit without increasing fares.

Afif Zakwan, 20, recently took a Malaysia Airlines domestic flight that was exempt from the requirement to fly half-empty.

He said he was comfortable being on a full domestic flight, but would not consider flying internationally for now.

“As more and more people travel for whatever reason, confidence and the power of word of mouth experiences will shape the... recovery,” said Mayur Patel of data firm OAG Aviation.

An official at the Japan Civil Aviation Bureau said the issue of an open middle seat, which could create unfair advantages if applied unevenly, was “controversial”.

“It’s crucial that countries where flights depart coordinate their responses with countries where they arrive,” said the official, who was not authorised to speak publicly.

Despite the call for common standards, some nations are applying their rules just to airlines registered in their country, while others are applying them to foreign carriers.

U.S. carriers are among those requiring passengers and crew to wear facial coverings, and have also endorsed temperature checks.

In Europe, airlines are largely resisting calls to leave the middle seat empty but have publicised other changes designed to reassure passengers.

“You have to remember an aircraft is not the natural place to do social-distancing, so you need to mitigate the health risks by other means, and facial masks are a good example of those means,” Finnair Plc (FIA1S.HE) Chief Executive Topi Manner told Reuters.",real
89,https://www.worldhealth.net/news/common-drugs-may-confer-higher-risk-covid-19/,2020-03-17,Common Drugs That May Confer Higher Risk For COVID-19,"It is known [1] that coronaviruses bind to target cells via angiotensin converting enzyme 2. COVID-19 attaches and binds to target cells through ACE2 protein sites on cells of the lung, intestine, kidneys and blood vessels.

Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 sites are increased [2] by Ibuprofen, antihypertensive medications such as ACE inhibitors, ARBS, Thiazolidedinones, as well as type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

The most frequent comorbidities include diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and cerebrovascular diseases that have been reported thus far in those with COVID-19, and these are typically treated with ACE inhibitors, although this was not mentioned in the studies.

The higher level of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 may increase infection with COVID-19 and consequently may also increase the risks for both severe and fatal infection of the COVID-19 virus. However, antihypertensive calcium channel blockers [3] don’t increase ACE2, and should be taken into consideration as a possible alternative drug and may be worth having a conversation with your prescribing physician about.

Examples of angiotensin converting enzyme ACE inhibitors include:

Captopril (Capoten),

Enalapril (Vasotec),

Fosinopril (Monopril),

Lisinopril (Prinivil, Zestril),

Moexipril (Univasc)

Perindopril (Aceon),

Quinapril (Accupril),

Ramipril (Altace),

Trandolapril (Mavik),

Benazepril (Lotensin, Lotensin Hct).

Examples of (ARBs) angiotensin II receptor blockers include:

Azilsartan (Edarbi)

Candesartan (Atacand)

Eprosartan

Irbesartan (Avapro)

Losartan (Cozaar)

Olmesartan (Benicar)

Telmisartan (Micardis)

Valsartan (Diovan)

Examples of Thiazolidnediones include:

Rosiglitazone (Avandia)

Pioglitazone (Actos)

Examples of calcium channel blockers include:

Norvasc (amlodipine)

The project, led by Neil Johnson, professor of physics at George Washington University, who also heads a new initiative in Complexity and Data Science, analyzed Facebook communities containing close to 100 million individuals. The study grouped them into color-coded “clusters” to chart how members interact, shift, and share links, and illustrates how differing stances on vaccination have evolved and competed over time.

For the study, investigators developed an innovative tool to map vaccine conversations among 100 million Facebook users during the height of the 2019 measles outbreak. Johnson noted:

“There is a new world war online surrounding trust in health expertise and science, particularly with misinformation about COVID-19, but also distrust in big pharmaceuticals and governments. Nobody knew what the field of battle looked like, though, so we set to find out.”1

RELATED STORY:

While vaccine supporters (coded “Blue”) outnumber users with anti-vaccine views (coded “Red”) on Facebook, the platform has nearly three times as many anti-vaccination communities. According to the study, that makes it far more likely that their views will reach undecided people (coded “Green”).

RELATED STORY:

Researchers also found that pro-vaccine communities may be putting their focus in the wrong place. Researchers suggested that those concentrating on larger anti-vaccination communities might miss chances to influence medium-sized communities that are growing under the radar.

The study also noted that anti-vaccination groups offer lots of content about vaccines and other proven health treatments, such as safety concerns, conspiracy theories, or individual choice. With about 3 billion people using the social media platform, this content increases their chance of influencing Facebook users who are undecided.

Pro-vaccination communities typically focused their messages on the public health benefits of vaccination, according to the study. In a university press release, Johnson said:

“We thought we would see major public health entities and state-run health departments at the center of this online battle, but we found the opposite. They were fighting off to one side, in the wrong place.” “Instead of playing whack-a-mole with a global network of communities that consume and produce [mis]information, public health agencies, social media platforms and governments can use a map like ours and an entirely new set of strategies to identify where the largest theaters of online activity are and engage and neutralize those communities peddling in misinformation so harmful to the public.”1

RELATED STORY:

Under present conditions, one predictive model used by the scientists observed that anti-vaccination support could reach dominance in approximately ten years. Johnson said:

“This is now a war over hearts and minds. The growing success of Red lies in the fact that Red now offers lots of attractive ‘flavors’ of health-related narrative, such as questioning role of big pharma, government, civil liberties, freedom of choice for their kids etc. By contrast, Blue is like vanilla, one flavor of message.”1

Johnson has continued to monitor the trends during the ongoing novel coronavirus outbreak, and says targeting undecided individuals is critical. Referencing the cluster color coding, he explained:

“With COVID-19, this is a perfect storm since Blue itself is not 100 percent sure about the science. Since the start of COVID-19, we already see Green communities in this picture turning Red. “The implication is that instead of trying to convince Red, which is very hard and may backfire to make them stronger, Blue should focus on intelligently engaging Green. Like in an insurgency, the battle should be for hearts and minds. Greens are much larger numerically in total, and could tip the balance away from herd immunity if not enough Greens get vaccinated against COVID-19, when a vaccine appears. “Though the focus is on vaccines and COVID-19, the same applies for other scientific distrust, including climate change. Don’t fight the Reds, engage the Greens.”1

Slate is making its essential coronavirus coverage free for all readers. Subscribe to support our journalism. Start your free trial.

Mr. X had been on a ventilator for more than three weeks when he died for the first time, the second time, the third time, and the fourth and final time. Each time he died, his heart stopped beating. Each time we performed chest compressions, gave him eleventh-hour medications, and resuscitated him, until the final time. None of it would have happened if Mr. X had not been infected with SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.

While Mr. X was my patient for only a few days, the truth is that there have been tens of thousands like him across the United States over the past three months, men and women who have died of the coronavirus—more than 85,000 as of this writing. Despite our communal response to COVID-19, I fear there may still be tens of thousands yet to come if not more. For that reason, it is important the story of Mr. X and his death be told. He was a unique person with a singular life, but in terms of dying from the coronavirus, he could have been you, me, or anyone.

He was not a young man, but he was not especially old either. He was in his 70s, the same age as my parents. He had an irregular heart beat for which he took blood thinners and an immune condition for which he took a low dose of daily steroid. Like 1 in 10 of the U.S. population, he had diabetes. Long ago he suffered a mild stroke.

Upon his death, he had already been treated in the ICU with antibiotics for bacterial pneumonia three times. A few days earlier, he had a heart attack on account of the stresses critical illness was placing on his body. This was despite already being on high-dose steroids to boost his insufficient adrenal glands in coping with that stress.

When he came into the emergency department three weeks earlier, he had only been sick for less than a day with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and a cough. Six hours later he was gasping for air, intubated with a tube down his throat, and put on a breathing machine like nearly 11 percent of people with COVID-19 in hospitals. Tragically roughly half those intubated people end up dying of acute respiratory distress syndrome, lungs that are so critically damaged by COVID-19 that they cease being able to deliver oxygen into the blood. This was the fate of Mr. X.

For days after his admission into the hospital, Mr. X was also in septic shock. His blood pressure was dangerously low and supported with medication delivered through an intravenous tube placed into the jugular vein in the right side of his neck. Its tip ended in the big vein that fed the right side of his heart, allowing for medication to instantaneously mix into the blood.

Despite all this, there were moments of hope. At some point, Mr. X no longer required medication to maintain his blood pressure. The level of oxygen needed through his breathing tube decreased. His support was weaned. But in this lull, multiple tests of whether Mr. X had the strength to come off his ventilator ended in failure, with hope always lying in trying again the next day.

But after steadily improving over weeks, he quickly began to worsen over a single day. The first time his heart stopped was at noon that day. His blood pressure plummeted, and his heart rate dropped. Everyone in the ICU was at the ready when his pulse disappeared and CPR was started. Six minutes and two doses of epinephrine later, his pulse returned. He was alive again.

Forty minute later, Mr. X died a second time. A “CODE BLUE” was announced over the hospital speakers. Three minutes later, there was a pulse. An emergency ultrasound showed strain in his right heart indirectly pointing toward a massive blood clot in the lungs despite his blood thinner; he received an urgent clot-busting infusion twice.

Then, 20 minutes later, his pulse disappeared a third time as Mr. X’s heart went into ventricular fibrillation, a twitchy, shockable rhythm. In five minutes, he received two shocks at 200 joules each and his pulse returned. But the situation was dire with blood tests showing such profound abnormalities that we all knew we were no longer extending Mr. X’s life insomuch as prolonging his death.

We spoke to his family throughout Mr. X’s ordeal. We all agreed not to start compressions if his heart stopped a fourth time. In three weeks, they were never able to visit him in the hospital. But as his medical team, we called them every day with updates.

Mr. X died an hour after we decided not to start compressions again, at 3:38 p.m. A nurse held his left hand while a doctor held his right hand as his heartbeat gradually slowed before it disappeared forever. His family received their last phone call from the doctor with the sadly expected news.

Mr. X died after being infected with SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. The story of his death is his, but I worry there will be many more to come, with stories that start to feel familiar.

Over 4.9 million people across the globe have been diagnosed with COVID-19, the disease caused by the new respiratory virus, according to data compiled by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. The actual numbers are believed to be much higher due to testing shortages, many unreported cases and suspicions that some governments are hiding the scope of their nations' outbreaks.

Since the first cases were detected in China in December, the United States has become the worst-affected country, with more than 1.5 million diagnosed cases and at least 92,645 deaths.

""Disturbingly, we have open lanes of traffic and an apparent open season on reckless driving,"" said Lorraine Martin, president and CEO of the National Safety Council.

""Right now, in the midst of a global pandemic and crisis, we should take it as our civic duty to drive safely,"" Martin said. ""If we won't do it for ourselves, we should do it for our first responders, our law enforcement and our healthcare workers, who are rightly focused on coronavirus patients and should not be overwhelmed by preventable car crashes.""

10:35 a.m.: NYC offering testing to all of its 169 nursing homes

New York City is expanding testing to reach residents at all of the city's 169 nursing homes, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Wednesday.

Seniors are especially vulnerable to the virus and U.S. nursing homes have experienced outbreaks.

Starting next week, New York City will offer on-site tests in all nursing homes and will ""continue as long as it takes,"" de Blasio said.

The city is expected to run 3,000 tests per day through a city-contracted lab, he said.

Mandatory staff testing has begun, the mayor said, and any staff member who tests positive will be required to stay out of work for 14 days. New York City's surge staffing has already added 240 personnel and will fulfill all staffing requests by the end of next week, de Blasio said.

De Blasio said 10 outbreak response teams are ready to jump into action if an outbreak hits a nursing home or senior center. Each team has an epidemiologist and experts in infection control, mental health and social work, he said.

Part of the recovery planning will also include looking at the way to maximize home-based care, rather than nursing home care, the mayor said.

De Blasio on Wednesday also called attention to the ""troubling"" decline in vaccination rates during the pandemic.

With families staying home and fewer doctors' offices open, the number of administered vaccine doses are down 63%, de Blasio said.

Vaccinations are down 91% for those older than 2 years, and down 42% for those younger than 2.

Over a six-week period in 2019, almost 400,000 doses were administered in the city, compared to fewer than 150,000 doses over the same six weeks in 2020, he said.

""Something has to be done immediately,"" the mayor stressed, calling vaccinations ""essential work"" and ""a reason to leave your home.""

Vaccines are being offered for free at over 1,000 facilities in the city. The mayor urged parents to call their pediatrician to make an appointment.

When it came to New York City's three tracking progress indicators, de Blasio called it ""not perfect, but a good day.""

There were 63 people admitted to New York City hospitals for suspected COVID-19 on Monday, up from 57 admissions on Sunday.

But there were 483 patients in city ICUs on Monday, down from 492 patients on Sunday.

And of those tested citywide on Monday, 8% were positive, down from 9% one day earlier.

9:19 a.m.: Wuhan nearly doubles number of COVID-19 tests per day

The Chinese city of Wuhan, ground zero of the coronavirus pandemic, conducted 856,128 nucleic acid tests on Tuesday, nearly doubling the previous day, according to the local health authority.

No confirmed cases of COVID-19 with symptoms were found during Tuesday's testing period; however, 13 new asymptomatic carriers were identified, according to daily reports published by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission.

Last week, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission announced a citywide campaign to test the entire population of 11 million residents for COVID-19 in an effort to search for asymptomatic carriers of the virus, after a cluster of new cases emerged for the first time since the city had lifted its strict lockdown on April 8. The number of nucleic acid tests conducted in the city daily has rapidly increased since then.

Although recommended, participation in the testing campaign is voluntary. Residents who were previously tested do not need to take part. It is not recommended to test children under the age of 6, according to the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission's website.

8:29 a.m.: Students start returning to classrooms across South Korea

South Korean schools began welcoming back students on Wednesday for the first time since the start of the coronavirus pandemic.

Hundreds of thousands of high school seniors in South Korea were allowed to return to their schools Wednesday morning, while students in lower grades are expected to go back in phased steps in the coming weeks. Both students and teachers much have their temperatures taken before entering schools and wear face masks in classrooms.

Some 5.4 million students in South Korea have been taking classes online prior to Wednesday's reopening of schools.

South Korea once had the largest novel coronavirus outbreak outside China, where the virus first emerged, but appears to have brought it under control with an extensive ""trace, test and treat"" strategy. A total of 11,110 people in the country have been diagnosed with COVID-19, of which 10,066 have recovered and 263 have died, according to South Korea's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

After relaxing its social-distancing restrictions earlier this month, South Korea saw a small yet sharp spike in new infections linked to reopened nightclubs in the capital, Seoul.

7:43 a.m.: Dutch officials say mink may have infected human with COVID-19

Dutch investigators believe a human may have contracted the novel coronavirus from a mink at a farm in the Netherlands.

New research findings in the ongoing investigation into the country's mink farms also show that the animals can have COVID-19 without showing any symptoms, according to a press release from the Dutch government.

Investigators also believe cats may have a role in the spread of the virus on the mink farms. Coronavirus antibodies were detected in three out of 11 cats at one of the mink farms under investigation. Pending further research, the Dutch government is advising mink farm owners to ensure that cats cannot enter or exit the site.

The government is now instituting mandatory antibody testing of minks at all farms in the Netherlands. The European country is one of the world's largest producers of mink fur.

""These new findings have a major impact on mink farm owners and staff and their families, as well as on local communities,"" Dutch Agriculture Minister Carola Schouten said in a statement late Tuesday night. ""I'm in close contact with all those involved.""

7:08 a.m.: Russia surpasses 300,000 total cases of COVID-19

Russia on Wednesday reported 8,764 new cases of COVID-19 over the past 24 hours, bringing the total to 308,705, according to the country's coronavirus response headquarters.

There were also a record 135 coronavirus-linked fatalities registered over the same period -- the country's highest single-day increase so far -- which places the nationwide death toll at 2,972. The previous record was 119 deaths reported on May 16.

For the first time on Wednesday, Russia's coronavirus response headquarters reported more patients recovering from COVID-19 in the last 24 hours -- 9,262 -- than the number of people testing positive.

Russia has one of the world's highest nationwide tallies of diagnosed cases in the coronavirus pandemic, second only to the United States, according to a count kept by Johns Hopkins University.

Russia's latest daily caseload is down from a peak of 11,656 new infections reported on May 11. Last Thursday marked the end of a 12-day streak during which the country registered over 10,000 new cases per day.

6:24 a.m.: UN chief warns coronavirus pandemic threatens Africa's progress

The United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned Wednesday that the coronavirus pandemic threatens Africa's progress, although the vast continent seems to be relatively spared from the scourge of the virus so far.

There have been less than 3,000 deaths from COVID-19 out of some 88,000 cases of the disease reported throughout Africa. That could be, in part, due to the fact that many countries across the continent took swift action in imposing preventative measures to stem the spread of the virus.

""As of now, reported cases are lower than feared,"" Guterres said in a video message Wednesday, while warning that ""much hangs in the balance"" and the pandemic ""will aggravate long-standing inequalities and heighten hunger, malnutrition and vulnerability to disease.""

The U.N. chief called for ""international action to strengthen Africa's health systems, maintain food supplies, avoid a financial crisis, support education, protect jobs, keep households and businesses afloat, and cushion the continent against lost income and export earnings."" He said the continent needs more than $200 billion and ""an across-the-board debt standstill for African countries"" to help address the devastating economic and social fallout of the crisis.

""Already, demand for Africa's commodities, tourism and remittances are declining,"" Guterres said, adding that ""the opening of the trade zone has been pushed back.""

5:41 a.m.: University of Cambridge to keep all lectures online until summer 2021

The prestigious University of Cambridge plans to keep all lectures online over the course of the next academic year due to the coronavirus pandemic.

""The University is constantly adapting to changing advice as it emerges during this pandemic,"" a spokesperson told ABC News in a statement Wednesday. ""Given that it is likely that social distancing will continue to be required, the University has decided there will be no face-to-face lectures during the next academic year.""

It's the first globally-known university to announce such plans beyond the upcoming fall term.

""Lectures will continue to be made available online and it may be possible to host smaller teaching groups in person, as long as this conforms to social distancing requirements,"" the spokesperson added. ""This decision has been taken now to facilitate planning, but as ever, will be reviewed should there be changes to official advice on coronavirus.""

The University of Cambridge, one of the oldest universities in the world, closed its campuses in the United Kingdom in March due to the pandemic. All teaching has been moved online and exams are conducted virtually.

4:19 a.m.: All 50 US states have now eased coronavirus restrictions

All 50 U.S. states have now taken steps to ease restrictions put in place to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus.

Connecticut was among the last to begin reopening its society and economy, with residents allowed to go to retail shops and dine outdoors at restaurants starting Wednesday. Hair salons and barbershops, however, won't be allowed to reopen until June 1, while guidance on gyms, nail salons, massage therapy businesses and tattoo parlors will come at a later date.

Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont called it a ""slow and methodical reopening.""

""There is a balance and there's nothing that is risk-free,"" Lamont said at a virtual press conference Tuesday. ""I think we can proceed on a very thoughtful basis with those businesses that are least likely to be dangerous and most likely to have a real economic value for the state. And I'm looking forward, I think this is a good day for the state and I hope everybody maintains their discipline because that's going to make it successful.""

The process hasn't been without controversy. Earlier this month, protesters gathered outside the Connecticut state capital and the governor's mansion in Hartford demanding that businesses be allowed to resume activities, as a growing number of other states across the country began reopening.

Connecticut, home to some 3.5 million people, has so far tested more than 185,000 people for COVID-19 and at least 38,430 have returned positive results.

At least 3,472 people in the state have died from the disease, while another 914 remained hospitalized Tuesday.

""These are trend lines that I think give us some confidence,"" Lamont said. ""The timing is right, and we hit the key metrics that we thought we would.""

861,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/twitter-misinformation-disputed-tweets-claims-coronavirus/,2020-05-13,Twitter to label misinformation about coronavirus amid flood of false claims and conspiracy theories,"Twitter announced Monday that it will start alerting users when a tweet makes disputed or misleading claims about the coronavirus.

The new rule is the latest in a wave of stricter policies that tech companies are rolling out to confront an outbreak of virus-related misinformation on their sites. Facebook and Google, which owns YouTube, have already put similar systems in place.

The announcement signals that Twitter is taking its role in amplifying misinformation more seriously. But how the platform enforces its new policy will be the real test, with company leaders already tamping down expectations.

Yoel Roth, Twitter's head of site integrity, acknowledged as much: ""We will not be able to take enforcement action on every tweet with incomplete or disputed information about COVID-19.""

Roth said Monday the platform has historically applied a ""lighter touch"" when enforcing similar policies on misleading tweets but said the company is working to improve the technology around the labels.

An example of how Twitter will alert users to tweets that spread misinformation about the coronavirus pandemic. Twitter

In February, Twitter said it would add warning labels to doctored or manipulated photos and videos after a recording of Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was slowed down to make it appear as though she slurred her words. But even with obviously fake videos, such as one showing Joe Biden lolling his tongue and grinning that was shared by President Donald Trump, the company has since used the label only twice, in part because of technical glitches.

And Twitter has not added any warning labels to politicians' tweets that violate its policies but are deemed in the ""public interest"" under a policy the company announced in June 2019.

Under the newest COVID-19 rules, Twitter will decide which tweets are labeled — only taking down posts if they are harmful.

Politicians' tweets will be subject to the notices, which will be available in roughly 40 languages.

Some of the questionable tweets will run with a label underneath that directs users to a link with additional information about COVID-19. Other tweets might be covered entirely by a warning label alerting users that ""some or all of the content shared in this tweet conflict with guidance from public health experts regarding COVID-19.""

Twitter won't directly fact check or call tweets false on the site, said Nick Pickles, the company's global senior strategist for public policy. The warning labels might send users to curated tweets, public health websites or news articles.

""People don't want us to play the role of deciding for them what's true and what's not true but they do want people to play a much stronger role providing context,"" Pickles said.

The notices, which could start appearing as soon as today, could also apply retroactively to past tweets.

The fine line is similar to one taken by tech rival Facebook, which has said it doesn't want to be an ""arbiter of the truth"" but has arranged for third-party fact checkers to review falsehoods on its site. The Associated Press is part of Facebook's fact-checking program.

One example of a disputed tweet that might be labeled on its site includes claims about the origin of COVID-19, which remains unknown. Conspiracy theories about how the virus started and if it is man-made have swirled around social media for months.

The War on Science

Twitter will continue to take down COVID-19 tweets that pose a threat to the safety of a person or group, along with attempts to incite mass violence or widespread civil unrest. The company has been removing bogus coronavirus cures and claims that social distancing or face masks do not curb the virus' spread for several weeks.",real

A leaked Pentagon draft memo says that the US should expect for the coronavirus pandemic to last until the summer of 2021, according to those that have seen it.

The Department of Defence document, obtained by Task & Purpose, advises the that the military prepare for a “globally-persistent” Covid-19 environment with no effective vaccine until “at least the summer of 2021.

Authored by Secretary of Defence Mark Esper, though not finalised or signed by him, the memo warns against any complacency that the virus will now be easily defeated: “We have a long path ahead, with the real possibility of a resurgence of Covid-19.”

It continues: “Therefore we must now refocus our attention on resuming critical missions, increasing levels of activity, and making necessary preparations should a significant resurgence of Covid-19 occur later this year.”

These preparations are likely to include the repositioning of forces and supplies in a faster-paced summer move cycle in which personnel are redeployed domestically and internationally.

Task & Purpose reports that the memo was prepared by Kenneth Rapuano, assistant secretary of defence for homeland defence and global security. It is intended as an update to a 1 April guidance document issued by Mr Esper.

A Pentagon spokesperson said that the new document is outdated. Indeed, since early May it had been circulated among the various branches of the military for feedback, a source told Task & Purpose. It is unclear if Mr Esper has yet seen the document.

Pentagon sources confirmed to The Hill that there are versions of plans with similar language to the leaked memo, but none have been approved. Senior officials are also discussing plans to continue with the summer 2020 move cycle — also not yet finalised.

“All indications suggest we will be operating in a globally-persistent Covid-19 environment in the months ahead,” the memo reads. “This will likely continue until there is wide-scale immunity, through immunisation, and some immunity post-recovery from the virus.”

As well as predicting no viable treatment or vaccine until next summer at the earliest, the scenario laid out by the Pentagon assumes successive waves of infection in clusters tied to seasonal flu outbreaks; continued shortages of personal protective equipment; and testing not being able to completely assure an absence of the virus, and therefore requiring extensive contact tracing and monitoring.

As recently as Friday, Mr Esper said that the Pentagon would “deliver by the end of this year a vaccine at scale to treat the American people and our partners abroad.”

A spokesperson later clarified that the end of the year was “a goal”, and experts believe that even if everything were to go perfectly, a 12 to 18-month timeline for a widespread rollout of a vaccine would be optimistic.

For many people around the world, everyday life—working, shopping, exercise, entertainment, even connecting with loved ones—now takes place on a screen. Some of the activities that have gone virtual would have seemed unimaginable just a few months ago, like attending funerals and graduation ceremonies, teaching elementary school, hosting television shows, and, recently, pretending to be ants.

Since early March, a private Facebook group titled simply “A group where we all pretend to be ants in an ant colony” has attracted more than 1.8 million members. The premise is as bizarre as it is self-explanatory: People join the group and act like ants. That’s it. That’s the whole idea. Originally founded in June 2019, the group had a modest following until social distancing rules went into effect earlier this year, sending the numbers skyrocketing. Once accepted by the moderators, users role-play as ants in a variety of ways, posting from the imagined perspective of members of a vast and collaborative colony. Most of those posts consist of images of food with captions like “help me bring this to The Queen!” to which other users comment “LIFT” or “HELP.” Others include calls for assistance in “TUNNEL #75642” and announcements that “someone just peed on my whole family.”

For a scientific perspective on this strange and strangely wholesome corner of the internet, Slate spoke to Allison Cohen, a biologist and researcher at the University of California, San Francisco—and a member of the virtual ant colony herself. This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.

Slate: How did you first hear about the Facebook group?

Allison Cohen: I want to say it was a week into quarantine. The lab had recently closed, and, like most people, I was at home talking to all of my colleagues on the internet. Our watercooler conversation had all gone digital, and we’d been sending a lot of memes and jokes to one another on Slack. One day, one of my lab mates slacked me a link to this Facebook group, and that was when it all started.

Why did you join?

Well, at first I was very confused. But I was quite curious, so I applied, and, once the moderators let me in, it turned out to be surprisingly wholesome and fascinating and fun and low-risk. I usually stay off of Facebook, honestly. I don’t post a whole lot. I’m a little bit afraid of the internet. Maybe you can relate to that, as a reporter. The nice thing is that you’re anonymous because you’re in this … colony … right? So whatever comment you make on anything, nobody can really jump on you personally.

What kind of research do you do?

I am a biologist, but I study mostly fungus. The lab I work in studies a particular kind of fungal infection, a fungus you can inhale that can make you sick. Our labs have been shut down for a little while now, and I recently started volunteering to test COVID samples.

How does the group’s role-play compare to what you know about actual ant behavior? Is it similar at all?

I don’t know a ton about ants, but my understanding is that they do communicate with one another to make collective decisions. This kind of insect behavior is a really cool area of biology right now. There are actually some great ant science articles on the group page that link to studies about the division of labor within colonies between forager ants and soldier ants. So I guess in that way it’s similar.

How do you participate in the group?

I’m mostly just a viewer and an occasional commenter. I haven’t posted anything. I also think, as it has gotten bigger, some bad behavior has begun to crop up. The world has started seeping in. The moderators are trying to control it, but it has gotten a little too big, I think. It’s out of hand. I have begun to see posts about coronavirus and Trump, which is against the rules technically, and it’s also just a bummer. That’s just not something I want to deal with right now.

“I’m really just here for the ants.” — Allison Cohen

How often would you say you check the group?

It has kinda taken up my Facebook feed. There are hundreds of posts every day, and each one gets thousands of comments and likes and responses, so I’m sort of flooded by it. I probably look at it—and this is a hard thing to admit—at least once or twice a day.

What are the most memorable things you have seen on the page?

I have been really into the scientific articles. There was one where researchers were tracking the movement of ants in a colony, and they found that there is one subset of ants that doesn’t seem to be working all that much, and then another subset of ants that seems to be working a lot. So there was a pretty funny thread about that, with people really railing on the lazy ants.

Also, as a mycologist, I’ve always been really fascinated by the Cordyceps fungus, also known as the “zombie fungus,” which infects ants and changes their behavior in a way that favors the fungus. There are direct parallels here to infectious diseases in mammals. For example, the rabies virus is able to completely change the behavior of its hosts to favor transfer of virus in saliva, the parasite Toxoplasma seems to make mice less afraid of predators, and I’ve been seeing a lot of work lately suggesting that the microbes living in our gut can change our behavior. Scientists are only beginning to understand these phenomena. Also, the behavioral infection control practices of ants are really sophisticated, and it’s hard not to draw parallels between those behaviors and what we’re trying to do to stop the spread of COVID-19.

I know explicitly mentioning politics and COVID-19 is against the rules of the group, but do you feel like allusions to the real human world are present?

Oh, God, yes. Despite the rules, it still is pretty explicit. There have been some “essential worker” comments that have cropped up. And some references to communism, which, if you had to pick a political system for ants, it would probably be some sort of communist dictatorship.

Are you into the political stuff, or would you prefer it to be … just ants?

I would prefer just ants. I’m really just here for the ants. Though I will say I enjoy making puns every once in a while, which I guess qualifies as a human activity. There are a lot of ant puns. I just don’t like it when it gets too serious.

What’s an example of an ant pun?

Ulysses S. GrANT. ObamANT. ANTmanuel Macron.

Why do you think the group has become so popular?

Well, I can’t speak to anyone else’s reason for being there, but for me it’s kind of a release. It’s a break from all the serious and upsetting conversations taking place on the internet, on Facebook and other places. Especially right now. For me it is pure escapism.

I can understand that. But … why ants?

I have no idea. I mean, ants are really cool. Plus, ants are accessible. They’re everywhere. As a scientist, I have always been into ants. And I think the weird experiment in collective action is really interesting right now. Also, the group has really developed its own little culture now. It has also developed this whole weird linguistic style. Everyone writes in all-caps and with spaces between the letters, which is something I haven’t seen anywhere else on the internet. I’m guessing it is sort of a founder effect. Like, the first couple members started doing that, and then it caught on. Seeing how this little microcosm develops and changes is, to me, sort of endlessly fascinating.

While it’s clear that the group is a joke and many of the posts are quite funny, it seems to be more than that, too. For the most part, the people engaging with it are very earnest and committed to maintaining the game.

Yeah, I think everyone is just really burnt out on bad news right now. And burnt out on news in general. The internet and social media can be so manipulative. I think people, especially people of younger generations, are so used to everything on the internet having some agenda or marketing campaign or political fuel behind it. We are used to the toxicity and the fighting. And so what is so great and refreshing about this group is that it’s just simple and pure. It’s just ants.",real

A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump’s measures of success. But after a manic 3½ years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.

By far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. “I’m not going to play that game,” said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. “I think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they’re not uniform across states and across countries.”

But even beyond the death count, there’s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. “I’m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,” the official said.

Some Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn’t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn’t been able to focus on getting the response right.

Trump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. “So it is a war and I define victory when it’s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,” he said on May 1. “It can never be a total victory because too many people have died.”

When American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn’t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush’s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.

Others are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. “Allowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,” argued one Republican close to the president.

“The closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.” Sen. Lindsey Graham

But, he added, “If things don’t look like they’re bouncing back by September, I think that’s going to be a problem.”

The fear that Trump can’t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.

When asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump’s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the “economic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.”

A spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.

Others are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)",real

There are simple and straightforward methods to blunt the coronavirus effects on America, given what we know about the spread of this virus, specific actions need to be implemented immediately. The facts are that the virus cannot spread without it getting access to a victim's mucus membranes via eyes, ears, and nose.

Staff on airplanes and other public transport in high-risk situations of coming into contact with those who are infected, should be issued simple reusable masks and gloves made from an ion infused copper cotton material that is anti-viral on contact. The cotton should be infused with copper ions which kill viruses on contact, and thus wearing a copper infused cotton mask with or without an N95 or N99 filters are a superior protection choice.

Prevention of mucus membrane exposure through contact with the hands or through inhalation along with use of tight fitting glasses will protect against cough droplets in the air, this is protection that can be manufactured inexpensively. Issuing colloidal silver in spray bottles to wash eyes will also greatly reduce risk of infection. A colloidal silver solution at 100 ppm is non irritating and universally viracidal as well as only costing a few cents per gallon to the manufacturer.

Technology now exists using nanotech vibrational tuning rods to detect the most infinitesimal amount of a discrete virus in solution. This technology is accurate to picogram scale. Originally developed in Germany, this technology has been commercialized and is being used for the detection of minute toxins in environmental materials. The same technology could be implemented for a very quick and inexpensive test for the virus, which would be much faster, cheaper and more accurate than the PCR technology currently being used. This would allow for instant screening of large numbers of people in rapid fashion at airports and other transportation ports as well as in the hospital and healthcare environments.

In the past HEPA air filters were in common use because the airlines knew that the air in the cabins was recirculating previously breathed air and could increase the risk of spreading airborne infection. Unfortunately today they do not use these advanced filtration systems, as that raised the modest cost to the airlines per flight, and to save this small amount of money they discontinued use of these air filters. Additionally, the airlines insist on flying with the air vents closed in order to again save on the costs of a small amount of jet fuel being used in heating the air for the cockpit and the cabin. It would be a simple solution to install HEPA filters again in the air filtration systems. Airliners and cruise ships should also open the air vents to allow for less cross-contamination and rebreathing of stale air.

A further solution would be the use of commercially available ozone generating machines between flights and airline cabins to detox and disinfect the cabin air and surfaces. A blast of ozone is a superb disinfectant and could easily cleanse an airline cabin in 20 to 30 minutes; the same technology would be effective for cruise ships and trains as well.

There are thousands of natural drugs, herbals, chemicals, plants and physical substances that have viral inhibiting and viral destructive capacity. A single lab could be used to test out these many products for the potential of a safe nontoxic answer to the coronavirus infection. A single lab with automated viral culture mass screening could quickly show which of the thousands of chemicals, drugs and other products of nature will stop this virus.

Finally quarantine at home does not work and will not work as this virus has a long wait and see incubation period. It is also near impossible to keep people completely isolated. The answer is neighborhood isolation trailers that could be constructed quickly and easily, these could be delivered to a specific location where people in quarantine could be housed in near where they live. These isolation homes where the air would be filtered and the sewage would be kept in special isolated disinfected septic tanks, would allow for families to visit via large windows without risking contamination and delivery of food to their relatives via a two-way isolation door system. This would be a more humane and effective means of maintaining strict isolation, while maintaining people in their own community and not overwhelming hospitals with the burden of highly infectious diseased individuals.

Patients on homecare with oxygen and BiPAP positive pressure airway therapy, would be on constant monitoring via telemedicine and Internet cameras, as well as medical telemetry to monitor their respiratory rate as well as their SA02 oxygen saturation, along with EKG, heart rate and their blood pressure. This monitoring could be accomplished via computer systems so that it was automated, again taking the strain and the stress away from the overburdened healthcare community.

Should a patient’s condition begin faltering, a team of highly trained intensive care technicians in full hazmat isolation gear could be dispatched to the patient’s location in a matter of minutes, or just to ensure that a patient on homecare was receiving good care. This system may be even better than patient care in the hospital and would allow for patients who were deteriorating on homecare, to be rapidly transferred to hospital based respiratory intensive care units.

Realize these technologies are off the shelf and are available at this very moment. The only question is the actual implementation of the system of remote controlled advanced high-tech medical care. This program could be in working status in a matter of days, and the cost savings would be immeasurable... the savings of lives.... would be even greater. All this with the added benefit of patients being able to isolate themselves at home in familiar environments, with the support of their already exposed family members.

Utilizing an advanced use of CPAP, as well as remote teams of respiratory intensive care technicians, virtual reality tele-medicine, health monitoring telemetry, positive pressure oxygen therapy, and airway support could be an absolute game changer never seen before in the annals of healthcare.

We owe the American people the best that we can provide.

This worldwide pandemic is a manageable problem that need not lead to mass disruption or mass deaths. There is certainly a drug or many drugs that can inhibit this virus and prevent it’s furthered deadly outcome. The simplest of which are measures to protect your mucous membranes and to protect your hands from becoming germ transmitters.

The American public deserves a better, more intelligent and more humane public health response from its Government. The above measures would give that to them at minimum cost and could be implemented in the matter of days, with no barriers stopping effective public health responses to this contagion impending threat to our nation.

God bless America and God bless its leaders who take appropriate action to protect its citizens.

History will record your actions accurately.",fake

Boris Johnson's government closed down the hospitality industry as part of the coronavirus lockdown.

The closure of fish and chip shops has put chipping potato farmers in a nightmare situation.

In a best-case scenario, there are expected to be 95,000 tonnes of surplus chipping potatoes in July.

Farmers are struggling to work out what to do with them, with limited options available.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Britain's farmers are struggling to work out what to do with tens of thousands of tonnes of spare potatoes when their season ends this summer after the closure of fish and chip shops during the lockdown triggered a collapse in demand.

The UK government's decision in March to close large parts of the economy to contain the spread of the coronavirus halted the hospitality industry, with restaurants, some takeaways, pubs, cafes, and bars all forced to shut their doors.

That caused a sharp drop in demand for several foods produced in Britain. That demand has not yet picked back up, with many out-of-home businesses not selling food, and others are operating at a significantly reduced capacity.

The closure of fish and chip shops — a traditional British business — has been acutely felt by UK potato farmers.

The Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB) estimates that in a best-case scenario, there will be 95,000 tonnes of spare chipping potatoes piled up in stores across Britain at the end of this farming season.

Growers face a major dilemma in figuring out how to deal with this huge surplus of chipping potatoes.

The stores must be empty in time for July, when growers begin work on next season's produce. They are currently full of unwanted potatoes, with very few ways of getting rid of them available to growers.

Growers plan to donate part of the supply to food banks and charities. Some of the potatoes will become cattle feed where possible, and small amounts will be broken down using an industrial process called anaerobic digestion.

However, those measures combined will probably only have a limited impact, the ADHB's Robert Clayton told Business Insider.

""It won't get rid of the surplus, but it will help,"" he said. ""It's a real head-scratcher.""

The financial impact is also set to be significant. The average cost of producing a single tonne is £140, Clayton said.

The National Farmers Union's Alex Godfrey said, ""the closure of fish and chip shops and fast food outlets at the end of March deprived hundreds of thousands of tonnes of potatoes already in store of their planned routes to market.""

Godfrey, a potato grower who chairs the NFU's Potato Forum, told Business Insider: ""Longer-term impacts on the industry are hard to judge, but good, solid businesses have been rocked. I hope they don't tip over.""

It's not just growers of chipping potatoes who are struggling. The closure of fast food outlets in response to the COVID-19 outbreak has left farmers with similarly large piles of spare processed potatoes used to make fries.

A spokesperson for the Potato Processors' Association told Business Insider: ""We have seen volumes of chilled and frozen products, which were intended for food service, fall dramatically. Out-of-home sales have completely stopped.

""Whilst some product can be repurposed or repackaged, the increase in retail sales cannot compensate for the loss of the food service channels and this has led to a reduction in demand for processing raw materials.""

British farmers fear European potatoes could cross the channel

Potatoes are among several foods that are currently in oversupply in Britain.

Brits are being urged to eat more steak after the closure of the hospitality industry led to a collapse in demand for beef. There is also a surplus of milk and wheat, the Food and Drink Federation told Business Insider.

The impact of lockdown measures on potato farmers is being felt in mainland Europe too.

In Belgium, farmers are urging people to eat fries twice a week, the BBC reported, with around 750,000 tonnes of potatoes sat in warehouses across the country due to a sharp drop in demand.

Farmers in the UK fear producers in Belgium and elsewhere will attempt to export their surplus potatoes to Britain.

""The problem is much worse in mainland Europe,"" the AHDB's Clayton told Business Insider.

""What that means is there is the potential for millions of tons of frozen potatoes to come over the channel and bleed out into the British market at a cost so low that it would totally undermine British producers.

""It's making the whole situation a lot more frightening.""

A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs told Business Insider: ""We are working closely with our potato growers both to support them through this year's planting season.

""We have relaxed competition rules so our farmers can help to feed the nation during these unprecedented circumstances and we are supporting them to sell their produce to different markets as well as being ready to supply restaurants when they reopen.""",real

As significantly more people are using these videoconferencing services during the COVID-19 pandemic, the domains could be used to pose as official links, potentially tricking people into downloading malware or accidentally giving a bad actor access to personal information.

In just the last three weeks, for example, 2,449 Zoom-related domains have been registered, and Check Point Research determined that 32 of those domains are malicious and 320 are “suspicious.” And in one instance of attempted phishing, hackers sent an email that looks like an official email from Microsoft Teams, but a button in the email to “open” Teams was actually a malicious URL that downloaded malware to the user’s computer.

Hackers are also sending phishing emails posing as the World Health Organization

Hackers are also sending phishing emails posing as the World Health Organization with an attached file that downloads malware when clicked, Check Point Research said. The report also included the text of two emails soliciting donations for the WHO and the United Nations, but requesting that the donations be sent to “several known compromised” bitcoin wallets.

Google has observed donation scams in emails impersonating organizations like the WHO as well, and said in mid-April that it saw more than 18 million daily malware and phishing emails related to COVID-19 in just a week. The issue is prevalent enough that the WHO has an entire page dedicated to information about COVID-19 hackers and scammers.",real

Billionaire investor George Soros has reiterated his recent warning about the European Union’s possible fate, warning that the bloc could die from the economic calamity brought on by the coronavirus crisis unless it began issuing bonds to assist its weakest members.

“If the EU is unable to consider it now, it may not be able to survive the challenges it currently confronts,” Soros said in an email to reporters, his remarks cited by Reuters. “This is not a theoretical possibility; it may be the tragic reality,” he stressed.

According to the investor, issuing bonds to help countries would require Brussels to maintain a AAA credit rating, meaning the need to authorize new taxes to cover the bonds’ cost. “The taxes only have to be authorized; they don’t need to be implemented,” he insisted.

Soros also expanded on a subject he discussed at length last week – the German Constitutional Court’s ruling that the European Central Bank had overstepped its mandate with the purchase of government debt under its quantitative easing (i.e. cash printing) programme. The German court gave the bank a three-month ultimatum to justify the proportionality of the bond purchases, and warned that the Bundesbank would drop out of the programme if a solution was not found. In an unprecedented response, the European Commission threatened to sue Berlin.

In his remarks Friday, Soros suggested that “the relaxation of state aid rules, which favour Germany, has been particularly unfair to Italy, which was already the sick man of Europe and then the hardest hit by COVID-19.”

According to Soros, if Italy drops out of the EU, it might be the beginning of the end for the bloc. “What would be left of Europe without Italy?” he asked.

Soros isn’t alone in his concerns about the EU’s weak performance in the face of the coronavirus crisis. Last week, Bloomberg reported that Brussels’ failure to “mount a joint fiscal defence” against the coronavirus and the “lack of a cohesive fiscal policy” have already made the euro one of the weakest major Western currencies, sparking fresh fears about the bloc’s future.

Soros, the Hungarian-American hedge fund manager-turned activist, has been a vocal proponent of the European Union project since the 1990s. In the UK, he’s best known for sparking the 1992 run on the pound, which earned him his first billion dollar earning, but cost the British economy billions in losses. In 2002, he was convicted of insider trading in France. Elsewhere, he’s faced criticism for spending billions of dollars spreading his vision of a global, liberal, market-driven world order. He began his political activities in Eastern Europe in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Since then, his Open Societies Foundations have spread to over 60 countries, including not just developing nations, but the US and Western Europe as well. Russia kicked Open Society Foundations out of the country in 2015, listing their activities as a threat to national security.",fake

MELBOURNE — At an outer suburban manufacturing plant, engineer Byron Kennedy is resetting a machine to spray-print a layer of copper on to a door handle, aiming to use the metal's antiviral properties to counter the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic.
His firm Spee3D is better known as a producer of 3D printers for copper and aluminium, used by customers including the Australian defence force and U.S. Marines to rapidly print new parts to get broken equipment back in action without waiting days for spares to arrive.
""Up until the end of last year, our business was building the 3D printers, which were then used to build parts,"" Spee3D co-founder Kennedy told Reuters.
""Come 2020, and the epidemic hits. We know about the antimicrobial properties of copper, so we thought 'Can we do something, can we help out here?'""
Copper's disinfectant powers have long been known and its antibacterial, antiviral and anti-fungal properties have been supported by scientific studies.
Spee3D commissioned Melbourne laboratory 360biolabs to look at how SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, reacts to copper surfaces.
The results showed that 96% of the virus was killed off in two hours and 99.2% in 5 hours, compared to no change on stainless steel surfaces over the same period, Kennedy said.
This is in line with a U.S.-government funded study https://bit.ly/2WdhxZR published in March that found SARS-CoV-2 remained viable for up to 4 hours on copper, compared with 2 to 3 days on plastic and stainless steel.
Spee3D then reset some of its machines to be able to coat surfaces such as door handles and push plates, and has already received orders from two Australian government departments to resurface door handles before staff return to work.
The Northern Territory's Trade, Business and Innovation Department said in a statement it was thrilled to adopt the technology to make its workplace safer.
The firm is also speaking with a big miner and several major door handle manufacturers about additional applications, Kennedy said.
SLOW TAKE-UPCopper had already been making some inroads into the healthcare sector after trials in hospitals, including in the U.S. state of Virginia https://www.ajicjournal.org/article/S0196-6553(16)30696-4/fulltext, in recent years.
However, attempts by fabricators in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan to sell copper alloy products into the sector resulted in only a modest take-up, partly due to costs, said John Fennell, Chief Executive of the International Copper Association Australia.
""We are seeing outcrops of people adopting this, but not as much as you would have thought,"" he said.
COVID-19 looks set to give the metal a boost.In major copper producer Chile, the country's mines minister recently touted the use of copper in face masks, such as those produced by a U.S.-Chilean company, while U.S. miner Freeport McMoRan believes the pandemic will shine a light on how copper can help improve public health.
""Copper's use in health care equipment and facilities and in public places will undoubtedly grow significantly when the cost of copper, which has been a barrier in the past, is measured by the enormous cost to society that is being brought on by this pandemic,"" Freeport Chief Executive Richard Adkerson told a briefing last week.
New manufacturing techniques like 3D printing are also a potential game-changer as they can allow ultra-thin coatings to be applied quickly, while still taking advantage of copper's antimicrobial properties and cutting the amount of metal used, and therefore the cost.
The price of coating a standard office door handle is about A$50-A$100 ($33-$65), says Kennedy, although costs will fall over time.
Disappointing copper bulls, it's likely the new coating methods will keep a lid on the amount of metal used in healthcare, said analyst Lachlan Shaw of National Australia Bank in Melbourne.
""I think we can confidently say demand for copper for those uses will go up, quite possibly by a lot. Is that going to shift the dial for global demand? At this stage I doubt it,"" he said.

(CD) – America’s billionaires saw their combined net worth soar by $434 billion between March 18 and May 19 while the coronavirus pandemic killed tens of thousands of people and ravaged the U.S. economy, forcing more than 30 million out of work.

That’s according to a new analysis released Thursday by Americans for Tax Fairness (ATF) and the Institute for Policy Studies (IPS) titled “Tale of Two Crises: Billionaires Gain as Workers Feel Pandemic Pain.”

“The pandemic has revealed the deadly consequences of America’s yawning wealth gap, and billionaires are the glaring symbol of that economic inequality.” —Frank Clemente, Americans for Tax Fairness

The report shows that the five wealthiest billionaires in the U.S.—Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Bill Gates of Microsoft, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway, and Larry Ellison of Oracle—saw their collective wealth grow by a total of $75.5 billion between March 18 and May 19, a 19% jump.

ATF and IPS pinpoint March 18 as “the rough start date of the pandemic shutdown, when most federal and state economic restrictions were in place.”

Bezos—the world’s richest man—saw his wealth jump by nearly $35 billion in the two-month period. Yet even as Bezos’ fortune continues to grow, Amazon announced last week that it will not extend $2-an-hour hazard pay for warehouse workers beyond the end of May.

“The pandemic has revealed the deadly consequences of America’s yawning wealth gap, and billionaires are the glaring symbol of that economic inequality,” Frank Clemente, ATF’s executive director, said in a statement.

Chuck Collins, director of the IPS Program on Inequality, said “the surge in billionaire wealth during a global pandemic underscores the grotesque nature of unequal sacrifice.”

“While millions risk their lives and livelihoods as first responders and front line workers,” said Collins, “these billionaires benefit from an economy and tax system that is wired to funnel wealth to the top.”

Andrew Cuomo said that 66% of new hospitalizations in New York for Covid-19 were people who had been staying home. ""This is a surprise: Overwhelmingly, the people were at home,"" Cuomo said. ""We thought maybe they were taking public transportation, and we've taken special precautions on public transportation, but actually no, because these people were literally at home."" The ""shocking"" data came from a survey of more than 100 New York hospitals and about 1,300 new patients, Cuomo said. It raises the question: ""Of the people who are staying home, how rigorously are they staying at home?"" Stephen Morse, professor of epidemiology at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University, who focuses on risk assessment of infectious diseases, tells CNBC Make It. It's possible that as we enter the ninth and tenth week of fairly extreme prevention measures, people are feeling fatigued or getting too relaxed, says Joseph Vinetz, professor of medicine at the Yale School of Medicine and physician scientist in infectious diseases. ""Just because we're tired doesn't mean that the virus cares,"" he says. ""Viruses have no emotions; they just do their thing."" According to Cuomo, ""much of this comes down to what you do to protect yourself."" So from masks to groceries, here's a reminder checklist of the measures epidemiologists and infectious disease experts say you should still absolutely be following, even if you live in a place that's re-opening:

Use masks carefully

Since early April the Centers for Disease Control has suggested that people wear masks or cloth face coverings outside of the home to help prevent the spread of Covid-19. In addition to having a face mask to use, ""people have to be very careful about how they put them on and how they take some off,"" Morse says. Wash your hands before putting your mask on your face. Fit is key: Your mask should cover your nose and mouth snugly, but comfortably. ""There's a wire that goes over the nose piece that you have to mold to your nose,"" Vinetz says. ""Then you have to tuck [the mask] under your chin."" ""It's not hard [to wear a mask], but somebody has to kind of show people how to do it right,"" he adds. (This helpful video demonstrates how to wear a mask.) Indeed, wearing a mask can feel somewhat uncomfortable, but both for effective prevention and sanitary reasons, it's important to keep it on during your entire outing, instead of removing it to take breaks or talk to people. When you take your mask off, you should remove it without touching the front of it, and wash your hands afterwards, Morse says. ""If [masks] become contaminated and you touch them — even if your hands are clean — when you then touch your face afterwards you can infect yourself,"" he says. Reusable cloth masks should be cleaned regularly, per the CDC, which means after each time you wear it, or whenever it becomes soiled. You can wash masks in a washing machine with hot water, and tumble dry them with high heat.

Steer clear of people on the street

Most of us have heard that we need to be at least six feet from other people when out in public. ""That's not a magic number,"" but it's believed to be the distance necessary to prevent respiratory droplets from reaching you if someone sneezes or coughs, Morse says. Physical distance can be hard to come by. ""There's a limit to how far you can, especially in New York City, keep apart,"" Morse says. Try to avoid looking at people face-to-face when you're outside in crowded places, Morse says. ""It sounds strange,"" but it keeps you out of people's line of breath, he adds. You can also try to stagger how you're walking so that you're side-by-side with others, rather than directly behind someone.

Keep washing your hands diligently

Hand hygiene is still incredibly important, because it's easy to accidentally touch your face and infect yourself. ""You always want to make sure your hands are clean,"" Morse says. Wash your hands with soap and water or use hand sanitizer at all the normal times, he says. For example, wash your hands after going to the bathroom; after touching garbage; and before, during and after food prep. ""Also after you touch something on the outside and you come back inside,"" he says. That includes touching doorknobs, opening packages or pressing elevator buttons. Wearing gloves may give you a false sense of security, Vinetz says. If you do wear gloves, you should assume that your hands are dirty, and avoid touching your face. ""If anybody is wearing gloves, I look at them and say, 'You're contaminated, don't touch anything,'"" he says.

Be strategic about running errands

When you're running essential errands or frequenting businesses as they begin to open, you should still be extra careful. For starters, you definitely shouldn't be venturing out if you're sick, according to the CDC. Take fewer trips to the store to reduce the amount of exposure you have to other people, and order your food and medication for delivery if possible (and don't accept deliveries in-person), per the CDC. Opt to pay for your items online or over the phone, and use a contactless payment method if you can. If you do go to the store, stay at least six feet from other people and wear a cloth face covering or mask, the CDC says. Some stores have delineated a ""safe distance"" on the floor in checkout lines, and wipes available for patrons to disinfect shopping carts. But even still, you should not touch your eyes, nose or mouth throughout the duration of your trip. Once you're finished shopping, use hand sanitizer and wash your hands with soap and water when you're home.

Handle packages and groceries gingerly

Many people are relying on deliveries to get their groceries and other supplies with minimal contact. But there's evidence that the Covid-19 virus can survive on surfaces for hours to days. When you get a package or bring home a shopping bag, Morse suggests opening it outside of your home. ""Leave it outside the door, and then with clean hands, I would lift out the things that were inside,"" he says. If the contents look like they need to be cleaned, you can wipe them with a disinfectant, he says, but it's not totally necessary. Put the items on a surface that you can clean easily afterwards, and of course wash your hands, Morse says. ""There's only so much you can do, you know, within reason,"" he says.

Follow elevator etiquette

Riding the elevator with someone is a comparatively short time to be exposed to their germs, but you should still be mindful. ""Minimize the number of people in an elevator,"" Morse says. Elevators are slightly less crowded while people are staying home, so you should wait until you can catch a ride alone or with as few people as possible, he says. And wear a face mask while in the elevator, even if you're riding solo. Pressing buttons with a key or other inanimate object can't hurt, but you still need to wash your hands when you come home, he adds.

Francisco Morales Torres has spent the past year and a half locked up at the Dodge County jail in Juneau, Wisconsin, under the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

An immigration judge in Chicago granted Morales Torres asylum in 2019 and again in February, but government prosecutors have appealed both rulings. As those appeals make their way through the courts, Morales Torres — who has anxiety, depression and other mental illnesses — is unlikely to be released from ICE custody.

His lawyers have turned to the District Court of Eastern Wisconsin to win his release, arguing his prolonged detention violates the due process clause of the Constitution and puts him at risk of contracting COVID-19.

“A lot of us in here already didn’t know when we were going to see our families again, but now with the coronavirus, there’s an added fear of dying,” Morales Torres said in a phone call from Dodge County jail Wednesday. “We don’t know what’s going on. It’s only a matter of time before something happens.”

ICE declined to comment for this story citing pending litigation.

Court records show Morales Torres came to the United States in 2007 at age 13. He entered the country without proper authorization and was later taken into ICE custody and placed in deportation proceedings in September 2018 after several run-ins with the law, including a conviction for possession of a stolen vehicle.

While in detention, Morales Torres was granted asylum by Immigration Judge Kathryn De Angelis in April 2019 based on fears of being persecuted in Mexico for his sexual orientation and because he has acute psychiatric illnesses.

Government prosecutors appealed the ruling, and the case was returned to De Angelis in October 2019.

Five months later, De Angelis again granted Morales Torres protection from deportation as “he will face a substantial risk of torture if he is removed to Mexico because of his severe mental health illnesses, his lack of familial support, and his sexual orientation,” she wrote.

Prosecutors appealed De Angelis’ second ruling, which remains pending.

Keren Zwick, one of three attorneys at the National Immigrant Justice Center working on Morales Torres’ case, said it could take more than a year before the courts get through both appeals. Zwick worries that by then the coronavirus will have reached Dodge County.

“These facilities routinely take in people from other county jails or detention centers where outbreaks of the virus have been confirmed,” she said. “Congregate settings like these are ill-equipped to handle the virus.”

As of last week, there were 30,000 immigrants in ICE custody. So far, the agency has tested 995 of them for the coronavirus and 449 tested positive, including 12 at a county jail in downstate Illinois.

SUMMARY: Yes, but what about our plan for the coronavirus? Layoffs are horrible, but kudos to Airbnb for handling them as well as possible. People are increasingly ignoring distancing measures. Dr. Fauci as sex symbol.

What's our plan, Mr. President?

President Trump says we're moving into the next phase of our coronavirus response — reopening. He's acknowledging that the death counts will be much higher than he thought only a few weeks ago. He's urging Americans to view themselves as ""warriors"" and return to their lives.

Trump's motivation for reopening the economy is obvious: Our lives have been upended by the coronavirus, and our economy has been destroyed. The ""cure"" may not be worse than the disease, but it's terrible.

The president's logic is also understandable. We cannot stay ""locked down"" forever. On our current trajectory, it would take us months if not years to crush the virus the way South Korea, Germany, New Zealand, Australia, Austria, and other countries have. So continuing with the status quo indefinitely is not really an option.

But giving up on the coronavirus and focusing just on the economy is appalling, especially considering how well other countries like South Korea and Germany have dealt with this crisis.

After all, there's a lot more we could be doing. As Derek Thompson explains in The Atlantic, only a couple of months ago, South Korea and the US had the same number of cases and deaths. Now, thanks to an aggressive and competent government response, South Korea has reduced new cases of the virus to a trickle, while the US death toll is 72,000 and climbing.

We know what the president's economic plan is: Reopen the country.

But it is fair to also ask what his coronavirus plan is.

There are really only two options.

Double down. Ramp up the aggressive response that has worked in South Korea and elsewhere: Continue to build testing, contact-tracing, and isolation capacity. Order companies to make more personal protection equipment and healthcare capacity. Give funding to states and municipalities. Form partnerships with other countries. Do whatever else can be done to reduce deaths and sickness and control the spread.

Ramp up the aggressive response that has worked in South Korea and elsewhere: Continue to build testing, contact-tracing, and isolation capacity. Order companies to make more personal protection equipment and healthcare capacity. Give funding to states and municipalities. Form partnerships with other countries. Do whatever else can be done to reduce deaths and sickness and control the spread. Hope for the best. Hope we get a treatment or vaccine or reach ""herd immunity"" before too many more people die.

Trump appears to be pursuing the second option.

What's particularly frustrating and mystifying about this is that the president doesn't have to choose. He could have his cake and eat it, too. He has nearly unlimited resources. He could cautiously reopen the country and double down on mitigation and control measures.

After all, the choice here is not the coronavirus OR the economy — it's both.

Our economy won't repair itself until we all feel safe eating out, traveling, attending events, and socializing in groups again. And it won't be a government mandate that makes us feel safe. It will be seeing the number of infections and deaths continuing to drop.

So let's hope the president does more than just hope for the best.

Airbnb shows the right way to conduct layoffs during the pandemic

Tuesday's news that Airbnb is laying off 25% of its 7,500 employees is sad and not at all surprising, given how the pandemic has devastated the travel industry.

But as Shana Lebowitz reports in Insider, how Airbnb is carrying out the layoffs should be a model for other struggling companies.

Executives usually screw up this process, spreading fear by letting news of layoffs dribble out in advance, callously firing people in large groups, and not bothering to explain the strategic reason for layoffs.

Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky did everything right, Lebowitz concludes. Chesky's memo explained the strategic reasoning behind the layoffs, prepared those being laid off for one-on-one meetings with managers, offered generous severance, benefits, and career counseling, and, perhaps most important, treated those losing their jobs with compassion.

""I am truly sorry. Please know this is not your fault,"" Chesky wrote. ""The world will never stop seeking the qualities and talents that you brought to Airbnb ... that helped make Airbnb. I want to thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for sharing them with us.""

People are increasingly ignoring coronavirus restrictions, and that's alarming

Everywhere you look there are signs of rising noncompliance with our social-distancing guidelines.

In one Miami Beach park, police verbally warned more than 7,000 people about mask-wearing, prompting authorities to shut the just opened park back down. A guard at a Family Dollar was shot dead by a customer when he tried to enforce Michigan's mandatory mask policy. The Wisconsin Supreme Court looks likely to throw out the state's stay-at-home order, with one justice calling it ""the very definition of tyranny."" Even Trump and Vice President Pence have been modeling noncompliance by declining to wear face masks in places where they're recommended or required.

What a pickle! It's possible to create a virtuous cycle with restrictive public-health measures, as we've seen in countries such as Korea and New Zealand: Clear government communication, strict controls, and competence persuade people to comply with restrictive orders. The public then sees the crisis abate, appreciates the strict measures, and trusts the government to guide the reopening.

Instead, we've put ourselves in a vicious cycle. Unclear leadership, ambiguous rules, and government incompetence cast doubt on the control measures. Physical distancing can only suppress the epidemic if the vast majority of us practice it, and the vast majority will practice it only if they support it and think it's a legitimate recommendation from trusted authorities. But if the authorities themselves don't practice it, or label it tyranny as in Wisconsin, or are too heavy handed as in Miami, compliance will wane, and the disease will rise.

That's the direction we're heading. And what's unsettling is that once the public's trust is lost, the government will have a tough time regaining it. If we botched this first effort so badly, will enough of us follow government restrictions if the disease keeps flaring up?

662,https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/7/21250830/waymo-self-driving-resume-testing-coronavirus-arizona-drivers-concerns,2020-05-07,"As Waymo resumes self-driving tests, backup drivers are still worried about the virus","Waymo is planning to resume testing its autonomous vehicles in Arizona on May 11th, nearly two months after pausing its robotaxi service as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. But some of the company’s backup drivers are worried that Waymo may be rushing back into service too quickly.

In a blog post, the company said it was taking a “tiered approach” to returning its vehicles to the road. Waymo says it has redesigned its vehicle depots in Arizona to conform with social distancing guidelines, including limiting the number of people that will be allowed inside at any given time. Employees will receive personal protective gear, like face masks and gloves. And the facilities and the company’s fleet of autonomous vehicles will be cleaned multiple times a day.

In addition, employees will receive temperature checks when arriving for work each day. And employees who are at high risk for COVID-19, or who have child care issues, can opt to work from home. Each vehicle will only feature one backup driver during testing to comply with social distancing guidelines.

But the company won’t be fully operational. Waymo’s ride-hailing service, Waymo One, will remain on pause. And Waymo says it won’t resume testing in other cities like San Francisco, Detroit, and Los Angeles until the company is convinced it’s safe.

“We’re taking a thoughtful and measured approach towards bringing our driving operations back on the road”

“We’re taking a thoughtful and measured approach towards bringing our driving operations back on the road,” the company said in a blog post.

But the company’s operations team, which is largely comprised of employees who work for Waymo’s third-party contractor — a French transit company called Transdev North America — is not all convinced of the company’s commitment to safety.

“The measures they’re taking seem above and beyond on paper,” said one Arizona-based backup driver. “But at the same time, Arizona hasn’t seen 14 days of new case decline yet either.”

There have been almost 10,000 cases of COVID-19 in Arizona, and 450 deaths, according to AZ Central. The state’s Republican Governor Doug Ducey announced recently the phased reopening of the state’s businesses, including salons, restaurants, and coffee shops.

One member of Waymo’s operations team, who is based at the company’s Mountain View, California headquarters, expressed concern that Waymo will try to resume testing too early. Most the test rides in California are done with two employees in the vehicle. Unlike Arizona, very few of the company’s California ops team is trained to ride in the company’s autonomous vehicles by themselves, the driver said. (A Waymo spokesperson said the majority of Waymo’s drivers are trained and certified to drive in a single-driver configuration.)

“But at the same time, Arizona hasn’t seen 14 days of new case decline yet either”

“It feels like they’re using [Arizona] as a control group to decide if they can push us back in,” said the driver. “Arizona has always gotten test policies and whatnot first, but this seems like way too large of a risk since the number of deaths and cases is still increasing.” (A Waymo spokesperson noted that driving operations first resumed at the company’s closed testing site in Central California two weeks ago.)

As The Verge has previously reported, tension is high between Waymo and its operation staff since the company signed a contract with Transdev last year. Vacation time was cut, health insurance didn’t improve, and issues of workplace safety went unaddressed, according to a half-dozen workers who spoke to The Verge for a story last month. And drivers said they were increasingly nervous about picking up passengers amid the growing COVID-19 pandemic, and that the outbreak is exposing divisions between drivers and full-time employees at the Google spinoff.

But Waymo has continued to pay its workers despite two months of downtime, while other self-driving companies have cut their operations staff. The Arizona-based driver said the company appears to be listening to employee concerns about rushing too quickly back into testing and ride-hailing.

“[Waymo One] was a huge sticking point with drivers at the beginning of this,” the driver said, “so hopefully they got the message and don’t even consider it until we are at whatever our new normal is.”

1521,https://www.healthnutnews.com/newsweek-doubts-over-oxford-covid-19-vaccine-after-animals-tested-catch-virus/,2020-05-20,NEWSWEEK: Doubts over Oxford COVID-19 Vaccine After Animals Tested Catch Virus,"The Oxford University vaccine lauded as a “front runner” in the race to develop a coronavirus treatment does not stop the virus in monkeys and may only be partially effective, experts warn.

The British government has pledged to invest $24 million to support teams at Oxford University joined in the global race to find a vaccine. However, following the publication of detailed trial results last week, it was discovered that the vaccine failed to prevent monkeys from catching the COVID-19 virus.

The vaccine, called ChAdOx1, was trialed in rhesus macaque monkeys, exposing six of them to COVID-19. A control group of three non-vaccinated monkeys was also infected. Then, both the immunized and non-immunized monkeys were monitored for seven days for signs of developing COVID-19.

This has led to experts doubting the vaccine’s effectiveness, should it be approved for more extensive use among the population, and in particular about whether it will be able to prevent the spread of the virus between affected individuals.

RELATED STORY:

Former Harvard Medical School professor Dr. William Haseltine, who had a pivotal role in the development of early HIV/Aids treatments, said:

“It is crystal clear that the vaccine did not provide sterilizing immunity to the virus challenge, the gold standard for any vaccine. It may provide partial protection.” “All of the vaccinated monkeys treated with the Oxford vaccine became infected when challenged, as judged by recovery of virus genomic RNA from nasal secretions.”

RELATED STORY:

He wrote in an article on Forbes:

“There was no difference in the amount of viral RNA detected from this site in the vaccinated monkeys as compared to the unvaccinated animals. Which is to say, all vaccinated animals were infected.”

Dr. Haseltine added that although all of the monkeys were infected with the virus, none suffered from pneumonia, which suggests the vaccine could help fight the severity of COVID-19, which may give hope to some.

Dr. Penny Ward, a visiting professor in pharmaceutical medicine at King’s College London, said:

“It is helpful to see that monkeys vaccinated with this SARS-CoV-2 vaccine did not have any evidence of enhanced lung pathology and that, despite some evidence of upper respiratory tract infection by SARS COV2 after high viral load virus challenge, monkeys given the vaccine did not have any evidence of pneumonia.”

Recommendations on how to protect ourselves from contracting the virus that causes COVID-19 are everywhere, like washing your hands, wearing a mask, and staying at least 6 feet away from people outside your home. But not all risks are created equal; home, public transportation and the grocery store all have different challenges.

A blog post by University of Massachusetts Dartmouth professor, Dr. Erin Bromage, who studies immunity of infectious diseases in animals, titled ""The Risks - Know Them - Avoid Them"" garnered major attention for showing that some of the highest risk areas may not be what you'd expect.

A lot of attention is being spent on opening up the economy, but it seems like the highest risk is more likely your own living room.

The data suggests that most people will get infected in their home, according to Bromage.

Tune into ABC at 1 p.m. ET and ABC News Live at 4 p.m. ET every weekday for special coverage of the novel coronavirus with the full ABC News team, including the latest news, context and analysis.

So where are the highest risk areas in the community for getting infected?

""The general theme of what I can see is, lots of people together in an enclosed environment with poor airflow and usually some sort of talking or singing involved leads to lots of people in that environment getting infected,"" said Bromage, in an interview with ABC News.

Case studies that traced back COVID-19 outbreaks at the beginning of the pandemic, have found that the main sources of infections in the community lead back to the workplace, public transportation, social gatherings, and restaurants — indoor environments, with limited air circulation, and many people spending a prolonged period of time in the same place.

Some of the biggest outbreaks, excluding nursing homes, in fact, that have been reported and traced occurred in prisons, religious ceremonies, choir practices, indoor sporting events, and even birthday parties.

""You've got a lot of people in an enclosed space with lots of huffing, puffing, or yelling, which just led to large outbreak events,"" Bromage said.

Being exposed to the virus does not automatically mean you will be infected. A successful infection is dependent on the time exposed to the virus and the amount of viral particles you are exposed to. For example, ""While joggers may be releasing more virus due to deep breathing, remember the exposure time is also less due to their speed,"" Bromage writes.

Scientists call the amount of exposure to the virus that leads to infection the ""infectious dose."" Although scientists are still learning more about how many viral particles lead to infection, they do know that sneezing and coughing release the highest amount of viral material into the air, and you're more likely to become infected if you're in a confined space.

A single sneeze, according to Bromage, has been estimated to release about 30,000 droplets that can travel up to 200 miles per hour, which means it could easily cross a room. A cough releases round 3,000 droplets that can travel around 50 miles per hour. These particles may drop to the ground or could hang around in the air for a short period of time.

In fact, a recently published study showed that speaking loudly in an enclosed space creates ""substantial"" risk of transmitting the virus to others. Prolonged contact and lots of direct talking, breathing, and yelling between individuals increases the direct exposure to viral particles, which increases the likelihood for infection.

The amount of virus a person release changes over the course of the infection and varies by person. This is dependent on the infected persons' viral load, which is the amount of the virus detected in a test sample from a patient and reflects how well the virus is replicating.

Many people are asymptomatic and may easily spread the virus, unknowingly, by directly talking, singing, yelling, or even breathing around other people in close contact. This is why the CDC advises that everyone wear face coverings in public.

Bromage underscores that the exact number of people infected by respiratory droplets versus transmission through touching contaminated objects like door handles and elevator buttons is unknown, which is why it's also important to wash your hands often and avoid touching your face. But the compilation of studies he wrote, ""serves to highlight that being in an enclosed space, sharing the same air for a prolonged period increases your chances of exposure and infection.""

In very high-risk situations, social distancing guidelines are not as effective because even if you are far away from an infected individual in a small, poorly ventilated enclosed space for a long period of time, a low dose of the virus in the air can reach you and over a sustained period of time may be enough to cause infection.

Bromage said that the activities many typically view as highest risk for infection like grocery shopping might not be as risky if you're spending a brief amount of time at the store, you're avoiding other shoppers, not speaking directly with people, and the store restricts the number of people that can enter at a given time.

Public bathrooms may also pose a risk, but for slightly different reasons, said Bromage. Bathrooms have a lot of high touch surfaces like door handles, faucets, and countertops.

So far, the science seems to suggest that outdoor areas and large ventilated spaces are the lowest risk areas for infection. Outdoor areas are generally safer because wind and infinite air space could dilute the viral particles circulating. If you are actively moving outside that also reduces the exposure time to any viral particles hanging around.

With restrictions lifted in some states, many Americans will face a new challenge: ""Just because something is open doesn't mean it is an instruction to go,"" said Dr. Andrew Noymer, associate professor of population health at UC Irvine.

Before you put yourself in a high-risk situation, Bromage suggests asking yourself, ""Are there too many people here and how much time have they spent here? Are there loud talkers? Singing or yelling? What's the amount of people in my area that actually are infected?"" If you are in an environment with a lot of people, you should also assess what changes the business owner put in place to lower the risk of virus spreading.

If you choose to meet other people, you should also consider their level of exposure and health status. Ask your friends or family where they have been, how often they go to the store and whether they have been staying home, suggests Dr. Henry Raymond, epidemiologist and associate professor at Rutgers University.

""It's not just about your health but about the health of those people around you,"" Raymond said.

If you know your friend or relative has underlying health conditions or is at an increased risk of developing severe symptoms due to a weaker immune system you should take extra precautions to avoid exposing them to the virus. If your state permits social gatherings and you decide to meet up, keep it to a small group and make it safe as possible by staying outside, Raymond said. Agree on some ground rules, such as: ""We don't shake hands, we bring our own food, we space the chair out at least 6 feet away.""

""The best course of action is to be personally cautious and personally responsible. We don't have a vaccine. But we do have social distancing and masks,"" said Raymond.

HCQ breakthrough: ICMR finds it’s effective in preventing coronavirus, expands its use

Three studies find that hydroxychloroquine reduces chances of contracting Covid, so ICMR allows more frontline workers to take it as a preventive drug.

By Himani Chandna

New Delhi: The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the country’s apex body in the field, has found that consuming the drug hydroxychloroquine reduces the chances of getting infected with Covid-19.

As a result, ICMR released an advisory Friday to expand the usage of HCQ — an anti-malarial drug — as a preventive treatment against the novel coronavirus.

The conclusion has been drawn on the basis of three studies conducted by the ICMR.

The advisory suggests surveillance workers, paramilitary and police personnel, as well as medical staff working in non-Covid hospitals and blocks to start consuming the pill as “preventive therapy”.

ICMR had issued an advisory to begin using HCQ in March, but it had drawn criticism for lacking scientific evidence that the drug works against the novel coronavirus.

The studies

According to the advisory, the premier health body undertook investigation at three central government hospitals in New Delhi. While it did not reveal the names of the hospitals, it said the investigation indicates that “amongst healthcare workers involved in Covid-19 care, those on HCQ prophylaxis were less likely to develop SARS-CoV-2 infection, compared to those who were not on it”.

The advisory also states that the National Institute of Virology in Pune has found in laboratory testing that HCQ reduces the viral load.

The ICMR also analysed data collected previously, known as retrospective case-control analysis, and found “a significant” relationship between “the number of doses taken and frequency of occurrence of Covid-19 infection in symptomatic healthcare workers who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection”.

It further said “the benefit was less pronounced in healthcare workers caring for a general patient population”.

Another observational study was conducted among 334 healthcare workers at the country’s largest public hospital, New Delhi’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). The 248 workers who took HCQ as preventive drug for an average of six weeks had lower incidence of the infection than those not taking the pill.

Which workers will use it now?

Based on the findings of the studies, the government has decided to administer the drug as a ‘prophylaxis’ or preventive therapy to asymptomatic healthcare workers working in non-Covid hospitals as well as non-Covid blocks of hospitals earmarked for Covid treatment.

Asymptomatic frontline workers, such as surveillance workers deployed in containment zones, as well as paramilitary and police personnel involved in Covid-related activities will be asked to pop HCQ pills.

Until now, only high-risk individuals, including asymptomatic healthcare workers involved in containment and treatment of Covid-19 patients, and asymptomatic household contacts of laboratory-confirmed cases, were being administered the drug. They will continue to consume the drug.

While the dosage will remain the same as before, eight weeks, the ICMR advisory suggests that it can be used beyond that period as well, but with close monitoring.

“With available evidence for its safety and beneficial effect as a prophylactic drug against SARS-CoV-2 during the earlier recommended 8 weeks period, the experts further recommended for its use beyond 8 weeks on weekly dosage with strict monitoring of clinical and ECG parameters, which would also ensure that the therapy is given under supervision,” it stated.

“In clinical practice, HCQ is commonly prescribed in a daily dose of 200mg to 400mg for treatment of diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus for prolonged treatment periods with good tolerance,” the advisory added.

Discontinue if ‘rare side effects’ are noted

The ICMR had earlier announced that some side effects, such as abdominal pain and nausea, have been observed in healthcare workers who were administered HCQ.

The anti-malaria drug is often blamed for triggering irregular heartbeat.

However, in the final results of the studies (HCQ prophylaxis among 1,323 healthcare workers), the ICMR found mild adverse effects such as nausea in 8.9 per cent workers, abdominal pain in 7.3 per cent, vomiting in 1.5 per cent, low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) in 1.7 per cent and cardio-vascular effects in 1.9 per cent.

The advisory states the drug should be discontinued if it causes the “rare” side effects related to the heart, such as cardiomyopathy, a disease which makes it harder for heart to pump blood to the entire body, and heart-rate disorders.

The advisory mentions that HCQ, in rare cases, can cause visual disturbance, including “blurring of vision, which is usually self-limiting and improves on discontinuation of the drug”.

ICMR has clarified that “for the above cited reasons — heart and vision — the drug has to be given under strict medical supervision with an informed consent”.",fake

Pew tweeted, “Hispanics are the most supportive of the federal government providing medical and economic support to undocumented immigrants affected by the coronavirus outbreak.”

Approximately two-thirds of U.S. adults (68 percent) believe the federal government has an obligation to provide medical care to illegal aliens who caught the Wuhan virus. Additionally, 37 percent stated that the government should supply economic aid to illegal aliens who have lost their job due to the outbreak, according to a Pew Research Center survey that was conducted from April 29 to May 5.

Hispanics were the group most in favor of the federal government allocating medical and economic resources to illegal immigrants affected by the Wuhan virus outbreak. The vast majority of Hispanics (86 percent) say the government has an obligation to provide medical care, and 62 percent had similar thoughts about economic help. Hispanic immigrants are more likely than American-born Hispanics (68 percent vs. 55 percent) to support federal economic help for illegal aliens affected by the outbreak. However, the views between the two groups were more similar regarding medical care (88 percent vs. 83 percent).

An overwhelming majority of black adults (80 percent) also believe that the federal government must provide medical care, while roughly half 55 percent say the government should provide economic aid to illegal aliens impacted by the Wuhan virus. On the other hand, far lower number of white adults believe the government should administer medical care (61 percent) and economic help (27 percent).

BLP previously reported on some of Pew Research’s findings regarding Hispanics’ views on the scope of government.

On issues from gun control to healthcare, Hispanics expressed favorable views towards a more activist state.

Policymakers must understand the political implications of our current mass migration paradigm.

Many Hispanics are great people, and have even expressed strong support for immigration restriction.

To facilitate their assimilation and of millions of other immigrant groups as well, a moratorium on migration should be in order.

When you search using terms like “COVID-19 test” or “coronavirus test,” places that offer COVID-19 tests will be marked on your map. If you start typing COVID-19 into the search bar, you’ll also see the “COVID-19 Testing” search term appear at the top of your search bar, like what you’d see if you started typing something like “groceries” or “coffee shops.”

Apple’s information cards for the testing sites include the site’s hours, address, and phone number, as well as a warning that “COVID-19 testing may require a doctor’s referral and an appointment at the testing center” and a link to the website of the healthcare provider offering the test.

Apple launched a portal to let healthcare providers submit their information

The new testing sites in Apple Maps follow Apple launching a web portal last week to let hospitals and healthcare providers submit their information to be shown on Apple Maps, which was spotted by 9to5Mac.

Google began listing COVID-19 test centers in search results for much of the US on April 17th, and as part of those results, you can see testing centers near you displayed on a map except if you live in Maine, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Oregon, or Pennsylvania. But it appears the search company doesn’t show nearly as many test centers when you search for them directly in Google Maps as Apple does on Apple Maps.

Apple’s app shows a number of test centers in Arizona, for example, while searching for a test center on Google Maps for the state doesn’t show a testing center there. However, if you do a Google search for COVID-19 testing in Arizona, Google will surface a map with some test centers in the state. Google tells The Verge that it’s working to bring testing center information to Google Maps in addition to search results.

Apple has also made some updates to its mobility trends site, including adding more cities such as Las Vegas, New Orleans, Portland, Salt Lake City, and San Diego.

Apple and Google have also teamed up on a coronavirus tracking system that will be built into iOS and Android.

Update April 28th, 9:08PM ET: Clarified that Google does show testing centers in maps in search results, but does not show as many centers when searching for them in Google Maps.

Correction: We stated in the latest update to this story that Google search results for COVID-19 testing in New York City surfaces testing centers in the city on a map. It does not. We regret the error. We have changed the example used in this story to Arizona to provide a more accurate comparison of data shown across Apple Maps, Google Maps, and the map surfaced in Google search results.",real

“We think that there’s going to be substantial improvement this summer,” Clorox chairman and CEO Benno Dorer told Yahoo Finance in an interview. “It’s going to be touch and go until then, unfortunately.”

Shoppers have become increasingly frustrated as they scour the internet and local stores for Lysol sprays and Clorox wipes, only to find shelves picked clean after households stocked up on cleaning products to protect against infection, especially in COVID-19 hot zones.

Manufacturers like Clorox were not prepared for skyrocketing demand in a sleepy sector with reliably steady sales that usually fluctuate only during flu season.

On a third-quarter earnings call last week, Dorer told analysts that Clorox saw demand for disinfectant products increase more than 500%.

“Demand has been clearly unprecedented, and we’re in uncharted territory for our supply chain, in particular, in disinfecting products,” he said.

Products such as Clorox 4-in-1 Disinfecting Spray and Lysol Disinfectant Spray are among the products that the Environmental Protection Agency says likely protect against the spread of the coronavirus.

Disinfectant manufacturers have cranked up production, narrowed the number of products they make and have invested in increased capacity to try to catch up with skyrocketing demand.

“To try and meet demand to the greatest extent possible, we’ve been running our cleaning and disinfecting product plants 24/7,” Dorer told analysts last week. “To increase output, we’ve accessed third-party supply sources focused on manufacturing of disinfecting products and those that can be supplied most quickly, and we’ve been partnering with suppliers and retailers to get product where it is needed the most.”

Tom Derry, CEO of the Institute for Supply Management, told USA TODAY last month that shoppers would not be able to easily buy disinfectant wipes and other cleaning products again until June. But he predicted intermittent shortages could persist for months.

Last week, Clorox reported that third-quarter sales rose 15%, buoyed by purchases of bleach, wipes and other cleaning products. The company’s cleaning segment, which includes disinfectant wipes, bleach and Pine-Sol, saw sales growth of 32%, the company reported.

In a culture shift, Americans are more open about their personal finance struggles.","With her family still waiting on an economic impact payment of $3,900, Stephanie Dann of Millsboro, Delaware, decided it was time to share about more than her latest failed attempt to reach the Internal Revenue Service.

So she created the ""Still no Stimulus Check"" Facebook page on April 29.

""I am a stay at home mom of 4 kiddos,"" Dann, 28, wrote Wednesday in a post to the more than 1,000 members. She added that her husband is a kitchen manager at Chick-fil-A and his hours have been cut during the coronavirus pandemic. ""We are behind on our rent, car payment and electric bill. We have applied for assistance but (we're) afraid we might not meet the requirements.""

Motivated by delays in receiving their stimulus checks, people like Dann have created online groups that have attracted tens of thousands of members – and they’re doing more than just venting at the IRS. They’re also connecting in a personal way and, like Dann, disclosing details of their lives that might have been considered too sensitive to discuss publicly before the pandemic.

""We were depending on this check to get caught up with our bills,"" Dann told USA TODAY, whose family is expecting a two-person federal stimulus check bolstered by the $500 per child bonus.

Dann, who said she works one day at week at Chick-fil-A and handles mobile orders, said this is the first time she has created a private group on Facebook and that she did it to bring people together. Comments at ""Still no Stimulus Check"" reflect a potential shift toward more openness about personal financial matters.

Kimberly Dyer, who lives in Nashville and starts her day by checking the Facebook page. Dyer, along with Dann, serves as co-administrator of the private group

""We're hurting,'' said Dyer, 30. ""It just doesn't make sense.''

The mother of one, said the $1,700 in stimulus funds she is waiting on are critical because she is a foster care coordinator who has taken a 50% pay cut during the pandemic. Recently, Dyer said, she found herself sharing with members of the Facebook group that she had fallen behind on her rent payments.

""That’s not something I would ever tell anyone,"" she said. ""But it’s like we’re all in the same situation. We’re all struggling.""

Anecdotal evidence suggests more people are seeking financial advice and talking about their plight more openly during the pandemic, said Geoffrey Brown, CEO of the National Association of Personal Financial Advisors.

Brown said financial advisers and financials planners are talking about the current situation as ""excellent example of the intersection of money and psychology.''

""Meaning that in the past we’ve had economic crises where people have felt it in their pocketbook and there was a psychological component to that,'' Brown said. ""But now you’re dealing with a health crisis and an economic crisis and I think it’s just really causing people to be a little bit more open, a little bit more forthcoming in how it’s effecting their lives in total.

""If this had happened 20 years ago, looking at it holistically we wouldn’t have had access to the communications mediums that we do now. So you couldn’t jump into a Facebook where you’re disclosing that sort of information.""

Lisa Gale of Springfield, Missouri, recently wrote in the ""Still no Stimulus Check"" groupthat she had 73 cents in her bank account and is living in a motel. (She told USA TODAY she is a vacation planner for Wyndham Destinations and has been unable to work during the pandemic.)

Kaydee Robinson of Oklahoma City wrote that she needs the stimulus funds in part because she is pregnant with her second child who is due June 7.

Amanda Butler Baldonado of East Layton, Utah, wrote that she and her husband have eight children, including three that have ""severe medical needs,"" and she is an independent contractor who has been out of work since March 12. ""We are barely surviving,"" she wrote.

Sharing your financial struggles can be daunting

Similarly, Alyssa Snyder, who started the Facebook page ""Updated Not Stimulated,"" said she is wary of scammers who use tales of distress to solicit money.

""You have to decipher if it was a real story of not,"" said Snyder, 32, who lives in Washington Court, Ohio with her husband and two children. She said she recently received the $3,400 stimulus funds her family was due. ""People have hearts and want to help people.""

In fact, Snyder said, members of her private group donated about $500 in gift cards, along with gift baskets from members who make homemade skin care products and homemade lip gloss.

Rather than shuttering the group after most of the approximately 4,000 members received their stimulus funds, Snyder said, she renamed it ""Consequential Strangers"" and maintained the community.

""When I started this page, I didn’t think it would become anything like this,"" she said. ""I was just trying to get answers and seeing if anybody was in the same situation I was in.""

On another platform but with a similar thought, Andrew Gardiner of Stoors, Connecticut, said he was stunned to watch the ""stimuluscheck"" subreddit he created on Reddit attract more than 20,000 members.

Gardiner, 24, who builds websites and does online marketing, said he received $1,200 in stimulus funds April 15 by direct deposit. But he has stayed active on the subreddit that he created to be a source of information and also has become something more.

Baby photos have been posted, someone offered to buy pizza for people who were hungry and the comments kept on flooding in.

""I WANT TO PUNCH THE IRS WEBSITE,"" wrote Dunkaroosarecool.

""Yep,"" wrote Reddit user uiguigoo. ""I make 30k a year. … rent (was)due Friday and I've already missed two months. Can't be evicted(right now), but gonna leave voluntarily to avoid more late fees.""

This week, user uiguigoo indicated they are still is waiting on stimulus funds.

""I don't care anymore,"" they wrote. ""Already kicked out of my apartment. I'm living out of my car now. I'm already in debt due to late fees and missed payments. I'm already ruined. $1,200 won't do (anything) for me now.""

IM_NOT_BALD_YET chimed in: ""I’m just here to cheer you all on. Fingers crossed!""

For many people, starting a company in the midst of a global economic crisis is the last thing on their lockdown to-do list. But it might not be such a crazy idea. According to entrepreneurs and start-up investors CNBC spoke with, now might even be the best time to start thinking about setting up a new venture from home. The coronavirus pandemic is in many ways serving as a ""catalyst to creation,"" Index Ventures Partner Jan Hammer told CNBC. He thinks history may be on the side of entrepreneurs building their businesses at a time of adversity. ""If history gives us a good precedent, out of the last crisis — which was the great financial crisis of 2008 to 2010 — a cohort of extremely resilient businesses have emerged,"" Hammer said in an interview. He cited examples such as food delivery firm Just Eat, payments company Adyen and money transfer start-up TransferWise, which were all founded in 2001, 2006 and 2011 respectively. ""These were ideas born in, you could argue, difficult times,"" Hammer added. ""And in a way, the trends that had driven the growth of these businesses were unrelated to the macroeconomic cycle.""

There are plenty of businesses which were founded during or around the time of economic crises. General Motors, IBM and HP are some of the biggest names that were born out of downturns, such as the panic of 1907 and the Great Depression. Meanwhile, many tech start-ups, such as Groupon, Uber and Pinterest, were established during or shortly after the Great Recession.

Building new ventures

Lara Vandenberg launched Publicist, an online marketplace for businesses to find freelancers in PR and communications, on Tuesday. Usually New York-based, Vandenberg temporarily moved back to her native Australia as the coronavirus hit the U.S., but pressed on regardless of the time difference. Around 35% of the U.S. workforce — or 57 million people — are freelance, according to a report by jobs website Upwork, and the pandemic has accelerated a move to project-based work, Vandenberg said. Publicist is about to close a funding round after bootstrapping the beta site, though isn't disclosing how much it has raised. It will charge hirers 20% commission per project. ""Although we are launching a company at this really volatile point in this macro economy, the future of work is an area people are really excited about,"" Vandenberg told CNBC. ""And in parallel, it's just an exciting problem to solve.""

For Chris Howard, co-founder at venture fund Fuel Capital, now is a good time to promote a new company because ad space is cheaper. ""You have an increase in the amount of time that users are spending online,"" he told CNBC. ""You can get a better understanding of cost per new customer that you're adding … then you can begin retention marketing campaigns.""

Saying goodbye to 'bulls--t jobs'

Matt Clifford heads up Entrepreneur First, a so-called ""talent investor"" out of London that helps founders network with each other and develop their business ideas. ""We're not seeing a reduction in applications, which is really interesting — and I'll be honest, I thought we would,"" Clifford told CNBC. "" I can totally identify with the mindset where you say now is not the time to quit a job."" ""It's also a time where a lot of things look pretty trivial,"" he added. ""There's this whole thing about 'bulls--t jobs' that's sort of been going around for about a decade now."" By ""bulls--t jobs,"" Clifford is referring to roles that workers feel don't have a meaningful impact on society.

Should he work?

With events canceled left and right, restaurant and bar workers furloughed and people avoiding unnecessary travel, workers from stand-up comics to wedding planners to housekeepers are finding themselves suddenly unemployed. And those who haven’t been told to stay home say they are being left with the choice between earning a paycheck and doing their part to promote social distancing and stop the spread of the virus.

“If I got someone sick, I would feel terrible,” Sanchez, a driver for Uber and Lyft, said from his home Wednesday, where he is in quarantine and waiting the result of his COVID-19 test, which he took after he realized he was exposed to someone who is infected.

As a founder of Gig Workers Matter, a group that organizes and advocates for gig workers, he said coronavirus has shined a light on the struggles faced by workers with no company support services to fall back on, no healthcare and limited savings.

“It shows how much we need something throughout the year, not just during a pandemic,” said Sanchez, 40.

Another rideshare driver, Marion Dollar, 50, said she decided to stop driving for two weeks to help prevent the spread of coronavirus. She said she can’t last more than a month without a paycheck.

“It’s very important to social distance,” Dollar said of her decision to stay inside at her Pilsen home. “We all have to work together for the benefit of everyone right now.”

That said, the Airbnb host has also seen her home bookings drop off a cliff since coronavirus exploded across the county.

“At least I have some savings. Those people who are working now, they probably have no other choice,” Dollar said.

Other rideshare drivers who spoke with the Sun-Times said they’ve seen their earnings plummet as events are canceled, bars are closed and airports have slowed to a crawl.

When those industries close, the effect on the wages of workers who support them are felt far and wide.

Alydar Skyy, a 30-year-old bartender and stand-up comic from Arlington Heights, said she’s effectively unemployed coming out of the already slow months of January and February.

Not only have her shifts been suspended, her stand-up gigs are canceled, too.

“I would have made about $400 this weekend,” she said of her comedy work.

Unplanned events

Shar Pazand, owner of Citygirl Events, said event planners, in addition to suffering huge losses from cancellations, have a daunting number of balls in the air as countless events are postponed or rescheduled.

A postponed wedding, for example, can impact up to 15 different vendors, from hotels to caterers to transportation companies to DJs. If an event is rescheduled, there is no guarantee the original vendors will be available. The uncertainty is the hardest part, she said.

“What this has proven to me is that we are all so connected,” Pazand said. For better or for worse, “we are all in this together.”

Temp worker can’t get unemployment

Canceled events have led to layoffs in workers in a host of jobs. Maria Morales, a mother of six who lives in Gage Park, was let go last week from her job with a cleaning crew at McCormick Place, when her boss called to say since no events were scheduled, there was no work for her.

Morales said she is not eligible for unemployment insurance, since her company pays her as a temporary worker.

“They told us we might not get work again until June,” she said from home Wednesday.

Her husband works mostly during the warmer months as a construction contractor. Morales recently got approved for food assistance, which was her biggest worry.

“Rent, yes. Bills, yes. But feeding my children” is her biggest worry, she said. “We’re living a decent life, but it’s hard for us. People need to put on our shoes and see how we struggle.”

Morales said any additional federal or state assistance would be a huge help to her and her family.

“They’re going to bail out the airlines, but what about us?” she wondered.

No homes to clean

Meanwhile, despite all the “deep cleaning” taking places at many businesses and other spaces, domestic workers who clean houses and apartments are actually seeing their work dry up as residents become fearful of letting outsiders into their homes.

Lety Tellez, an organizer with the Latino Union of Chicago, a nonprofit based in Albany Park, said the nearly 100 domestic workers — most of whom are immigrant women with children — in her group are “being left without work.”

Cecilia Garcia said she had four houses penciled in for this week, but they’ve all canceled.

“I have three for next week too, but I think those are going to get canceled, too,” she said of the jobs, which pay $100-$150 each.

Garcia’s husband, an auto mechanic, is also out of work.

“Everything’s paralyzed,” she said. “We can’t pay the bills if we’re not working.”

Multiple jobs, all impacted

Carolina Sanchez, like many workers interviewed by the Sun-Times, has two jobs to make ends meet. But what makes this situation so difficult is both of her sources of income are seriously threatened by the pandemic.

Sanchez, 28, works part-time at a vintage clothing store in Pilsen that has seen its business drop dramatically. She’s also a professional photographer, but her 15 photoshoots in March and April have all been canceled.

“My main concern right now is being safe, but if the store closes or if nothing happens with photography, I will most likely end up moving back in with my parents in Michigan,” she said.

Finding other ways to make money

Other impacted workers say they have been forced to find ways to recoup lost income or remodel their businesses to remain active.

David Rothstein, a bandleader who performs at corporate events and weddings, said many of his gigs have been canceled or postponed.

“We’ve lost some corporate events which many times don’t reschedule,” he said. “As time goes on and we get deeper into wedding season, then it starts to get even more challenging. It’s had a huge impact.”

He added: “It’s not one random wedding where the couple broke up. It’s affecting everything.”

To make up for lost income, some musicians he knows have started teaching music lessons using online video services. His own company is developing an option for video streaming services so that older family members who are more susceptible to coronavirus can still experience a wedding or event from a remote location.

“They only ones that are going to survive this are the ones who are going to adapt,” he said.",real

The Hawks canceled the 13th edition of the event — slated for July 24-26 — on Wednesday, citing the uncertain status of the rest of the 2019-20 NHL season and the advice of public-health officials. Full refunds for previously purchased convention passes and hotel rooms will be issued.

The 2019 convention drew thousands of fans to downtown Chicago for autograph sessions, meet-and-greets, new-player introductions, alumni and front-office panels and numerous other types of programming. It spanned from Friday night through Sunday afternoon, just as this edition was supposed to do.

Illinois’ ban on large gatherings — although it doesn’t extend anywhere near late July yet — theoretically would make the convention impossible. And even if the ban were to be lifted by then, many fans might be reluctant to attend, given the close proximity they would have with thousands of others, leading to attendance concerns.

There’s also a chance the NHL season will resume around that point of the summer, although a plethora of obstacles would lie in the way of that.

If the season does resume, the most likely way would seem to be in a single, neutral-site city, ideally one with relatively few coronavirus cases but with infrastructure sufficient enough to house thousands of players, coaches, league officials, TV crews and more. Even still, the games almost certainly would be held in empty arenas.

So far, cities reportedly under consideration are Grand Forks, North Dakota; Manchester, New Hampshire; and Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. Grand Forks is home to the University of North Dakota’s hockey facilities. Manchester’s SNHU Arena is the former home of a Kings minor-league affiliate. Saskatoon’s spacious SaskTel Centre typically hosts the Blades of the Western Hockey League.

But the NHL is far away from making any serious commitments to such sites, and little is known about what the format the end of the season would look like. Unless the regular season was resumed or the playoff field was expanded, the Hawks wouldn’t take part.",real
21,https://www.worldhealth.net/news/reducing-diagnostic-time-coronavirus/,2020-02-17,Reducing Diagnostic Time Of Coronavirus,"The coronavirus is showing no signs of slowing down, making it important to improve the current method of diagnosing it which can take an hour or longer. Now, a new technology based on a combination of optics and magnetic particles can test 100 samples and reduce the diagnostic time down to about 15 minutes.

Currently there are over 80 reported clinical trials running in China to test possible coronavirus treatments, and the first new case has been reported in Africa, prompting concern over the spread of the virus after arriving in countries that may be vulnerable due to economic status or political instability.

According to Dr. Amos Danielli of the Alexander Kofkin Faculty of Engineering at Bar-IIan University this new technology can carry out saliva test analysis within 15 minutes, and the technology has already been proven to reduce diagnostic time of Zika virus and it is being used in the Israel Ministry of Health’s central virology laboratory.

Danielli’s lab developed a technology for sensitive detection of virus specific RNA sequences by attaching the virus RNA to a fluorescent molecule that emits light when illuminated by a laser beam; at very low concentrations of RNA the signal emitted is so low that existing devices can’t detect it. Magnetic particles that have been added to the solution enable them to adhere to the fluorescent molecules which allows for a greater concentration of fluorescent molecules and more accurate measurement.

""If we think of the saliva of a corona patient filling an entire room, then this laser beam can be compared to the size of a fist and at low concentrations of virus RNA, there might be only 2-3 fluorescent molecules within that fist,"" explains Danielli.

""This development relies on the use of two small electromagnets, which are magnets powered by an electric current. By properly positioning them, we were able to create a strong magnetic field and collect all the thousands of fluorescent molecules from the entire solution and aggregate them inside the laser beam, thereby multiplying the signal strength by several orders of magnitude. But that's not all. Instead of pumping the solution we alternately operate the electromagnets, once on the left and once on the right, moving the molecules from side to side, in and out of the laser beam. As they pass through the laser beam they become illuminated. When they exit the light beam they are no longer illuminated. This flickering allows us, without any additional procedures, to accurately determine whether a person has been exposed to coronavirus,” said Danielli.

High sensitivity and ease of operation of the platform enables facilities to use this technology in point of care applications where resources are limited to provide doctors with an alternative method for accurate and rapid detection. The researchers are also collaborating with European universities to identify antibodies that the immune system may be producing against the coronavirus; and he is looking for investors to help accelerate his R&D of the kit to get it introduced into hospitals.

Co-founder Jeffrey Katzenberg attributes “everything that has gone wrong to coronavirus,” he told The New York Times in a new interview published on Monday. But Katzenberg is hopeful that rolling out new features will help, including giving subscribers the ability to share content from Quibi shows on social media.

When Quibi launched at the beginning of April, the app blocked sharing to platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and Reddit. Now, Katzenberg and the team are working on ways to ensure Quibi is “less walled off from the internet.” People will eventually be able to share Quibi content on social media, but there’s no estimated time frame for when that feature will become available.

(Disclosure: Vox Media is partnered with Quibi on two shows and there are discussions for a Verge show in the future.)

“There are a whole bunch of things we have now seen in the product that we thought we got mostly right,” Katzenberg said, “but now that there are hundreds of people on there using it, you go, ‘Uh-oh, we didn’t see that.’”

People also couldn’t take screenshots inside the app. Although that restriction isn’t unique to Quibi (Netflix and Disney Plus deal with the same problem in their mobile apps), without a desktop version of the app for people to watch Quibi shows on, the only way for people to share scenes was to use another phone to record the episode playing. So that’s what people did, managing in some cases to go viral. It’s unclear if people will be able to screenshot or if Quibi will allow direct sharing of clips from the app to various social media apps. The Verge has reached out for more information.

“There are a whole bunch of things we have now seen in the product that we thought we got mostly right”

Another feature coming to Quibi’s iOS app this week is the ability to stream shows and “movies-in-chapters” on TV screens. There’s no further explanation for how people will do this — considering the feature is rolling out to iOS first, the implication would be that it’s using AirPlay. Android users might have to wait a bit longer for Chromecast support. The bigger-screen experience was always part of the plan, but CEO Meg Whitman has admitted in the past that if they knew COVID-19 was going to happen, they might have launched with the feature.

It’s also unclear if or how the “turnstyle” technology — the bread-and-butter behind Quibi’s pitch to subscribers that orients videos based on how you hold your phone — will work if it’s playing on a television set, which cannot be rotated.

Right now, the goal seems to be getting more people talking about and watching Quibi: social media can help turn Quibi shows into viral memes (see: Netflix’s Tiger King), and allowing people to watch shows on their television gives subscribers another viewing choice. Quibi currently has about 3.5 million app downloads and 1.3 million active users, according to Katzenberg.

That’s a far cry from Disney Plus’ nearly 55 million subscribers and YouTube’s more than 2 billion monthly users, 70 percent of which use the app on their phone. Quibi isn’t available globally (like YouTube) and doesn’t have a library of popular intellectual property (like Disney), which makes growth more difficult.

Its shows haven’t received positive reviews, and interest in the streaming service has plummeted since its initial launch on April 6th. Comparatively, most other streaming services have seen an uptick in views. People don’t seem interested in Quibi, and that’s the issue Katzenberg is trying to fix. Whether the novel coronavirus is entirely to blame, as Katzenberg suggested, is questionable. Industry insiders argued before Quibi’s launch that it would be difficult trying to sell a product in a highly competitive market that didn’t seem like it was particularly needed.

But Katzenberg acknowledged the team is far from happy with the results. “Is it the avalanche of people that we wanted and were going for out of launch?” Katzenberg told the Times. “The answer is no. It’s not up to what we wanted. It’s not close to what we wanted.”",real

(Center for Pharmaceutical Research via The New York Times)

In a medical research project nearly unrivaled in its ambition and scope, volunteers worldwide are rolling up their sleeves to receive experimental vaccines against the coronavirus — only months after the virus was identified.

Companies like Inovio and Pfizer have begun early tests of candidates in people to determine whether their vaccines are safe. Researchers at the University of Oxford in England are testing vaccines in human subjects, too, and say they could have one ready for emergency use as soon as September.

Moderna on Monday announced encouraging results of a safety trial of its vaccine in eight volunteers. There were no published data, but the news alone sent hopes soaring.

Animal studies have raised expectations, too. Researchers at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center on Wednesday published research showing that a prototype vaccine effectively protected monkeys from infection with the virus.

The findings will pave the way to the development of a human vaccine, said the investigators. They have already partnered with Janssen, a division of Johnson & Johnson.

In labs around the world, there is now cautious optimism that a coronavirus vaccine, and perhaps more than one, will be ready sometime next year.

Scientists are exploring not just one approach to creating the vaccine but at least four. So great is the urgency that they are combining trial phases and shortening a process that usually takes years, sometimes more than a decade.

The coronavirus itself has turned out to be clumsy prey, a stable pathogen unlikely to mutate significantly and dodge a vaccine.

“It’s an easier target, which is terrific news,” said Michael Farzan, a virologist at Scripps Research in Jupiter, Florida.

An effective vaccine will be crucial to ending the pandemic, which has sickened at least 4.7 million worldwide and killed at least 318,000. Widespread immunity would reopen the door to lives without social distancing and face masks.

“What people don’t realize is that normally vaccine development takes many years, sometimes decades,” said Dr. Dan Barouch, a virologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston who led the monkey trials. “And so trying to compress the whole vaccine process into 12 to 18 months is really unheard-of. If that happens, it will be the fastest vaccine development program ever in history.”

More than 100 research teams around the world are taking aim at the virus from multiple angles.

Moderna’s vaccine is based on a relatively new mRNA technology that delivers bits of the virus’s genes into human cells. The goal is for cells to begin making a viral protein that the immune system recognizes as foreign. The body builds defenses against that protein, priming itself to attack if the actual coronavirus invades.

Some vaccine-makers, including Inovio, are developing vaccines based on DNA variations of this approach.

But the technology used by both companies has never produced a vaccine approved for clinical use, let alone one that can be made in industrial quantities. Moderna was criticized for making rosy predictions, based on a handful of patients, without providing any scientific data.

Other research teams have turned to more traditional strategies.

Some scientists are using harmless viruses to deliver coronavirus genes into cells, forcing them to produce proteins that may teach the immune system to watch out for the coronavirus. CanSino Biologics, a company in China, has begun human testing of a coronavirus vaccine that relies on this approach, as has the University of Oxford team.

Other traditional approaches rely on fragments of a coronavirus protein to make a vaccine, while some use killed, or inactivated, versions of the whole coronavirus. In China, such vaccines have already entered human trials.

Florian Krammer, a virologist at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, predicted that at least 20 additional vaccine candidates will make their way into clinical trials in the weeks to come.

“I’m not worried at all about it,” he said of the prospects for a new vaccine.

Many of these vaccines will stumble as the trials progress. As more people are inoculated, some candidates will fail to protect against the virus, and side effects will become more apparent.

But from what scientists are learning about the coronavirus, it ought to be a relatively easy target.",real

But Levin has an idea about when he thinks it needs to restart.

“A lot of our teams want to play; they do want to play,” Levin told the Sun-Times. “The question is, can they play? If May 1 turns out to be a hard date, maybe we can. If it gets pushed any past that, I think probably not.”

Like the rest of the North American sports world, the Wolves and the AHL are waiting for their next steps. They’re watching to see how the COVID-19 pandemic plays out and whether it will dissipate enough to allow the season to come back. And if it does return, how it would look is uncertain.

The ECHL already has canceled its season. And on Monday, the AHL announced its indefinite suspension won’t be lifted before May.

In most cases, the criteria for games wouldn’t be complicated. It is now.

“Something that says groups can get together again,” Levin said. “That’s going to have to happen. Nobody knows when that’s going to happen.”

Unlike the NBA, Major League Baseball and NHL, AHL teams can’t rely on media-rights fees to help them avoid substantial losses through a period without games. The Wolves lost three games last weekend and are dropping at least five more home dates at Allstate Arena.

Levin didn’t say how much that hit the Wolves, but he admitted the three games were “a lot of money.”

“I haven’t looked at the economic impact, really, but that’s not really where I’m at right now,” Levin said. “I’m just worried about other people and the situation going on around here.”

For the Wolves, that means anybody who can is working remotely. The players have left, and Levin said AHL teams have been advised they can melt the ice in their buildings. As of Tuesday, however, the Wolves hadn’t.

The Wolves also are processing refunds for people who had bought tickets, but that’s not easy because of the circumstances.

“We’re just in a holding pattern,” Levin said. “We’ve got to get money back to people and groups that bought tickets. There’s a lot of things that have to happen. It’s going to take a little time getting organized. Frankly, we’re short-handed because we don’t want to have everybody working in the same area.”

There is also the business of hockey to attend to. For the Wolves, that means finalizing a new parent club for next year. Levin sounded excited about the future, though he didn’t divulge which teams he had spoken with about a potential partnership.

That, after all, isn’t the priority these days.

“Obviously, these people have other concerns at the moment,” Levin said. “Their NHL teams are down. Their buildings are down. You can’t call them and say, ‘Hey, do you want to talk about this right now?’ I don’t think it’s the most important thing on their minds.

“We’re just going to wait and see. That’s all we can do.”",real

The donation is made possible through the ASJ and its subsidiary project “Time Done,” which aims to knock down legal barriers that previously incarcerated people often face such as access to housing, education and employment.

As of this week, seven detainees of the jail have died after testing positive for COVID-19, according to the Cook County Sheriff’s office. In addition, 236 detainees have tested positive for the virus, with six receiving treatment at hospitals. Another 291 detainees are no longer considered positive for COVID and are being monitored at the jail’s recovery facility, the sheriff’s office said.

Two corrections officers and a court deputy at the facility died earlier this week.

“The conditions in jails and prisons are ripe for spreading coronavirus within them and into communities,” said Robert Rooks, co-founder and CEO of Alliance for Safety and Justice, in a statement. “There have been important efforts to reduce the population at Cook County Jail, yet we wanted to provide support to protect people inside of the facility while also recognizing there is more to be done. There are ways to safely reduce incarceration that are critical to prevent any further spread of COVID-19.”

G Herbo isn’t the only Chicago hip-hop luminary who’s giving back to a community in a time of need.

Earlier this week, activist and rapper Common called attention to how the pandemic poses a health risk to millions of incarcerated people in the U.S. via his criminal justice reform organization Imagine Justice in a campaign dubbed #WeMatterToo.

1796,https://www.politico.eu/article/france-elections-philippe-macron-coronavirus/,2020-05-22,France sets date for second round of local elections,"Presidential reelection campaigns are generally referendums on the incumbent. A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump’s measures of success. But after a manic 3½ years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.

By far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. “I’m not going to play that game,” said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. “I think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they’re not uniform across states and across countries.”

But even beyond the death count, there’s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. “I’m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,” the official said.

Some Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn’t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn’t been able to focus on getting the response right.

Trump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. “So it is a war and I define victory when it’s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,” he said on May 1. “It can never be a total victory because too many people have died.”

When American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn’t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush’s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.

Others are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. “Allowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,” argued one Republican close to the president.

“The closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.” Sen. Lindsey Graham

But, he added, “If things don’t look like they’re bouncing back by September, I think that’s going to be a problem.”

The fear that Trump can’t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.

When asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump’s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the “economic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.”

A spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.

Others are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)",real
377,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/20/world/coronavirus-cases-news.html,2020-04-20,Coronavirus Death Toll Soars in Turkey; W.H.O. Warns of Vaccine Roadblock,"
This briefing has ended. Read the latest developments in the coronavirus pandemic here.
Istanbul deaths suggest a wider outbreak than Turkey admits.Turkey has surpassed China in its number of confirmed coronavirus cases, as the tally rose to more than 90,000 by Monday, with deaths reaching at least 2,140, according to official government figures. But the true death toll may be much higher.
Data compiled by The New York Times from records of deaths in Istanbul indicate that Turkey is grappling with a far bigger calamity from the coronavirus than official figures and statements indicate. The city alone recorded about 2,100 more deaths than expected from March 9 to April 12, based on weekly averages from the last two years, far more than officials reported for the whole of Turkey during that time.
While not all those deaths are necessarily directly attributable to the coronavirus, the numbers indicate a striking jump in fatalities that has coincided with the onset of the outbreak, a preliminary indicator that is being used by researchers to cut through the fog of the pandemic and assess its full toll in real time.
The government maintains that it acted swiftly, stopping flights and border crossings from five of the most affected countries in February and closing schools, restaurants and bars in mid-March when the first case of infection was confirmed.
But by then, the statistics compiled by The Times show, the damage was done. And medical professionals say that Turkey did not do enough to halt international travelers, and neglected contact tracing and community care.
“In February, they did nothing, although it was known the disease was there,” Dr. Sinan Adiyaman, head of the Turkish Medical Association, said in an interview.
The government announced its first death from Covid-19 on March 17. But the statistics compiled by The Times suggest that even around that time, the number of deaths overall in Istanbul was already considerably higher than historical averages, an indication that the virus had arrived several weeks earlier.
Any death statistics in the midst of a pandemic are tricky to pin down and must be considered preliminary. Many European countries are engaged in trying to improve their death statistics, which they now acknowledge are incomplete.
There are many hurdles to developing and widely distributing a vaccine, a W.H.O. official warned.
The head of the World Health Organization’s emergencies program warned on Monday that even if a vaccine against the coronavirus were quickly developed, manufacturing and distributing it could prove extraordinarily difficult.
There is no approved treatment for or vaccine against infection with the coronavirus. More than two dozen companies have announced vaccine programs; at least three candidates already are in human trials.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has warned that a vaccine is at least 18 months away. Other experts say even that timeline is optimistic.
The development process is important, but manufacturers must begin planning to scale up manufacturing capacities to meet global demand when a successful vaccine is discovered, said Dr. Michael Ryan, head of the W.H.O.’s emergencies program.
Billions of people around the globe eventually may need vaccination. Modern vaccines, made with DNA and RNA, require specialized facilities; it is not clear who could make them.
And it will be important that vaccines go where they are most needed, not simply to the countries that can afford them. The W.H.O. is working with government leaders and nonprofits like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations to ensure that means for equitable vaccine distribution are in place when the time comes, Dr. Ryan said.
“We’ve worked for over 20 years trying to ensure that products like vaccines are distributed in emergencies on the basis of epidemiological need,” Dr. Ryan said at a news briefing. “We intend to do exactly the same here.”
The agency has a long history of distributing vaccines to countries in need, including the meningitis, yellow fever, cholera and polio vaccines. Yet mass vaccination campaigns are still logistically difficult and often met with resistance in the community.
“As a global health architecture, we’re not very good at delivering vaccines in people other than children — in adults,” Dr. Ryan said.
“If this is to work, it will require one of the greatest scientific, one of the greatest political, one of the greatest financial, one of the greatest public health operations in a generation,” he added.
Germany cautiously restarts its economy, allowing small shops to open.
Across Germany, smaller stores were allowed to open their doors on Monday for the first time in nearly a month, under initial measures to ease restrictions imposed in March as the coronavirus outbreak took hold. Germans are still required to stay at least five feet from one another at all times until the end of April.
“We must not allow ourselves to be lulled into a false sense of security,” Chancellor Angela Merkel said at a news conference on Monday, warning that the consequences of the new measures would be visible only in two weeks’ time. “That is what makes the situation so difficult.”
Norway, the Czech Republic and Denmark, all lifted some restrictions on Monday, attempting to balance public health against economic revival. Across Europe, the confirmed coronavirus toll passed one million infections and 100,000 deaths, according to the European Center for Disease Control.
Rana Basar reopened her jewelry and accessories shop in the normally bustling Ottensen shopping district of Hamburg on Monday, but said it had been a quiet start.
“It is not like people are in the mood to go shopping,” she added.She prepared her store, Junajoux, with disinfectant and markings on the floor to help the two to three customers allowed in at a time to keep the required distance, as well as a mask to wear when customers are present. One of the biggest challenges, she said, was organizing care for her two children, because schools remain closed.
“A lot of this has not been fully thought through,” Ms. Basar said.In Rostock, where the local zoo was one of several in the country allowed to reopen, around 1,000 people — roughly half of normal numbers — were expected to visit the animals that could be viewed from outside, as indoor exhibits remained closed. All large gatherings have been banned until the end of summer.
Germany has recorded 141,672 coronavirus cases, with 4,404 fatalities, but the rate of infection has been steadily slowing in recent days and the country’s health system has been able to cope with the strain.
The latest in science: Six feet between tables may not be enough distance to safely reopen restaurants.
In January, at a restaurant in Guangzhou, China, one diner infected with the novel coronavirus but not yet feeling sick appeared to have spread the disease to nine other people. One of the restaurant’s air-conditioners apparently blew the virus particles around the dining room.
There were 73 other diners who ate that day on the same floor of the five-story restaurant, and the good news is they did not become sick. Neither did the eight employees who were working on the floor at the time.
Chinese researchers described the incident in a paper that is to be published in the July issue of the Emerging Infectious Diseases, a journal published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The field study has limitations. The researchers, for example, did not perform experiments to simulate the airborne transmission.
That outbreak illustrates some of the challenges that restaurants will face when they try to reopen. Ventilation systems can create complex patterns of air flow and keep viruses aloft, so simply spacing tables six feet apart — the minimum distance that the C.D.C. advises you keep from other people — may not be sufficient to safeguard restaurant patrons.
The social nature of dining out could increase the risk. The longer people linger in a contaminated area, the more virus particles they would likely inhale. Eating is also one activity that cannot be accomplished while wearing a mask. Virus-laden droplets can be expelled into the air through breathing and talking, not just through coughs and sneezes.
On the other hand, all of the people who became sick at the restaurant in China were either at the same table as the infected person or at one of two neighboring tables. The fact that people farther away remained healthy is a hopeful hint that the coronavirus is primarily transmitted through larger respiratory droplets, which fall out of the air more quickly than smaller droplets known as aerosols, which can float for hours.
Filipino nurses work the front lines in foreign lands.
Each year about 13,000 nurses leave the Philippines for jobs in wealthier countries, sending money back home, often living in bare-bones conditions, far from familiar places and people.
Covid-19 has required them to make an additional sacrifice: risking their health and their lives  by caring for the sick. In places with major coronavirus outbreaks, nurses and doctors working in hospitals have been among the people most likely to become infected.
The virus has killed at least seven Filipino employees of Britain’s National Health Service, and in the United States it has claimed the lives of at least five nurses and a doctor from the Philippines.
The threat is as real as can be to Jhoanna Mariel Buendia, 27, a nurse who treats Covid-19 patients in the intensive care unit of a hospital in York, England.
Last month, her aunt, Araceli Buendia Ilagan, 63, an associate supervisor in the cardiac surgical intensive care unit of a hospital in Miami, died of the disease. An uncle, a nurse in California, is hospitalized with the virus.
Ms. Buendia is one of four nurses from the Philippines sharing a house in York.“The common denominator is that we’re all scared,” she said.
Western countries rely heavily on health care workers from other parts of the world — about one-sixth of the nurses working in the United States are immigrants — and even with that recruitment, there are labor shortages. The Philippines produce particularly large numbers of nurses.
In response to the pandemic, the Philippine government has temporarily barred health workers from leaving the country, saying that going abroad would put them at risk, and that they were needed at home.
As new U.S. hotspots emerge and Washington stays at an impasse, governors grapple with reopening.
As Massachusetts and some prisons become hotspots of the coronavirus outbreak in the United States, President Trump and Democratic lawmakers remained deadlocked on Monday over a bill to keep paychecks flowing to small business employees.
More evidence emerged that New York, the hardest-hit state, had reached a plateau — a tragically high one — as Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo reported 478 more Covid-19 deaths, the lowest one-day figure in more than two weeks. (The state’s total of more than 14,000 deaths does not count what New York City says are 3,700 presumed Covid-19 deaths among people who were never tested for the virus.)
In some parts of the country, the virus continues to spread quickly. Massachusetts now has the third-most confirmed infections of any state, with more than 38,000, and the fourth-most deaths, with more than 1,700.
A New York Times analysis shows that four of the country’s 10 largest sources of new infections are prisons or jails. An Ohio state prison is the biggest source, with 1,828 inmates and 103 employees infected.
More than 770,000 people nationwide have tested positive for the novel coronavirus and more than 37,000 have died, according to data collected by The Times — and experts say the true figures are likely much higher.
New York offered a small suggestion of good news on Monday, starting a program to test people for coronavirus antibodies. The accuracy of the testing remains in question, but if successful, it could indicate how many people have some immunity and who they are, which are important steps toward jumpstarting the economy.
 Singapore seemed to have coronavirus under control. Then cases doubled.
After recording its first coronavirus case on Jan. 23, Singapore did almost everything right.The prosperous city-state traced the close contacts of every infected patient, shut the borders to populations likely to carry the contagion, and provided free testing and treatment.
But over the past few days, Singapore’s caseload has more than doubled, with more than 8,000 cases confirmed as of Monday, the highest in Southeast Asia. Most of the new infections are within crowded dormitories where low-paid migrant laborers from South Asia and China live, unnoticed by many of the country’s richer residents and, it turns out, the government itself.
The group proved a major blind spot in the coronavirus pandemic, exposing the starkly different experiences of rich expatriates and poorer ones in a city-state where 40 percent of residents are foreign born.
Most of the cases among migrant workers are mild or asymptomatic, and none have required critical care, perhaps explaining why the dormitory outbreaks at first went unnoticed. In total, 11 people in Singapore have died of Covid-19, a relatively low fatality rate.
Tens of thousands of Singaporeans have donated funds for the well-being of migrant workers, and the expectation is that the government will deliver on its vow to treat them better. For now, though, the country is reeling from the pandemic’s assault on some of its most defenseless people.
Iran eases restrictions on some businesses.
Iran continued its gradual rebooting of its economy on Monday by reopening traditional bazaars and modern shopping malls and lifting travel restrictions around the country.
The government has called its plan “smart distancing,” rather than the strict social distancing measures imposed by most other countries hoping to flatten the rate of infection as they fight the coronavirus pandemic. But not much distancing was observed as commuters packed trains and buses and shoppers crowded the narrow, winding passageways that shape Tehran’s traditional bazaar.
President Hassan Rouhani of Iran said he was considering opening religious shrines, a potential vector for spreading the virus, two weeks earlier than scheduled based on requests from custodians of the religious centers.
Health officials in the country, one of the first outside China to be hit hard by the virus, continued to warn that another surge of patients and deaths was inevitable. Different branches of the government sent conflicting messages to the public about the pros and cons of easing restrictions while the contagion had not been contained, testing was not widely available and the numbers of patients and deaths continued to surge.
“Contact among the public has increased with the opening of shopping centers and people moving around on public transportation,” said Alireza Zali, the head of Iran’s coronavirus relief committee. There has been a steady increase in people contracting the virus and being hospitalized, Mr. Zali said, including a 2 percent increase in patients being admitted to intensive care units within the past 24 hours.
The health ministry said on Monday that 1,294 new cases were reported in the past 24 hours and that 91 people had died. Iran’s official tally stands at 5,209 people dead and 83,505 infected.
Oil prices nosedived as the worldwide surplus grew.
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday over growing concerns that the collapse in demand has far outstripped attempts to curb production and store the excess supply.
The price of the main U.S. benchmark, West Texas Intermediate, actually fell below zero — meaning that some sellers, fearing they would be unable to sell the oil and would have no place to put it, were willing to pay people to take it.
That stunning drop was largely a short-term aberration driven by the timing of futures contracts, but it highlighted the underlying severe damage to oil markets from the worldwide glut.
Other oil prices, less affected by futures, also fell, but not as drastically. Brent crude, an international benchmark, dropped more than 6 percent, below $27 a barrel — less than half its price two months ago.
[Analysis: Oil collapse and covid-19 create toxic geopolitical stew.]Stocks slumped, as well, with the S&P 500 index losing 1.8 percent on the day.
With much of the world in lockdown because of the pandemic, global demand for oil has collapsed, leading to record surpluses.
On April 12, major exporters like Saudi Arabia and Russia agreed to cut production by 9.7 million barrels a day, beginning in May, but that was not nearly enough to compensate for the drop in demand. Analysts estimate that consumption in April will have fallen by three times that amount.
At the same time, oil storage tanks in the United States, especially in the crucial site of Cushing, Okla., are nearing their limits.
As a result, investors have little interest in bidding in the current round of West Texas Intermediate futures trading, which expires on Tuesday, for delivery of oil in May. Under those futures contracts, the crude is delivered to Cushing, but investors are worried that there will be no room to store it there.
The next futures contract for West Texas Intermediate, for delivery in June, fell about 12 percent on Monday, to around $22 a barrel.
Iraq begins to lift restrictions.
Iraqis will join a growing list of nations that are starting to lift restrictions as they continue fighting the coronavirus.
 The Iraqi government decided Monday to loosen a curfew it has had in place for nearly five weeks. It will allow some government employees to return to work and also some private sector workers, including those working in clothing stores and on construction sites.
Iraqis will be allowed to leave their home and neighborhoods from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. for work or for buying food or going to pharmacies or medical appointments.
“Those who are carpenters, blacksmiths, car mechanics, barbers and others are permitted to work during the day as long as no more than three people are in the establishment at one time,” the official order said. Electricians and computer store workers are also included.
Mosques will remain closed and so will restaurants, sporting events and cinemas. Iraq has a relatively low number of cases, 1,574 as of April 20, and 82 deaths.
Iran, which shares a 1,000 mile border with Iraq, has also begun a gradual return to normal life.Russians in the Caucasus mountains march shoulder-to-shoulder to protest lockdown measures.In scenes reminiscent of anti-lockdown protests last week in Michigan and Wisconsin, hundreds of Russians took to the streets of a city in the Caucasus mountains on Monday demanding the resignation of the local governor and the lifting of his stay-at-home order.
The protest in Vladikavkaz, the capital of North Ossetia, was organized by political opponents of the governor, Vyacheslav Bitarov, a Kremlin ally who was appointed to his post by President Vladimir V. Putin in 2016.
Unlike President Trump, Mr. Putin has urged citizens to obey quarantine restrictions and show “discipline and responsibility” in managing an outbreak that he described on Sunday as “under total control” but still not at its peak in Russia.
A mainly Christian pocket in a largely Muslim region, North Ossetia has a long record of loyalty to Moscow, which it looks to for protection and funding. The pandemic, however, has scrambled allegiances and political calculations.
Videos on social media showed people marching shoulder-to-shoulder in Vladikavkaz, in violation of social distancing recommendations backed by the Kremlin. They chanted slogans against the regional government and called on Mr. Bitarov to resign.
As has happened in other countries, anger at business closures and restrictions on movement has fed pre-existing political feuds and rage over corruption. Mr. Bitarov’s demands that people stay home caused fury amid reports that a brewery he owns has been exempted from the lockdown.
Among those supporting the protest was Vadim Cheldiev, a prominent coronavirus skeptic who has dismissed the pandemic as a hoax. In a video posted online on Monday, he said coronavirus “doesn’t exist” but was a pretext to “establish total control over us all.”
OVD Info, a Russian group that monitors arrests, reported that the police detained two suspected organizers of the demonstration, along with several protesters. Officers in riot gear cordoned off government buildings in the city center and drove a crowd of demonstrators from a central square.
Russian news outlets blamed the protest on supporters of Vitaly Kaloev, an infamous former businessman and member of the regional council. Mr. Kaloev was jailed in Switzerland in 2004 for the murder of a Swiss air traffic controller whom he blamed for a plane crash that killed his wife and children.
Released from prison after just three years following intense lobbying by Moscow, Mr. Kaloev returned to a hero’s welcome in North Ossetia, but has bridled in recent years at being passed over by the Kremlin in favor of Mr. Bitarov.
At some hospitals in Israel, relatives can visit dying Covid-19 patients.
Several Israeli hospitals have begun to allow deathbed visits by family members of coronavirus patients, breaking with the strict ban that is in place across much of the world.
Proponents say that one or two relatives making short bedside visits while clothed head-to-toe in protective gear is manageable for hospital workers, and that the benefits outweigh the costs.
Ronni Gamza, chief executive of Tel Aviv’s Sourasky Medical Center, said his hospital had adhered to the “default position” of barring all family visits to the coronavirus ward, but said it was over-the-top and, in his view, inhumane.
“We had anxiety, narrow thinking, a little bit of hysteria, and we were too conservative,” he said. Israel’s hospitals have not been overrun like those in some countries, and the new visitation policy has been embraced by several major Israeli hospitals including Sheba Medical Center in Tel Hashomer, and Shaare Tzedek and Hadassah hospitals in Jerusalem.
Family visits, Dr. Gamzu said, require “less than one percent” of all the personal protective equipment his hospital uses. At peaks in the numbers of critical patients, Dr. Gamzu said, “You could say, ‘We are sorry, we do not have the capacity now.’ But to take that as a standard?”
Dr. Gamzu said he was urging Israeli health authorities to open nursing homes up for visits as well.
Elisheva Stern was one of the first relatives given the chance to visit a dying patient, when she came to her father’s bedside earlier this month. “None of us want to say bye to our family,” she said. “But it’s really a gift.”

Luis Sepúlveda, a Chilean writer whose stay among Indigenous people in the Amazon led to his most celebrated novel and who was jailed during the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, died April 16 in Oviedo, Spain. He was 70.
The cause was the novel coronavirus, according to Tusquets, his publishing house in Barcelona. Mr. Sepúlveda, who was hospitalized in February, was among the first wave of people in Spain to be diagnosed.
Mr. Sepúlveda published several novels, children’s stories and travel books, and he also wrote and directed films. He acquired fame with his novel “The Old Man Who Read Love Stories” (1988), which tells the story of a man who, together with his wife, leaves his mountain village to take part in the colonization of the Amazon.
The book was inspired by Mr. Sepúlveda’s stay in the 1970s with the region’s Shuar Indigenous people. A review in The New York Times by David Unger compared it to one of the early works of Gabriel García Márquez.
“In its simple language and philosophical underpinnings, it is magical, thanks to the author’s skill at describing jungle life,” Mr. Unger wrote. Mr. Sepúlveda wrote the screenplay for a 2001 movie version starring Richard Dreyfuss.
Spain’s outbreak is easing, but its economic woes are just beginning.
Spain said on Monday that 399 people had died from the coronavirus in the previous 24 hours, the smallest daily percentage increase since a lockdown was imposed in mid-March, up just 1.9 percent up from the previous day. The number of people discharged from hospital is continuing to rise, now surpassing 80,000 recoveries, another sign of improvement.
But another report released on Monday was far less heartening: The country’s central bank warned that the Spanish economy could shrink as much as 13.6 percent this year. It also said that unemployment could rise to almost 22 percent, even excluding the thousands of workers whose contracts have been temporarily suspended under a government program designed to avoid mass layoffs. Spain’s jobless rate was almost 14 percent in February, before the outbreak took hold.
Spain’s restrictions on movement have been some of the strictest in Europe, including orders to keep children inside. A nationwide lockdown has been extended into May, but the government has started rolling back some limits, allowing construction sites and factories to reopen.
Italy, like Spain, is moving carefully toward restoring economic activity, while Britain and France have signaled that they will not relax restrictions until next month.
The restrictions on Spain’s children are set to be loosened starting April 27, though the government has not given details on the changes. Fernando Simón, the director of the national center for health emergencies, said on Monday that it was important to clarify that “children will be able to get out on the street, but it will not be a free exit, to play.”
He added: “It’s not about opening the door and having the neighbors come out.”As it considers reopening the economy, Spain is struggling to recount its dead. The latest figures from the Health Ministry do not match recent adjustments in regions that have taken into account data from funeral homes.
Djokovic would prefer not to get vaccinated to resume playing, but doesn’t rule it out.
Novak Djokovic, the world’s top ranked men’s tennis player, said on Sunday that he would have a difficult decision to make if receiving a coronavirus vaccine became a mandatory condition for competing on the circuit when play resumes.
“Personally I am opposed to vaccination and I wouldn’t want to be forced by someone to take a vaccine in order to be able to travel,” Djokovic said in comments reported and translated by Reuters. “But if it becomes compulsory, what will happen? I will have to make a decision. I have my own thoughts about the matter and whether those thoughts will change at some point, I don’t know.”
Djokovic, the 32-year-old Serbian star who has won 17 Grand Slam singles titles, was speaking with a group of Serbian players on a live Facebook chat when he made the comment. Djokovic is staying in Spain with his wife Jelena and their two children during the lockdown.
In a statement released on Monday through his management team, he declined to say whether he opposed vaccines in general. He made it clear he was intent on exploring other options, but did not rule vaccination out if it became compulsory.
The professional tennis tour has been shut down because of the virus since early March and will resume no sooner than July 13. Wimbledon has been canceled for the first time since 1945 and dozens of tournaments, including the French Open, which was scheduled to be the next Grand Slam tournament, have been postponed.
Wuhan lab rejects U.S. accusation that it was source of outbreak.
The Trump administration suggested that a Chinese laboratory may have been the source of the coronavirus outbreak, but a senior scientist at the lab in question has rejected the accusations, saying there are no signs that the virus was the product of human tampering.
The scientist, Yuan Zhiming, the director of a high-security virus research lab that is part of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, pushed back against the surge of speculation that the lab may have accidentally leaked the virus or was part of a conspiracy to release it.
“Without any evidence, and without any relationship to logic, he makes these allegations that are totally founded on speculation,” Mr. Yuan said of Senator Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican who was an early proponent of the theory that the lab was the origin of the virus.
“I’ve long engaged in biosecurity management and project management in laboratories, and I know this would have been impossible,” Mr. Yuan said in an interview aired over the weekend by CGTN, the Chinese television broadcaster.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last week that the Chinese government “needs to come clean” about the lab, and President Trump has kept the speculation alive, telling reporters that “more and more we’re hearing the story.”
But most scientists have dismissed the idea that the laboratory, built with French assistance, could have been the incubator, even inadvertently, of the new coronavirus. The French government has also said that there was no evidence of a link between the coronavirus and the lab.
But Mr. Yuan also ruefully suggested that no denial would halt the suspicions. “I’m also sure that as long as the outbreak continues, especially abroad, these suspicions or discordant voices will never disappear,” he said.
After second wave of infection, Hong Kong has first day with no new cases.
Hong Kong reported no new coronavirus cases on Monday, the first time since a second wave of imported infections hit the semiautonomous Chinese city in early March that there were no new daily infections.
The city has recorded 1,026 cases and four deaths since January, but cases tripled after residents returned to the city from hot spots in the United States and Europe last month. Hong Kong closed its borders to all nonresidents and shut gyms, movie theaters and government offices, and residents returning to the city are tested before they are allowed to return home for two weeks of self isolation. Fewer than 10 new cases were reported in more than a week.
The government also announced on Monday that residents returning to the city on late afternoon or evening flights would be required to stay overnight at a designated hotel until they are able to receive test results the following day.
Medical experts warned that the city would have to record at least two incubation periods — or 28 days — before they could rule out further outbreaks, adding that many carriers of the disease do not show symptoms or fall ill.
Despite the downward trend in transmissions, social distancing restrictions are still in place in Hong Kong. Schools have been closed since late January, and final exams that normally take place in late April were canceled. Government offices, gyms and movie theaters remain closed, and gatherings of more than four people are banned.
Australia and New Zealand ease lockdowns as new infections drop.
Australia and New Zealand announced plans on Monday to ease lockdown restrictions as both countries have managed so far to control coronavirus outbreaks, reporting  just a few new infections each day.
Careful and calibrated, the plans include a return to school for some children in the coming weeks as well as allowances for slightly more business activity, more freedom to exercise outdoors and the potential for gatherings of more than two people.
In Sydney, a few beaches reopened for exercise on Monday, leading to the return of surfers. In Maroubra, a coastal southern suburb, lifeguards used megaphones to warn surfers, runners and swimmers to stay physically distanced.
Many who ventured out expressed relief and awe at what the past month had brought. “I’m just kind of laughing,” said Paul Beswich, 55, one of many residents who welcomed the chance to go for a swim. “I’ve lived here all my life, and we’ve always been told that if you’ve got a virus, go flush it out in the water. Now we can.”
Australia and New Zealand have benefited from an early, aggressive response to the pandemic. In Australia, public health laboratories started building test kits in January.
As of Monday, the country had tested more than 422,000 people, and confirmed 6,619 confirmed and 71 deaths. None of its hospitals are overwhelmed. For eight straight days, the country has recorded fewer than 50 new cases, after a daily peak of nearly 500 on March 28. That was roughly when the government asked people to stay home, with the exception of essential activities, including shopping and exercise.
New Zealand’s restrictions were more severe, with Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announcing a total lockdown on March 25, asking New Zealanders to act as if they had the virus. The restrictions produced a result roughly in line with Australia’s. New Zealand has recorded just over 1,100 infections and 12 deaths after conducting 85,000 tests from a population of nearly 4.9 million.
Starting next Monday, it will begin to allow slightly more activity. Construction will be allowed to restart. Schools will reopen as of April 28 to some students, and funerals and weddings of up to 10 people could be allowed.
“Stay strong, stay home, be kind, and let’s finish what we started,” Ms. Ardern said on Monday.
U.S. ambassador in Kenya ignites outrage over virus criticism.
Comments from the top United States diplomat in Kenya have caused an uproar after he said that only a small part of the country’s population was adhering to rules aimed at curbing the spread of the coronavirus.
In a Twitter post on Sunday, the ambassador, Kyle McCarter, wrote, “Only a fraction of the wananchi are wearing masks and social distancing,” using the Swahili word for citizens.
“None of us know the magnitude of this Wuhan flu,” he continued, “but we must take basic known wise precautions. It is only for a short time.”
The comment sparked outrage, with some noting that social distancing was an unimaginable luxury for poor people living in overcrowded and cramped conditions. Others also questioned how he came to his conclusion given that Nairobi was on partial lockdown and movement in and out of the city was banned. Mr. McCarter doubled down writing in a follow-up post, “The further you get from Nairobi the less compliance there is. Trust me.”
When Twitter user Allan Ogera questioned him on the number of masks the United States has donated to Kenya, Mr. McCarter retorted, “You would not be able to test in Kenya if not for USA marafiki,” which means ‘friends’ in Swahili.
Some social media users also criticized the ambassador’s decision to call the coronavirus “Wuhan flu,” saying he was “trying to please” President Trump who nominated him for the post in 2019 and who has insisted on calling the coronavirus the “Chinese virus.” The disease is thought to have first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.
Kenya has 270 confirmed coronavirus cases, according to the latest figures, and a total of 14 deaths. To curb the spread of the virus, authorities have mandated the wearing of masks, imposed a nationwide dusk to dawn curfew, closed the biggest shopping district in the capital  and introduced partial lockdowns in four out of the country’s 47 counties.
Thousands who died in Italy’s nursing homes were not counted among fatalities.
The coronavirus outbreak tore through communities in northern Italy and overwhelmed the health care system with such force that only now is the true scale of the outbreak beginning to emerge. Like other hard-hit countries, including China and Spain, Italy has had to revisit its tally of the dead.
Health experts in Italy say they now believe thousands of nursing home residents were initially unaccounted for. A recent survey by Italy’s national health institute estimated that 40.2 percent of the 6,773 people who died in Italian nursing homes between Feb 1 and April 14  had either a confirmed case of Covid-19 or symptoms consistent with the infection.
“We observed that most deaths occurred in the second half of March, at the peak of the Covid infection, while some of the earlier deaths coincided with the influenza season,” said Graziano Onder, director of the Aging Department at the National Health Institute, which presented the data on Friday. Only the 364 nursing home residents who had tested positive were included in the official toll kept by the country’s Civil Protection Department.
The actual number of Covid-19 deaths in these nursing homes may never be known because initially testing was infrequent.
“Because the swabs were so difficult to obtain, at first priority was given to hospitals,” Dr. Onder said. “Only more recently were nursing homes added to the priority list.”
About a third of Italy’s 3,420 public or publicly funded nursing homes, which serve around 80,000 people, participated in the survey, which also sought to monitor the difficulties these structures faced during the early weeks of the outbreak. Shortages of masks, gloves and other protective equipment were reported most frequently.

980,https://www.businessinsider.com/americans-call-herd-immunity-sweden-experiment-coronavirus-not-working-2020-5,2020-05-15,Americans calling for herd immunity should look at Sweden's coronavirus experiment to see why it won't work,"Some Americans are pushing herd immunity as a way to reopen the economy in the US.

The concept of herd immunity is to stop the transmission of a virus through mass infection — the more people who have antibodies, the quicker mass immunity to the virus will be reached.

But it remains unknown if there's long-term immunity to COVID-19, and reaching herd immunity could lead to more deaths.

Health officials have called herd immunity dangerous and something that could take years to reach without a vaccine.

Sweden's approach to the novel coronavirus seems to rely on herd immunity, and it has kept businesses open throughout the pandemic.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

As Americans agitate for the reopening the economy in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic, some of them are looking at one strategy to make it feasible: herd immunity.

You don't need to look further than Sweden's anti-lockdown experiment to see why that wouldn't work.

Sweden has taken a controversially relaxed approach to COVID-19. It has not initiated a nationwide lockdown to flatten the curve. Instead, Sweden seems to be pinning its hopes on herd immunity to stop the transmission of the virus through mass infection.

The idea is if more people are infected and obtain antibodies, people will eventually gain immunity to the virus. The country has kept restaurants, schools, and gyms open and urged its residents to social distance and wash their hands.

In the US, the Trump administration has refused to set nationwide distancing rules, leading to scattershot lockdown and reopening efforts.

States across the US issued stay-at-home orders in March, and several governors are starting to reopen businesses — which if done too early, could put residents at risk of COVID-19 surges. Some people calling for economic reopenings, as well as anti-vaccine advocates, have pushed for herd immunity as a way out.

But scientists have called it dangerous rhetoric, saying that in the years people would have to wait for herd immunity to be achieved, hundreds of thousands of people could die from COVID-19. And beyond that, it remains unknown if antibodies from COVID-19 even result in long-term immunity.

No country in the world has reached herd immunity to COVID-19

Data suggests that no place has reached herd immunity to the coronavirus — less than 10% of the world has been exposed to the virus, according to estimates.

Experts say herd immunity requires 50 to 70% of the population to be exposed to the virus. Business Insider's Hilary Brueck reported that without a vaccine, it could take four to five years to reach that point.

In those four or five years, hundreds of thousands of more people could die from COVID-19. And scientists are still uncertain if a COVID-19 infection even leads to immunity.

As of Friday morning, Sweden, which has a population of 10.23 million, had 29,207 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 3,646 deaths from the virus — a death rate of 35.64 deaths per 100,000 people.

The US, meanwhile, has had 1.45 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and 86,607 deaths from the virus. With a population of 328.2 million, the country has a death rate of 26.3 deaths per 100,000 people.

Health officials have called the concept of herd immunity 'dangerous'

Epidemiologists at Johns Hopkins University have called the concept herd immunity a ""dangerous misconception"" and said the US remains vulnerable to the virus. The World Health Organization also criticized the idea of herd immunity on Monday.

""This idea that, 'Well, maybe countries who had lax measures and haven't done anything will all of a sudden magically reach some herd immunity, and so what if we lose a few old people along the way?' This is a really dangerous, dangerous calculation,"" Mike Ryan, WHO's executive director of health emergencies, said.

Ryan told reporters that humans ""are not herds,"" and such plans around building immunity would lead to only more death.

""I think we need to be really careful when we use terms in this way around natural infections in humans because it can lead to a very brutal arithmetic which does not put people and life and suffering at the center of that equation,"" he said.

The creator of Sweden's coronavirus plan even said he isn't convinced it's working

The architect behind Sweden's coronavirus plan even said he wasn't sure if the relaxed approach is working.

""I'm not convinced at all,"" Anders Tegnell, Sweden's state epidemiologist, told the Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet on May 1.

On Tuesday, Sweden even changed one aspect of its COVID-19 strategy, after seeing a high death rate in Swedish nursing homes. Prime Minister Stefan Lofven's office announced it would spend about $220 million (2.2 billion kronor) to help protect elderly people in nursing homes from the novel coronavirus.

Sweden and the US are among the 10 countries with the highest numbers of deaths per capita from COVID-19, according to data from Statista. Based on the data, Canada has nearly half the death rate of the US, at 15.1 deaths per 100,000 people.

Sweden is more densely populated than other Nordic countries, but its neighbors' death rates per capita are much lower — Norway has a rate of 4.32 deaths per 100,000 people, and Finland has a rate of 5.2.

Other nations, including Spain and Italy, have higher death rates per capita than the US and Sweden. Both countries have older populations, which affects the death rate, along with other factors, such as testing availability.

Emily Toth Martin, an associate professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan School of Public Health told Business Insider reporter Anna Medaris Miller that the only way to gain herd immunity from the virus is through a vaccine.

""This is not just about getting through the current crisis,"" she added. ""If this virus stays around, we need a vaccine to prevent resurgences in future generations.""",real

REUTERS/Kham

HANOI (Reuters) - A free trade agreement with the European Union set to soon be ratified by Vietnam should boost the Asian nation’s economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, the World Bank said on Tuesday, while urging faster reforms.

Vietnam’s legislature is expected to give its final approval later this month for a deal that would see tariff reductions on 99% of goods traded with the bloc, its second-largest export market after the United States.

Its trade minister has said he expects the agreement to take effect in July.

Vietnam’s economy grew at its slowest pace in the first quarter of this year, 3.8%, as the coronavirus outbreak hit output. But with just 324 cases and no deaths, Vietnam is set to resume economic activity sooner than its regional peers.

The European Union-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA) could boost Vietnam’s GDP and exports by 2.4% and 12% respectively over the next decade and lift hundreds of thousands of people out of poverty, the World Bank said in a report.

“Such benefits are particularly urgent to lock in positive economic gains as the country responds to the COVID-19 pandemic,” the bank said.

It said now was the perfect time for Vietnam to initiate deeper reforms and fix legal gaps and implementation issues to reap the full benefits of the agreement.",real

Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed an executive order Saturday extending the deadline to submit applications for cannabis infuser, craft grower and transporter licenses from March 30 to April 30, according to a statement from the Illinois Department of Agriculture. All applications must be submitted by certified mail.

The applications were initially due March 16, but state officials earlier this month extended that deadline and ordered the agriculture department to accept all applications by mail in an effort to reduce the spread of the coronavirus.

The 40 licenses to operate small-scale grow centers will be awarded by July 1. Another 40 licenses will go to infusers which will manufacture processed pot products, like edibles. An unspecified number of transport licenses will allow companies to deliver marijuana on behalf of growers, dispensaries or community colleges with licensed pot training programs.

“While there is no limit on how many transporter licenses will be awarded, applicants must score at least 75% of the available points and meet all other requirements before being granted a transporter license,” the agriculture department wrote in the statement.

Application fees of $5,000 will be cut in half for applicants that meet social equity requirements by living in an area adversely affected by past drug policies, having a pot-related record or having a family member that meets the criteria.

The licenses carry an annual $40,000 fee for craft growers, $10,000 for transporters and $5,000 for infusers.",real

Standing outside the Water Tower, which survived the Great Chicago Fire, Lightfoot announced a COVID-19 Recovery Task Force co-chaired by the mayor along with her longtime friend Sam Skinner.

Skinner served as White House chief of staff and U.S. Transportation Secretary under former President George H.W. Bush. He is also a former U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois.

“We don’t know when this crisis will end. … But what we do know is that, when it comes to recovering from this crisis, there are no half-measures. No cutting corners. … The crisis we face today is like nothing any of us have ever experienced. … What we are embarking on is nothing less than the most breathtaking recovery effort our city has ever seen,” the mayor said.

With the statewide stay-at-home order extended to June 1, Lightfoot acknowledged Chicago is “still very much in the thick of the fight” and a “long way from being out of the woods.”

“At the same time, we need to plan in a thoughtful, deliberative way about what the future is gonna look like at the neighborhood level, at the block level, but also at the city and the regional level. That’s what this task force is all about: Assessing the damage that’s been done, the harm — both in economic and … emotional terms — and building a framework for us to transition out of stay-at-home when that time is right,” she said.

The task force the mayor has assembled is a virtual who’s-who of Chicago power brokers.

It will be divided into five working groups: Policy and Economic Stimulus; Mental and Emotional Health; Marketing and Business Development; Regional Coordination; and Economic Change Study.

The Regional Coordination group includes Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle, who was swamped by Lightfoot in the 2019 mayoral runoff and has had a frosty relationship with the mayor ever since.

Preckwinkle applauded Lightfoot for her “strong leadership” and said it makes sense for a city and county that “share labor markets and supply chains” to work together.

She stressed the need for a recovery focused heavily on “the devastating impact” the virus has had on “black and brown communities.”

“This pandemic has forced millions of people in the region out of their jobs, with the most vulnerable communities being the hardest hit. Small businesses, not-for-profit organizations, gig workers, artists and independent contractors are experiencing unprecedented challenges and many of them are in the fight of their lives to stay operational. Recovery is paramount to all of us now,” Preckwinkle said.

“There’s no silver bullet for turning things around. But I’m convinced that we can improve our regional outlook through collaborative efforts. Regions with the least inequality perform the best. And for this to happen, we need to work together to drive this change.”

Chicago Federation of Labor President Bob Reiter will serve on a Policy and Economic Stimulus working group that includes Mellody Hobson, co-CEO of Ariel Investments and vice-chair of World Business Chicago. The Federation of Labor has an ownership stake in Sun-Times Media.

Reiter said essential workers on the front lines during the pandemic “need more than just a ‘Thank you.’ Working people need an ambitious plan for recovery that will not just return workers to the pre-pandemic status-quo, but strengthen worker protections and shape a new era of prosperity for the working class of Chicago.”

Alexa James, executive director of the National Alliance on Mental Illness Chicago, will serve on the working group for Mental and Emotional Health.

She called the pandemic impact “deep and complicated” — even on those who have lost no one they love to the virus and still have jobs and paychecks while working from home.

“Nearly everyone can identify with the fear and anxiety caused by the shutdown of our city and our economy. ... There is real grief in peoples’ hearts about what we have lost and what has changed. Whether it’s missing milestones like high school graduations and weddings, financial insecurity and instability — we are all feeling a tremendous sense of loss,” James said.

“The fears that people may have will continue, even when the stay-at-home order is lifted. Recovering from this crisis won’t be easy. … We will need to recognize the trauma that the city has faced … [and] plan a response to the long-term impact this crisis will have on the emotional health of our community.”

After introducing the task force, Lightfoot openly acknowledged Chicago Public Schools are planning for at least the possibility that remote learning may need to extend into the fall and the new school year.

“We know that … sometime in early 2021 at the earliest before there’s a vaccine. So, we have to be prepared for a lot of different contingencies, including the worst-case contingency,” she said

“We want to make sure that our children learn. … We want to stand up systems and structures now to be prepared, but also to continue to support our young people in particular because this is really, really difficult stuff on them.”",real

Pritzker apologized for criticizing baseball players for bargaining over their salaries during talks with management on how to get the coronavirus-delayed season under way.

Pritzker faulted players on Tuesday, saying “I realize that the players have the right to haggle over their salaries” but adding “I’m disappointed in many ways that players are holding out for these very, very high salaries and payments during a time when I think everybody is sacrificing.”

At his briefing on Wednesday, he said “I want to address something that I said yesterday, regarding baseball and baseball players.”

“I want to apologize for leaving the impression that baseball players shouldn’t have the right to bargain, to protect their health and safety,” Pritzker said. “I absolutely support that right, and I should have made that more clear.”

Players agreed in March to accept prorated shares of salaries during a shortened season as part of a deal that guaranteed them service time if no games are played.

Owners on Monday approved a proposal for an 82-game season. Concerned about losing money if games are played without fans, owners approved asking players to base their salaries on a 50-50 split of revenue. Players say that amounts to a salary cap and they will never agree to that framework.

First the nasty will remain inactive in a non-hostile liquid, wet or moist medium, when that environment dries out the virus can then remain dormant in a dry state for weeks to months depending on the type of virus.

Viruses are expelled out from an infected body into the air after a person sneezes or coughs. Unless covered up a sneeze can eject at over 100 miles per hour and as many as 50,000 individual aerosolized micro droplets of saliva and other moisture can be expelled to travel for a distance between 19-16 feet according to research from MIT.

Uncovered aerosolized blasts of mist expelled from the cough or sneeze will be carrying viruses and bacteria, each of these droplets can hang in the air for minutes or longer depending on the size and weight of the droplet. Anyone who is not infected can walk into these particulates and inhale them to then become infected.

In addition to inhaling the tiny aerosolized mist some of it can land in the moist eye to gain entry to the body and begin infection, all without the uninfected person knowing, and for the majority of people without them even thinking that the eye can be a portal to infection. Should an uninfected person touch a contaminated object/surface such as a door knob, elevator button, countertop, pen, or ATM/debit card station button they may even pick up disastrous microbes that have been left behind by an infected person. The potential to pick up a live virus while out in public is scary and enormous.

""These tiny droplets float through the air and you can get a cold, the flu or another illness when you come into contact with them. Sneeze and cough germs spread far and fast,"" explained Dr. Stephanie Kelleher, a Geisinger family physician.

Recently, a physician in Wuhan China says that he is positive that he became infected with the coronavirus via his eyes when he was working with infected patients. It is rather easy to do as explained above. Simple walk through an area where someone has coughed or sneezed, or even touching a contaminated area and then rubbing your eyes/mouth/nose will immediately re-activate the virus in the moisture.

Even the Ebola virus has been confirmed to be living in human eyes. Potentially any wet, moist non-hostile surface/medium/environment outside of the human body can become a host to any virus or bacteria. When that dries up they will still remain there in a dry state in wait to be picked up by someone who then will touch their mouth, nose, or eyes which will put the virus back into a wet and warm environment where it will readily begin to quickly replicate and infect its new host almost immediately.

How long a virus or bacteria can survive outside in a dry state without a host varies, in the case of TB bacteria that can be for decades. It has not yet been determined how long the coronavirus can live outside a host, but conservative projections are at least 5-7 days. Keep in mind it could be longer as in the case of HIV it has been shown to live in a dry state for far longer than that.

To protect yourself, especially when out in areas where infection is known, you should wear an N95 rated face mask with a moisture barrier, and you should consider wearing eye protection as well. Wearing gloves, washing your hands frequently and keeping them away from your face and food until you do is most important. Be aware of where you are and the potential places where transmission of disease can occur such as those touched and shared by literally thousands of people which includes retail store card terminals, pens, school/work/library desks, elevator buttons, store door handles, public restrooms, public transportation poles/handles, shopping carts, crosswalk buttons, playground equipment, handrails, steering wheels, touch screens, computers/laptops, and more, they are all just crawling and teaming with a legion of microbes.

He’s repeatedly touted the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine as a supposedly useful treatment against the Coronavirus, but there has never been any kind of systematic evidence of the drug’s actual effectiveness. Now, there’s a new study available outlining how among tens of thousands of Coronavirus patients, the drug was actually linked to a documented higher risk of death. This week, Hillary Clinton called out Trump for recklessly endangering lives with his glib promotion of the drug.

Antimalarial drug touted by Pres Trump is linked to increased risk of death in coronavirus patients, according to one study. An analysis of 96K patients shows those treated with hydroxychloroquine were also more likely to suffer irregular heart rhythms. https://t.co/XfW8r7KIe6 — Yamiche Alcindor (@Yamiche) May 22, 2020

‘A study of 96,000 coronavirus patients found that those who received a drug Trump has promoted as a treatment had a “significantly higher risk of death compared with those who did not.” The president needs to stop playing a doctor on TV.’

Trump has actually been taking the drug himself, too. He started taking the drug, supposedly, after one of his personal valets tested positive for the Coronavirus, although again, there has never been any kind of systematic evidence that the drug is actually useful for preventing the virus. In fact, one recent story circulated of a woman who contracted the Coronavirus even after she took the drug in question for 19 years as a treatment for lupus, which it’s actually approved for and useful against.

The latest study covering tens of thousands of patients is not the first suggesting that hydroxychloroquine is linked to a higher risk of death among Coronavirus patients. One study outlining results from the VA hospital system has already revealed that among veterans, the drug was also linked to a higher risk of death among Coronavirus cases. None of these developments have seemed to faze the president away from his commitment to promoting his attempts at some kind of magic fix.

If you pause mortgage payments due to the coronavirus, you can request to repay in one lump sum at the end of your loan term.

You'll make one payment when your loan term ends, or when you sell or refinance the home.

This repayment option doesn't increase your monthly bill or result in more owed interest, and it gives you time to save money for a lump sum payment.

Servicers must provide this deferral repayment option for people with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loans beginning July 1, 2020.

Read more personal finance coverage »

You may have heard that you can request forbearance for up to a year if you have a government-backed mortgage and have been impacted by the coronavirus. In fact, maybe you've already enrolled with your servicer.

When you defer your government-backed loan, your payments are paused for 180 days. You can request an extension of up to another 180 days if you're still struggling after your initial forbearance period ends.

Pausing mortgage payments can be a huge source of relief for people who have lost work during the pandemic. However, there's been a lot of confusion about how and when you're expected to repay the delayed payments — depending on your lender's repayment policy, you could end up in a major jam later.

The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has created a new deferral option for people with a loan backed by Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae, two government mortgage companies. The purpose of this deferral program is to eliminate confusion and make repayments more manageable for borrowers.

When your mortgage term ends, you repay the deferred amount in one lump sum

The premise of the FHFA's new deferral option is simple: When your loan term ends, you pay back the total deferred amount all at once, regardless of whether you sell, refinance, or pay off your home entirely.

If you have a 30-year mortgage with Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac and defer for one year during the pandemic, your loan term will still only last 30 years. At the end of the 30-year period, you'll repay the year's worth of payments you paused during the pandemic in one big payment.

If you sell your home or refinance before paying it off, you repay the deferred amount in one lump sum.

Lenders must offer this new deferral repayment option for Fannie Mae- and Freddie Mac-backed loans beginning July 1, 2020.

The new repayment method is better for many homeowners than other options

Prior to the new FHFA repayment option, lenders were enforcing various rules for how and when you had to pay back your deferred government mortgage payments. Many lenders were offering one or more of the following options:

Repay the deferred amount in one lump sum once your forbearance period ends. This policy may seem unfair if you've lost work due to the coronavirus — if you couldn't afford mortgage payments for months, why would anyone expect you to be able to make months' worth of payments all at once?

This policy may seem unfair if you've lost work due to the coronavirus — if you couldn't afford mortgage payments for months, why would anyone expect you to be able to make months' worth of payments all at once? Tack the missed payments onto the end of your loan term. For example, if you defer payments for three months, your loan term switches from 30 years to 30 years and three months. Adding payments to the end of a term is a better short-term solution, but it means you'll be paying for a longer period of time and paying more in interest.

For example, if you defer payments for three months, your loan term switches from 30 years to 30 years and three months. Adding payments to the end of a term is a better short-term solution, but it means you'll be paying for a longer period of time and paying more in interest. Spread the deferred amount across the life of your mortgage so that your monthly payment increases. This option could make mortgage payments tight — possibly for years.

The FHFA's new repayment option removes plenty of confusion from the conversation. You now have the right to request a specific repayment method rather than leave it up to your servicer.

This deferral option lets you kick the bucket down the road. Now you can pay a lump sum in a few years (or maybe even a few decades), rather than in a couple months, which gives you more time to financially prepare.

Your monthly payments will also stay the same, and you won't pay more in interest as a result of coronavirus-related forbearance.

Homeowners with other types of government-backed mortgages or loans with private lenders still have to adhere to their servicers' rules about repayments. However, people borrowing through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac finally have a little more control.",real

State Rep. Sonya Harper (D-Chicago) introduced legislation last month that would allow cannabis dispensaries to deliver marijuana to both medical pot patients and recreational customers. Now, she’s calling on Gov. J.B. Pritzker to take immediate action amid the rising public health crisis.

Related How recreational weed went from illegal to essential in 3 months

“I would be happy to see if the governor maybe could make a special executive order allowing that, or us being able to get that legislation through maybe quicker than normal this year to provide for that,” said Harper, who co-sponsored the bill that legalized pot statewide at the start of the year.

That landmark piece of legislation didn’t include a provision allowing deliveries, though lawmakers discussed the prospect while it was being drafted.

Curbside pickup allowed

Harper’s push to allow pot deliveries in the wake of the coronavirus crisis comes two weeks after officials allowed retailers to temporarily sell medical marijuana outside stores to protect patients who may be susceptible to COVID-19. The state’s more than 100,000 medical users can also have a registered caretaker pick up pot products for them.

Harper acknowledged that setting up a system for deliveries would be “more difficult” than allowing those curbside sales.

“It would entail basically giving all municipalities and everybody across the state the ability to open up deliveries,” she said. “It would also be creating a new type of license.”

Pritzker’s office didn’t respond to a request for comment, but state officials appear to be mulling whether to open up deliveries. A representative of a major Illinois cannabis firm, who asked not to be named, said the company has been included in some recent conversations.

“The state has been open-minded to evaluating and implementing new processes for the convenience of medical patients during this crisis, like curbside pickup, and conversations about how home delivery would work have definitely been part of that dialogue,” the industry insider said.

Margo Vesely, executive director of the Illinois chapter of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, said her group has recently been lobbying lawmakers to allow deliveries to medical patients.

“I think that we have to really hone in and focus on those that have those compromised immune systems and really look out for them at these times,” said Vesely. “Medical patients, if they have a weakened immune system, can’t be going into the dispensaries. And if they don’t have a caretaker, they’re stuck.

“So it would be really beneficial for them,” she added.

Harper noted that she’s recently seen people waiting to get inside dispensaries and that curbside sales are also attracting lines of cars. As officials institute strict measures to promote social distancing, she said “mobile delivery is probably needed in this time more than ever.”

However, Harper said it’s unclear whether home deliveries could be established without legislative approval, like curbside pickups. Passing her bill quickly through the Legislature also seems unrealistic, as the coronavirus has shut down sessions in Springfield for weeks.

“As it stands right now, the bill hasn’t even been heard in committee yet,” said Harper. “So we really haven’t even had a chance to discuss it, to even see any way that the bill needs to be changed or amended to meet the different needs of the different municipalities.”

“I think if we had the political will we could get together in a room and put that together now, but I do see things like that maybe taking time to figure out the details.”",real

Peskov made his last public appearance on April 30 at a meeting with President Vladimir Putin. However, it remains unknown whether the Kremlin representative contacted the president.

It was also said that Peskov was hospitalized.

The total number of positive cases in Russia since the beginning of the pandemic has exceeded 232,000 people.

The two executives pocketed almost $25 million in profits in a day's work before experts cast doubt on the vaccine's success and sent shares tumbling.

Moderna's chief financial officer Lorence Kim (left) and chief medical officer Tal Zaks (right) dumped the staggering value of stocks on Monday and Tuesday when the share price skyrocketed following the company's announcement over its vaccine trial

The biotech company released results from its COVID-19 vaccine trial Monday, after it became the first US company to start a clinical trial for a vaccine back in March.

This sparked hope that a vaccine for the deadly virus could make it to market by January and sent Wall Street investors into overdrive.

Stocks in Moderna surged as much as 30 percent Monday to $87 a share, and the company's market value climbed to $29 billion.

While investors raced to get a slice of the firm, the two insiders CFO Kim and CMO Zaks dumped the near-$30 million of shares between them on Monday and Tuesday.

According to filings, Kim also offloaded stocks in the days before the results of the trial were announced, selling 20,000 shares worth $1.3 million on May 15.

The timing of the sales may appear suspicious but Moderna insisted this week's sales from the two insiders were executed under automated insider trading plans, known as 10b5-1 plans.

Such plans lay out future stock trades at set prices or on set dates, with transactions typically being carried out without the insiders taking any action.

'These transactions are executing automatically pursuant to these trading plans,' the company said.

Experts have said this means the deals are perfectly legal.

Andrew Gordon, director of research services at Equilar, told CNN Business the executives' actions would only pose a 'legal issue if they created or modified their 10b5-1 plan while in possession of material insider information.

'It's not uncommon for insiders to sell shares they own, nor is it bad for them to capitalize on the current stock price.'

The company's share price wavered more as the week went on as the medical community gave a mixed response to the apparent success of the vaccine trials.

Shares fell further to a low of $67.05 Thursday, down 16 percent from its Monday close.

Other experts have also voiced their skepticism over the trials.

Peter Hotez, a vaccine scientist at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, told Nature.com he was 'not convinced' by Moderna's claims.

'I'm not convinced that this is really a positive result,' Hotez said.

Shares then went up again Friday to $68.60 after Dr Anthony Fauci, the federal government's top immunologist, said he was 'cautiously optimistic' about Moderna's vaccine.

'Although the numbers were limited, it was quite good news because it reached and went over an important hurdle in the development of vaccines. That's the reason why I'm cautiously optimistic about it,' Fauci said at a CNN town hall on Thursday.

The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which Fauci is head of, is developing the vaccine in collaboration with Moderna.

Dr. Carlos del Rio, an Emory University professor of medicine which is testing Moderna's vaccine, echoed Fauci's optimism in an interview with CNBC Friday.

'I am cautiously optimistic. We are developing at a pace that has never been done before,' he said.

A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump’s measures of success. But after a manic 3½ years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.

By far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. “I’m not going to play that game,” said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. “I think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they’re not uniform across states and across countries.”

But even beyond the death count, there’s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. “I’m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,” the official said.

Some Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn’t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn’t been able to focus on getting the response right.

Trump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. “So it is a war and I define victory when it’s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,” he said on May 1. “It can never be a total victory because too many people have died.”

When American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn’t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush’s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.

Others are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. “Allowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,” argued one Republican close to the president.

“The closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.” Sen. Lindsey Graham

But, he added, “If things don’t look like they’re bouncing back by September, I think that’s going to be a problem.”

The fear that Trump can’t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.

When asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump’s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the “economic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.”

A spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.

Others are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)",real

Here are the top tests ranked by accuracy, and where you can find them.","Nearly 200 companies are making tests that can tell if people had the novel coronavirus.

Called antibody or ""serology"" tests, they look for antibodies the body produces after infection.

But even as millions flood the US healthcare system, their accuracy is wide-ranging.

Sparingly few have demonstrated 100% sensitivity to the antibodies, though with small sample sizes.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Nearly 200 companies are creating tests that aim tell people if they've been exposed to the novel coronavirus.

Unlike a test that diagnoses the virus itself, the goal of these kits is to identify past exposure by looking for antibodies the body made to fight off the virus. Generally, antibodies stick around for weeks, months, or sometimes years after infections — and they often confer some level of immunity to the disease in question.

It's not yet understood how long and how well antibodies might protect a person from contracting COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. Nevertheless, experts have said large-scale antibody testing is necessary to help safely reopen the country. Employers are thinking about using it to determine which people should go back to work, and when. States, hospitals, academic centers, and laboratories are rolling them out to healthcare workers, children, and every day people with growing frequency.

But the accuracy of coronavirus antibody tests is being called into question, partly due to earlier, relaxed approval requirements by the US Food and Drug Administration. Companies rushed their kits into the US healthcare system after varying degrees of study; when problems with those tests began to pop up, the FDA released tougher approval criteria on May 4.

That said, larger healthcare groups are now offering tests to US consumers by the millions while researchers continue to independently study the performance of tests.

Quest Diagnostics is offering tests through Abbott Laboratories, PerkinElmer's Euroimmun business, and Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, for instance. Laboratory Corporation of America (LabCorp) is only offering Euroimmun's test, according to a spokesperson for the company, but for way less money than Quest's program.

The costs of antibody tests currently available to consumers ranges widely, from free (through some medical insurance policies or population surveys) to more than $100. Primary care physicians can order antibody tests for patients. You can also find them through government survey programs. New York City, for example, offers antibody tests to any children with COVID-19 symptoms through NYC Health + Hospitals, which is also using Abbott's kit.

If you're symptomatic and can't take a diagnostic test to detect the virus itself, such as through a spit or nasal swab sample, medical experts told Business Insider that it's best to wait a while before getting an antibody test. (The body takes some time to make them, so antibody tests become most accurate starting about two weeks after symptoms begin.)

The following list includes companies that have emergency authorization from the FDA, plus one with a high-performing test that doesn't yet have agency approval. Results are ranked by test sensitivity, or ability to detect true positives, though separate scores pertaining to specificity, or ability to detect true negatives, are also included. The scores are based on internal studies conducted by the companies, as well as external ones where available.",real

I don’t agree with them in areas such as how to raise or discipline my children. If I try to explain why, they mock me with their tone of voice. Then they get mad if I try to discuss it with them and won’t speak to me for a couple of weeks.

Currently, they are insisting that I am making a mountain out of a molehill because of the coronavirus. I stay at home with my children and run out only to buy food. Abby, my parents are ignoring all the health recommendations. They still go out in public places where people are close to each other.

They now want to have all their grandkids over to play and are upset with me because I refuse. It has reached the point that I don’t answer my phone when I see Mom’s number because I know she’ll lecture me on how I am “tearing the family apart over this nonsense that we’ll just laugh about next year.” How do you get family members to respect your request for social distancing? — DOING WHAT’S RIGHT FOR NOW

DEAR DOING: Here’s how: Stick to your guns. Remind your mother that your children’s welfare is your sacred responsibility. It is your job to ensure their safety, and it’s no laughing matter. Tell her this is why you have chosen to follow the directions issued by the Centers for Disease Control. You wish she and your dad would be more careful about their own health, but you respect that they are adults making their own choices, and you expect that she will extend to you the same courtesy. Period!

DEAR ABBY: I recently gave a family member a gift. Immediately upon opening it, they exclaimed, “I don’t want this! I will never use this. Can I return it and get something else?” This was followed by repeatedly saying they didn’t want the item and dragging out of the closet a similar item another family member had given them, exclaiming, “See? I already have almost the exact same thing, and I’ve never used it.”

This relative kept repeating they didn’t ever want anything like this and what I should always get them. This is the same person, by the way, who buys me whatever they want to get me whether I want it or not, and refuses to listen when I state what I would like as gifts. Am I too sensitive, or is this behavior bad manners? — GIFT HORSE IN WYOMING

DEAR GIFT HORSE: It’s an example of appalling bad manners and lack of gratitude. Because the relative is also unwilling or unable to choose appropriate gifts, why not agree to stop exchanging them? In cases like this, a nice, neutral greeting card would cause fewer hurt feelings.

DEAR ABBY: My husband and I disagree about something, and I’d like you to be the tie-breaker. One of us believes it’s proper to keep the title to a vehicle in the glove compartment of the vehicle alongside the registration and insurance papers. The other thinks it’s foolish and dangerous. What say you? — TIE-BREAKER IN KENTUCKY

DEAR TIE-BREAKER: I say it is better to err on the side of caution and keep the title in a safe deposit box or file cabinet. The same is true for the deed to your home, as well as other important documents.

A report published by the 'Independent Sage' committee, chaired by Sir David King, says that “well-functioning local test, trace, and isolate protocols” – key conditions for the UK government to relax lockdown restrictions – will not be in place by the start of June.

Until [the protocols] are, it is not safe to open schools on June 1.

New modelling shows that the risk to pupils would be halved if UK ministers delayed their proposed school opening date by two weeks, allowing more time for an effective “test, trace and isolate” program to be established, according to the science committee.

The UK government is due to publish scientific evidence on Friday from its own official SAGE (Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies) committee, which is underpinning its plan to allow primary schools to reopen in a safe manner.

PM Boris Johnson told MPs in the House of Commons on Wednesday that 25,000 contact tracers, able to track 10,000 new coronavirus cases a day, would be in place by June 1. However, the much-heralded NHS contact-tracing phone app will not be ready to be rolled out on the same date as planned.

In recent weeks, teaching unions have advised schools not to engage with the UK government about reopening until official guidance is updated to satisfy safety concerns.

Furthermore, a revolt of 68 – mainly Labour-led councils in England – has pushed Downing Street to admit it will not penalize some 1,500 primary schools who are adamant that they will disobey government calls to reopen on June 1, due to the Covid-19 outbreak.

Also on rt.com UK government CAPITULATES to rebellion of Labour-led councils over June school reopening

The report suggests that if the delay lasted until September it would be even less risky, reducing the coronavirus threat to children below the possibility of death through a road traffic accident.

It comes as Public Health England's (PHE) Medical Director Yvonne Doyle told MPs on Friday morning that “ultimately, it will be for schools to decide” whether they are ready to reopen.

The latest data published by the Department for Health and Social Care on Thursday showed that the UK’s Covid-19 death toll has surpassed 36,000.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still recommends that Americans cancel gatherings of more than 10 people “for organizations that serve higher-risk populations,” and many states have imposed limits on the number of people who can gather for any sort of party or event.

Read: A guide to staying safe as states reopen

Dave Grossman, who lives in New York City, was supposed to get married in April at an old luxury hotel 25 miles outside the city—but in early March, New York State officials directed residents to cancel any gatherings of more than 50 people. Grossman and his fiancée initially rescheduled their wedding for August, but then the venue announced it was closing for the remainder of the year. Now they’re not sure when, or where, they’ll get married.

Grossman, 44, and his fiancée, 40, both had a specific vision for what they wanted their wedding day to look like. Watching their dream crumble before their eyes, Grossman said, has been devastating: “This was supposed to be the most exciting time—like, We’re getting married soon! Instead, it’s all stress.” Naturally, though, the idea of a smaller, more low-key wedding is now starting to look more and more appealing to the pair.

When the coronavirus first hit, Kristen Maxwell Cooper, the editor in chief of the wedding website The Knot, initially saw a lot of couples push their ceremonies to later this year. But the pandemic has become a more prolonged ordeal than many of those couples expected at first—so some are turning to what Maxwell Cooper and her team at The Knot have dubbed “mini-monies,” for miniature ceremonies. Small enough to comply with size limits on gatherings and also to responsibly practice social distancing, these are pared-down, minimalist events with “usually around 10 people—just their family, maybe,” she said. Some or all of the ceremony “may be virtual. They may have a virtual officiant or something like that.” Maxwell Cooper added that most of the couples she’s seen opt for the mini-mony still plan to have a bigger celebration later on, after restrictions have lifted.

Read: We need to stop trying to replicate the life we had

Amy Jones, a wedding planner in Connecticut, told me that a few of her clients whose weddings were planned for spring and summer 2020 have chucked their original plans for a big event and gone the mini-mony route. This is especially true of those who want to get married on the sooner side so they can start a family. But more common, as Jones and other people who work in wedding-adjacent industries told me, are the clients who are (perhaps optimistically) rescheduling their weddings for the same weekend next year. As a result, scores of weddings that were supposed to take place in 2020 have been moved to 2021, and they land on the calendar on top of the weddings that were already planned for 2021 before the coronavirus arrived.",real

Here's what they look like.","IHG, Four Seasons, Omni and Caesars joined the growing list of hospitality companies updating cleanliness measures due to the new coronavirus. Short-term rental company Vrbo followed suit, too.

IHG, owner of hotel chains like InterContinental and Holiday Inn, followed many major hotel companies by announcing new cleanliness measures on May 18, in conjunction with Cleveland Clinic medical experts and Ecolab and Diversey hygiene experts. The in-progress changes may include hotel-wide extra deep-cleaning of high-touch surfaces, ""last cleaned"" charts and social distancing practices. Additional guidance for hotels may include Other changes might be individual amenity cleaning kits for guests, plus hand sanitizer and disinfecting wipes in guest rooms.

Four Seasons is partnering with Johns Hopkins Medicine International for its new global health and safety program, ""Lead With Care."" The program notes that public areas will be cleaned hourly, with extra attention to areas like the front desk counters and public restrooms; kits with masks, hand sanitizer and sanitization wipes will be in each guest room; and restaurants and bars might operate at a limited capacity for social distancing purposes, among other initiatives.

Omni's ""Safe & Clean"" initiative includes a daily health screening for employees, with a temperature check. The company is expanding its use of Environmental Protection Agency- and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-approved disinfectants. Omni is increasing the cleaning of its heating and cooling systems and replacing air filters more often. High-traffic areas will become one-way where possible. Single-use items will be placed in guest rooms, and a limited-contact check-in and check-out process will become standard.

Caesars Entertainment is assuring guests its employees are well-versed in cleaning and disinfectant practices, which includes PPE use. Multiple handwashing stations have been added to the resort, and both slot machine banks and table games will allow for social distancing going forward, among other changes.

Accor 'ALLSAFE' plan includes temperature checks; partnership brings in telemedicine consultants

Accor's ""ALLSAFE"" plan, in addition to heightened cleanliness procedures, will include temperature checks for guests and partitions at front desks. For an extra health measure, as soon as July 2020 guests will also have free access to telemedicine consultants and have access to tens of thousands of medical professionals. Accor is working with insurance company AXA Partners.

MGM Resorts: Minimize drinking, no eating on the casino floor

MGM launched its ""Seven-Point Safety Plan,"" a new standard created with medical and scientific experts to curb the spread of coronavirus, respond to possible new cases and keep customers and employees safe.

In addition to upgraded incident response protocols and contactless check-in, some of the company's focuses will be:

Screening, temperature checks and employee training: Employees will be screened for signs and symptoms of infection, and will continue to go through temperature checks. Guests are encouraged to adhere to CDC guidelines for self-quarantine and to not travel if they think they have been exposed.

Mandatory masks and PPE: Employees will be given an approved mask to wear when on the property, and guests are encouraged to wear masks in public areas. Free masks will be offered to guests who need one. Guests should limit the amount of time they are drinking on the casino floor and should not eat there.

Physical distancing: Floor guides will be throughout properties making sure people adhere to six-foot distancing. But MGM is aware distancing could prove difficult. ""From time-to-time, six-foot distancing will be challenging – and in those cases, reasonable mitigating protocols will be implemented, such as plexiglass barriers or eye protection for employees,"" according to the new policy.

Hand washing and enhanced sanitization: On top of enhanced cleaning, MGM will deploy electrostatic sprayers for more efficient disinfecting. Hand washing and sanitizing stations will also be available in high-traffic spots, along with signage.

HVAC controls and air quality: MGM has worked to minimize risk of virus transmission with HVAC systems. HVAC systems will be reviewed and adjusted pending science and government guidance.

Red Roof's RediClean initiative launches

The budget hotel chain launched Red Roof RediClean, an enhanced cleanliness program to bolster guests' confidence to stay there again.

Red Roof is asking its staff to be thorough when cleaning guest rooms (i.e. sanitizing TVs, doorknobs, light switches, faucets, etc.), and staff is sanitizing common areas like elevators, laundry rooms and front desks up to four times each day.

The company has made signage explaining guests need to wear a face covering in public spaces, per government rules. If local or state governments require facial coverings in common areas where social distancing is more difficult — think laundry rooms or indoor hallways — guests must adhere to that mandate. They are encouraged to do so (with signage) in states not requiring this.

Wyndham: 'Count on Us'

Wyndham, which has more than 6,000 hotels in the U.S., announced a new initiative called ""Count on Us"", which includes updated cleaning and disinfection procedures for guest rooms and public spaces, plus easy access to health essentials.

The chain will ship products including face masks for hotel employees, disinfectant wipes for guests and hand sanitizer. Wyndham is also set to partner with Ecolab to use its disinfectants across guest rooms and public spaces.

Best Western announces 'We Care Clean' plan

Meanwhile, Best Western's rejiggered ""We Care Clean"" plan includes enhanced sanitization procedures at the front desk and lobby, upgraded grab and go breakfast offerings in most hotels and offered more strict cleaning of public amenities like pools and fitness centers.

The hotel brand is relying on guidance from the CDC, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the EPA and Health Canada.

Sandals rolls out 'Platinum Protocols of Cleanliness'

Sandals and Beaches Resorts, which has 24 properties in seven countries, has its own new sanitation rules. The chain's Platinum Protocols of Cleanliness Program will include precautionary temperature checks, personal anti-bacterial hand towels and individual in-room hand sanitizer, according to Sandals spokesperson Rachael Salzer. Each hotel room will be maintained using UV-LED lighting equipment to inspect cleanliness, air duct sanitization for each arrival and upon each departure and weekly carpet steam-cleaning.

Vrbo

Vrbo, part of Expedia Group, has issued guidelines informed by the CDC , the World Health Organization and Cristal International Standards. Dr. Daniel Lucey, from the Infectious Diseases Society of America, advised the company. There are directives for disinfecting surfaces, ensuring time between bookings and keeping homes stocked with antibacterial hand soaps and hand sanitizers.

Homeowners and property managers will have the ability to report whether guests can check in and out without person-to-person contact or if the property can't accommodate 24 hours between guests. Guests will be able to see this information on the Vrbo app and website once hosts detail the information to the company.

The company is also offering a flexible cancellation search filter.

Hyatt aims to introduce new cleanliness accreditation process

Hyatt announced cleanliness measures last week, announcing it is relying on medical experts, industry professionals and others to ensure guests feel safe.

""We must critically examine the hotel experience from every vantage point – from our rooms and our lobbies to our spas and dining – bringing in the latest research, technology and innovation to make that happen,"" Mark Hoplamazian, Hyatt president and CEO, said in a statement.

By September, every Hyatt hotel is expected to have someone trained as a ""hygiene manager,"" who will make sure their hotel adheres to new guidelines.

These may include social distancing guidelines, prominent hand sanitizer placement, food safety and hygiene protocol implementation for restaurants and room service and increased cleaning frequency with hospital-grade disinfectants on high-touch surfaces, shared spaces and in guest rooms.

Hyatt is also developing new work procedures and trainings for its employees to address their safety and the safety of guests. This includes daily surveys that will assess colleague comfort, hotel cleanliness and more.

The company also aims to introduce a new accreditation process in May from the Global Biorisk Advisory Council across hundreds of hotels; Hyatt says it is the first to do so. This council, made up of leaders in the microbial-pathogenic threat analysis and mitigation space, is a division of ISSA, the global cleaning industry association.

Hyatt has been working with infectious disease and occupational health experts to develop the program.

As individual hotel chains, including Hyatt, Hilton and Marriott, announce their cleaning initiatives during the coronavirus pandemic, the industry at large is also working to implement to new standards to make guests feel safe.

The American Hotel & Lodging Association (AHLA) unveiled its Safe Stay guidelines on May 4, an effort made in conjunction with major brands like Hilton, Marriott and Best Western to standardize cleanliness.

""It's really an effort to make sure that no matter if you're staying at an extended-stay economy hotel or you're staying at the nicest luxury resort, that there will be at a minimum common standards across the entire industry,"" Chip Rogers, AHLA president and CEO, told USA TODAY.

The report outlines baseline hotel practices and procedures (you can find the full guidelines here) meant to protect employees and guests.

Hilton's new cleaning protocols

Hilton also said this week that it is partnering with the company behind Lysol, as well as the Mayo Clinic, to better ensure cleanliness in its hotels. The new program will be called ""Hilton CleanStay"" and aims to to give guests peace of mind when staying at a Hilton property, whether they are in guest rooms, restaurants, the gym or other public areas.

Full details are being ironed out, but several initiatives in development include:

An official room seal indicating that a room hasn't been accessed after a deep cleaning

The removal of pen, paper and guest directories in favor of a digital option (or available on request)

Contactless check-in, where guests can complete check-in and check-out processes via a mobile app and receive a digital room key (Hilton Honors members already have access to digital keys)

Electrostatic sprayers and ultraviolet light to be used in the sanitization process

Marriott updates cleaning procedures

Marriott said it will use electrostatic sprayers with hospital-grade disinfectants to sanitize throughout its hotels. In addition to guest rooms, the sprayers will be used in lobbies, gyms and other public areas. It said the cleaning agents used would be those recommended by the CDC and Prevention and the WHO to kill all known pathogens.

In addition, the company is testing ultraviolet light technology for sanitizing room keys and adding hand sanitizer stations and signs in the lobby to remind anyone who enters to keep their distance from others. Marriott is also taking a look at what to do at properties that offer buffet service.

Choice Hotels starts 'Commitment to Clean' program

Choice Hotels, too, announced a new cleaning program, which will focus on furniture arrangement to promote social distancing, stronger cleaning protocols for higher-traffic areas like front desks and personal protective equipment for hotel staff.

The ""Commitment to Clean"" program will involve the chain working with Ecolab and guidance from the CDC, WHO , U.S. Travel Association and AHLA's Safe Stay Advisory Council.

Airbnb issues cleaning recommendations

Airbnb is establishing a new recommended ""cleaning protocol"" with the goal of reassuring both rental property hosts and their guests.

For hosts, the guidelines will offer recommendations for personal protective gear, such as masks and gloves, while cleaning. Rentals will be spaced out by 24 hours for hosts who have opted in to the cleaning protocols, and hosts will have the option of an online feature that automatically prevents bookings less than 72 hours apart for an extra measure of safety.

Turnkey introduces coronavirus cleaning tips

The vacation rental service announced updates to its GuestWorks cleaning system and verification technology to best combat coronavirus. Prior to the pandemic, TurnKey was already using a housekeeping scheduler, keyless locks and in-home tablet, among other amenities, and had eliminated the need for in-person communication.

Now the system will be upgraded with updated checklists to help housekeepers disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as doorknobs, handles and light switches. In the cleaning system's app, housekeepers will have to confirm and verify through a photo the use of COVID-19-eliminating products.

It will require a 24-hour period between guest stays in May and June of this year and will extend this if necessary. Housekeepers and home inspections by TurnKey staff are permissible between stays, however.

Most Russians (80%) started going out less or stopped doing it completely as coronavirus continues spreading in Russia.

An opinion poll conducted by WCIOM All-Russian Research Fund, showed that the number of Russians who leave their homes for a walk has dropped twice. As many as 76% of respondents admitted that they started going to grocery stores or pharmacies a lot less frequently.

The absolute majority of respondents refused from personal meetings with friends and acquaintances - 84%.

69% said that they stopped shaking hands and giving hugs when meeting friends and acquaintances.

76 percent of the polled said that leave homes for urgent needs less frequently too.

88% of Muscovites said that they stopped leaving homes.

69%, said that they stopped meeting with their elderly relatives.

77% of Muscovites said that they avoid tactical contacts, while 58% stopped doing it completely.

90% of Muscovites have completely isolated themselves from friends and acquaintances.

Although the self-isolation index data show that Russians began to violate this regime more often, the majority (90%) of Muscovites polled by VTsIOM claim that most of their friends and relatives observe the rules of self-isolation. In Russia, the figure is lower, but not significantly - Most Russians (63%) assess the measures of the Russian authorities as sufficient.

1794,https://www.politico.eu/article/i-love-the-smell-of-coronavirus-in-the-morning/,2020-05-22,"If you have no sense of taste, lock yourself away immediately","Presidential reelection campaigns are generally referendums on the incumbent. A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump’s measures of success. But after a manic 3½ years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.

By far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. “I’m not going to play that game,” said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. “I think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they’re not uniform across states and across countries.”

But even beyond the death count, there’s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. “I’m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,” the official said.

Some Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn’t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn’t been able to focus on getting the response right.

Trump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. “So it is a war and I define victory when it’s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,” he said on May 1. “It can never be a total victory because too many people have died.”

When American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn’t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush’s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.

Others are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. “Allowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,” argued one Republican close to the president.

“The closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.” Sen. Lindsey Graham

But, he added, “If things don’t look like they’re bouncing back by September, I think that’s going to be a problem.”

The fear that Trump can’t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.

When asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump’s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the “economic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.”

A spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.

Others are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)",real
1829,https://www.naturalnews.com/2020-05-22-mutated-virus-coronavirus-outbreak-in-northeast-china.html,2020-05-22,Experts: “Mutated” virus involved in new coronavirus outbreak in northeast China,"(Natural News) A new cluster of COVID-19 cases has emerged in the northeastern provinces of Chinaâs Rust Belt region, with doctors noting that the virus involved in the new cases is behaving differently compared to the one first encountered in Wuhan late last year.

According to Qiu Haibo, an expert in critical care medicine who is part of the National Health Commission expert group, the virus found in patients in the provinces of Jilin and Heilongjiang was unique, in that its incubation period was longer compared to that of the patients in Wuhan.

In addition, Qiu noted that while Wuhanâs patients suffered severe lung, myocardial, renal and intestinal damage, the cases in Chinaâs Rust Belt mainly showed lung damage, with very slight damage to the heart, kidney or intestines.

The Rust Belt cases too, were largely asymptomatic, in the sense that they did not manifest any elevations in their temperature and only exhibited minor symptoms such as sore throats and fatigue.

âThis causes a problem, as they donât have any symptoms. So when they gather with their families they donât care about this issue and we see family cluster infections,â Qiu told state broadcaster CCTV, Tuesday.

Qiu, in his interview, said the strain of the virus found in the Rust Belt clusters was probably imported from abroad, which could explain the differences between the Wuhan and Jilin cases.

According to authorities, the first case of infection was reported early this month in Jilin Province, which borders Russia and North Korea. This infection then spread to the cities of Jilin, Shulan and Shengyang.

State media Xinhua, meanwhile, reported that the province logged a total of 135 confirmed locally transmitted cases, of which 108 had been discharged.Â Twenty-fiveÂ individuals, as per local media, are still hospitalized.Â (Related: New coronavirus strain may be emerging and causing survivors to get REINFECTED.)

As a response to the new cases, Chinese President Xi Jinping has called for strengthened measures to contain the infection, including the halting of public transport services, the sealing off of residential compounds in some of the cities in the region, and the creation of an emergency response team.

Five hundredÂ medical professionals have also been tapped to help address the outbreak, as confirmed by Liu Qizhi, director of the Jilin municipal health authority.

Experts confirm: Coronavirus may be mutating

Perhaps due to intensified worry and speculation over a second wave of potentially fatal coronavirus infections, public speculation on coronavirus mutations have since flooded the internet.

Experts, however, say this fascination with viral mutations may be a case of much ado about nothing.

As with all known viruses, it is normal for the coronavirus to change and mutate, according to Nels Elde, an associate professor of human genetics at the University of Utah.

âViruses mutate. Thatâs one of the things that makes them such a successful entity,â Elde said in an interview with ABC News, noting that because viruses are constantly copying themselves, it is inevitable for some of its copies to manifest random mistakes or mutations.

âThe word âmutationâ to people means something bad because itâs got that connotation to it,â Vincent Racaniello, a professor of microbiology at Columbia University Medical Center, noted.

According to Racaniello, âmutationâ in the context of viruses simply means a change in their genome sequence.

âIt doesnât mean that itâs necessarily bad for you at all,â Racaniello said.

Keiji Fukuda, director and clinical professor at the University of Hong Kongâs School of Public Health, had the same sentiment, noting in an interview with BloombergÂ that while some changes in the genetic structure can, in theory, lead to changes in the virusâs structure or its behavior, many mutations lead to no actual and discernible changes at all.

Lucy Van Dorp, a research associate with the University College Londonâs Genetics Institute, meanwhile, noted in an interview with Al Jazeera that while 198 mutations of the virus have been found so far, the vast majority of mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome are likely to be neutral or without impact.

As of press time, the coronavirus has infected 5,127,125 and killed 333,398Â according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

Swedish police and social services have sounded the alarm over a new phenomenon: young people selling themselves to make ends meet after admittedly having lost their jobs due to the Covid-19 epidemic.

“Their parents also spoke about this. We are talking low-paying jobs, such as fast-food restaurants,” Malin Andersson, Secretary of Social Affairs for the Stockholm City Youth Rapid Response Team, told the newspaper Dagens Nyheter.

During the recent Operation Cod that targeted sex buyers in Stockholm, the police identified at least five people below the age of 18 who provided sexual services for money. Their sex ads said “Lost my extra job”, the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet reported.

“We clearly see increased activity among young people,” Detective Inspector Simon Häggström told Svenska Dagbladet. “They themselves say this is due to corona, that they have no job, and that they just sit at home. It is definitely a new group of young people making their debut now. It's alarming,” Häggström added.

Andersson said that some young people have been feeling unwell psychologically, and this trend only worsened while the schools were closed.

“They feel isolated. If a person falls into this sphere, usually there are some reasons. Everyone there feels bad, due to different circumstances. We can talk about previous traumas due to which one now feels completely alone, estranged from others,” Malin Andersson explained.

According to the social services, most young people started with sites for “sugar dating”, where wealthy adults seek out younger partners for money.

“This implies a very big risk. People who are interested in children have already crossed the threshold, they don’t care what the child thinks. Also, they are very good at persuading,” Andersson said.

When the police and social services identify sex workers who are younger than 18, they are taken home to their parents and offered help and support.

“Now we see more active male users on sugar dating sites, and young people are more likely to post ads offering sexual services. All this is very serious, as we know: very often this kind of arrangement is a direct gateway to prostitution,” Stockholm City social affairs councillor Jan Jönsson said, pledging to address the matter.

Sweden's present-day legislation on prostitution make it illegal to buy sex, but not to sell it. Pimping and operating brothers is also illegal. It was Sweden that pioneered the criminalisation of the purchase, but not the selling of sex back in 1999. Since then the Nordic model has spread to other nations, including Canada and Ireland.

With 32,172 confirmed Covid-19 cases and close to 3,900 deaths, Sweden is the worst-hit Scandinavian nation.

The UFC recently got back up and running with three events in a week in Jacksonville, Florida, and has another card planned for May 30 at its own Apex venue in Las Vegas - subject to Nevada state approval.

Beyond that, White says he is planning on finally putting his 'Fight Island' plan into action - an idea which first emerged when the coronavirus outbreak began to ravage sport in the US.

“People are very intrigued by ‘Fight Island,’ and I’m excited for it,” White told ESPN on Friday.

“Right now, we’re looking at June and we’re literally going to knock out three or four fights there in a month… I’ll probably be there the whole month of July.”@danawhite gives @Jon_Anik the latest update on Fight Island 🏝 pic.twitter.com/J5r6dbHnFn — ESPN MMA (@espnmma) May 22, 2020

“Right now we’re looking at June, and we’re literally gonna knock out three or four (events) there in a month.

""And I’m gonna stay on the island for a month. I’ll probably be there the whole month of July.”

The location of the island remains a secret, although White has previously said it will be in international waters, and will provide a primary opportunity for non-US-based fighters to compete while the Covid-19 pandemic subsides.

While no official cards have been confirmed for the venue, one person excited to fight there is women's flyweight Paige VanZant, who this week teased her comeback fight with the line ""coming to an island near you.""
